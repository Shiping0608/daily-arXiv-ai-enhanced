For the\nevolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite\nvolume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built\non the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact\nstencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs\n(LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally\nproposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific\nComputing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to\ndiscretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a\nscaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity\nby blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source\nterm. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence\nerror is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the\ncell average.
