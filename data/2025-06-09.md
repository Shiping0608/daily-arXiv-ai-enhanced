### [1] [Approximation of the Pseudospectral Abscissa via Eigenvalue Perturbation Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05535)
*Waqar Ahmed,Emre Mengi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of computing the pseudospectral abscissa in large-scale settings, proposing eigenvalue perturbation theory for small ε and fixed-point iterations for larger ε.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for large-scale pseudospectral abscissa computation are only locally convergent, lacking globally reliable solutions.

Method: Uses eigenvalue perturbation theory for small ε and introduces fixed-point iterations for larger ε, suitable for large-scale problems.

Result: Eigenvalue perturbation provides accurate estimates for small ε, while fixed-point iterations converge globally in most tested cases.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve reliability and efficiency in large-scale pseudospectral abscissa computation.

Abstract: Reliable and efficient computation of the pseudospectral abscissa in the
large-scale setting is still not settled. Unlike the small-scale setting where
there are globally convergent criss-cross algorithms, all algorithms in the
large-scale setting proposed to date are at best locally convergent. We first
describe how eigenvalue perturbation theory can be put in use to estimate the
globally rightmost point in the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum if $\epsilon$ is
small. Our treatment addresses both general nonlinear eigenvalue problems, and
the standard eigenvalue problem as a special case. For small $\epsilon$, the
estimates by eigenvalue perturbation theory are quite accurate. In the standard
eigenvalue case, we even derive a formula with an ${\mathcal O}(\epsilon^3)$
error. For larger $\epsilon$, the estimates can be used to initialize the
locally convergent algorithms. We also propose fixed-point iterations built on
the the perturbation theory ideas for large $\epsilon$ that are suitable for
the large-scale setting. The proposed fixed-point iterations initialized by
using eigenvalue perturbation theory converge to the globally rightmost point
in the pseudospectrum in a vast majority of the cases that we experiment with.

*Ichitaro Yamazaki,Nathan Ellingwood,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: ShyLU-node is an open-source package for linear solvers and preconditioners on CPUs/GPUs, featuring Basker, Tacho, and FastILU for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide robust and efficient solutions for large-scale linear systems on modern and emerging computing architectures.

Method: Implements sparse direct solvers (Basker, Tacho) and an algebraic preconditioner (FastILU) for standalone or domain decomposition use.

Result: Demonstrated performance in real applications (Xyce Circuit Simulations, Albany Land-Ice Simulation) and 3D model problems.

Conclusion: ShyLU-node offers versatile and efficient solvers/preconditioners for diverse applications.

Abstract: ShyLU-node is an open-source software package that implements linear solvers
and preconditioners on shared-memory multicore CPUs or on a GPU. It is part of
the Trilinos software framework and designed to provide a robust and efficient
solution of large-scale linear systems from real-world applications on the
current and emerging computers. In this paper, we discuss two sparse direct
solvers, Basker and Tacho, and an algebraic preconditioner, FastILU, in
ShyLU-node package. These ShyLU solvers and preconditioner can be used as a
stand-alone global problem solver, as a local subdomain solver for domain
decomposition (DD) preconditioner, or as the coarse-problem solver in algebraic
multi-grid preconditioner. We present performance results with the sparse
direct solvers for real application problems, namely, Basker for Xyce Circuit
Simulations and Tacho for Albany Land-Ice Simulation of Antarctica. FastILU has
been also used in real-world applications, but in this paper, we illustrate its
performance using 3D model problems.

exponential weights in time. We analyze the method, showing its stability
without imposing any restrictions on the mesh size or time step, and proving
quasi-optimal convergence for any choice of space-time tensor product discrete
spaces that satisfies standard approximation assumptions. Numerical examples
are provided to support the theoretical findings.

### [4] [Global dynamics above the ground state for the energy-critical Hartree equation with radial data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05406)
*Xuemei Li,Chenxi Liu,Guixiang Xu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper extends the study of radial solutions for the focusing energy-critical Hartree equation, focusing on dynamics when energy is slightly above the ground state. It adapts methods from prior works on NLS, NLW, and NLKG, using hyperbolic dynamics and variational analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify long-time dynamics of radial solutions for the Hartree equation when energy is slightly above the ground state, building on previous results for subcritical cases.

Method: Adapts concentration-compactness-rigidity and non-degeneracy arguments, analyzing hyperbolic dynamics near the ground state and variational structure elsewhere. Uses ejection dynamics and the one-pass lemma.

Result: Classifies solutions by their behavior near the ground state, leveraging hyperbolic dynamics and variational analysis.

Conclusion: Extends prior results to the Hartree equation, providing a framework for understanding dynamics with energy slightly above the ground state.

Abstract: Based on the concentration-compactness-rigidity argument in
\cite{KenM:NLS,KenM:NLW} and the non-degeneracy of the ground state in
\cite{LLTX:Nondeg,LLTX:g-Hart,LTX:Nondeg}, long time dynamics for the focusing
energy-critical Hartree equation with radial data have been classified when the
energy $E(u_0)\leq E(W)$ in \cite{LiMZ:crit Hart,LLTX:g-Hart,MWX:Hart,MXZ:crit
Hart:f rad}, where $W$ is the ground state. In this paper, we continue the
study on the dynamics of the radial solutions with the energy $E(u_0)$ at most
slightly larger than that of the ground states. This is an extension of the
results \cite{KriNS:NLW rad, KriNS:NLW
non,NakR,NakS:NLKG,NakS:book,NakS:NLS,NakS:NLKG:non,Roy} on NLS, NLW and NLKG,
which were pioneered by K. Nakanishi and W. Schlag in \cite{NakS:NLKG,
NakS:book} in the study of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in the subcritical
case. The argument is an adaptation of the works in \cite{KriNS:NLW rad,
KriNS:NLW non,NakR,Roy}, the proof uses an analysis of the hyperbolic dynamics
near the ground state and the variational structure far from them. The key
components that allow to classify the solutions are the hyperbolic (ejection)
dynamical behavior near the ground state and the one-pass lemma.

### [5] [On the orbital stability of periodic snoidal waves for the $φ^4-$equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05547)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the global well-posedness
and orbital stability of odd periodic traveling waves for the $\phi^4$-equation
in the Sobolev space of periodic functions with zero mean. We establish new
results on the global well-posedness of weak solutions by combining a semigroup
approach with energy estimates. As a consequence, we prove the orbital
stability of odd periodic waves by applying a Morse index theorem to the
constrained linearized operator defined in the Sobolev space with the zero mean
property.

### [6] [Existence and uniqueness of classical solution to an initial-boundary value problem for the unsteady general planar Broadwell model with four velocities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05658)
*Koudzo Togbévi Selom Sobah,Amah Séna d'Almeida*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence and uniqueness of a non-negative continuous solution for the planar Broadwell model with bounded initial and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsteady problem for the general planar Broadwell model with four velocities, ensuring solutions under realistic conditions.

Method: Imposing non-negative, bounded, and continuous initial and Dirichlet boundary data with first-order partial derivatives.

Result: Proved existence and uniqueness of a non-negative continuous solution with bounded first-order partial derivatives.

Conclusion: The initial-boundary value problem for the Broadwell model has a well-defined solution under the given conditions.

Abstract: We consider the unsteady problem for the general planar Broadwell model with
four velocities in a rectangular spatial domain over a finite time interval. We
impose a class of non-negative initial and Dirichlet boundary data that are
bounded and continuous, along with their first-order partial derivatives. We
then prove the existence and uniqueness of a non-negative continuous solution,
bounded together with its first-order partial derivatives, to the
initial-boundary value problem.

### [7] [Quantitative stability control of the full spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian by the second eigenvalue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05870)
*Alexis de Villeroché*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be an open set of finite measure and let
$\Theta$ be a disjoint union of two balls of half measure. We study the
stability of the full Dirichlet spectrum of $\Omega$ when its second eigenvalue
is close to the second eigenvalue of $\Theta$. Precisely, for every $k \in
\mathbb{N}$, we provide a quantitative control of the difference
$|\lambda_k(\Omega)-\lambda_k(\Theta)|$ by the variation of the second
eigenvalue $C(d,k)(\lambda_2(\Omega)-\lambda_2(\Theta))^\alpha$, for a suitable
exponent $\alpha$ and a positive constant $C(d,k)$ depending only on the
dimension of the space and the index $k$. We are able to find such an estimate
for general $k$ and arbitrary $\Omega$ with $\alpha =\frac{1}{d+1}$. In the
particular case when $\lambda_k(\Omega)\geq \lambda_k(\Theta)$, we can improve
the inequality and find an estimate with the sharp exponent $\alpha =
\frac{1}{2}$.

### [8] [Elementary discrete diffusion/redistancing schemes for the mean curvature flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05946)
*Antonin Chambolle,Daniele De Gennaro,Massimiliano Morini*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A fully discrete, explicit scheme for mean curvature flow of boundaries is proposed, combining diffusion and redistancing. Convergence is proven under CFL condition, with extensions to general schemes discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple, explicit numerical scheme for mean curvature flow with provable convergence.

Method: Uses a diffusion step and redistancing operation under CFL condition (h ∼ ε²).

Result: Convergence is proven under the given condition.

Conclusion: The scheme is effective and extendable to more general convolution/redistancing methods.

Abstract: We consider here a fully discrete and explicit scheme for the mean curvature
flow of boundaries, based on an elementary diffusion step and a precise
redistancing operation. We give an elementary convergence proof for the scheme
under the standard CFL condition $h\sim\varepsilon^2$, where $h$ is the time
discretization step and $\varepsilon$ the space step. We discuss extensions to
more general convolution/redistancing schemes.

### [9] [Variational Nonlinear and Nonlocal Curvature Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05951)
*Daniele De Gennaro*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows convergence of minimizing movements to level-set solutions for nonlinear nonlocal curvature flows with time-dependent forcing, under minimal assumptions on the nonlinearity. Uniqueness of solutions is also proven under additional curvature conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of minimizing movements and level-set solutions in nonlinear nonlocal curvature flows, particularly with time-dependent forcing, under general variational curvature frameworks.

Method: Uses the minimizing movements scheme (Almgren-Taylor-Wang) and analyzes convergence to level-set solutions. Assumes continuity, monotonicity, and vanishing at zero for the nonlinearity.

Result: Convergence of the scheme to level-set solutions is proven. Uniqueness of these solutions is established under further curvature assumptions.

Conclusion: The work generalizes results for nonlinear nonlocal curvature flows, providing convergence and uniqueness under minimal and additional assumptions, respectively.

Abstract: We prove that the minimizing movements scheme \'a la Almgren-Taylor-Wang
converges towards level-set solutions to a nonlinear version of nonlocal
curvature flows with time-depending forcing term, in the rather general
framework of variational curvatures introduced in \cite{ChaMorPon15}. The
nonlinearity involved is assumed to satisfy minimal assumptions, namely
continuity, monotonicity, and vanishing at zero. Under additional assumptions
only on the curvatures involved, we establish uniqueness for level-set
solutions.

### [10] [Orbital Stability of Plane Waves in the Klein-Gordon Equation against Localized Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06029)
*Emile Bukieda,Louis Garénaux,Björn de Rijk*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the stability of spatially periodic plane waves in the complex Klein-Gordon equation under localized perturbations, developing a new method for orbital stability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orbital stability theory is inadequate for analyzing waves under localized perturbations, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: The authors use an amplitude-phase decomposition and leverage conserved quantities tailored to the perturbation equation, inspired by Zhidkov's work.

Result: They establish a locally uniform orbital stability result for plane waves, accommodating $L^2$-localized perturbations and nonlocalized phase modulations, even allowing unbounded modulations in some regimes.

Conclusion: The method is sharp, holding up to the spectral stability boundary, and provides a robust framework for analyzing such systems.

Abstract: We investigate the stability and long-term behavior of spatially periodic
plane waves in the complex Klein-Gordon equation under localized perturbations.
Such perturbations render the wave neither localized nor periodic, placing its
stability analysis outside the scope of the classical orbital stability theory
for Hamiltonian systems developed by Grillakis, Shatah, and Strauss. Inspired
by Zhidkov's work on the stability of time-periodic, spatially homogeneous
states in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we develop an alternative
method that relies on an amplitude-phase decomposition and leverages conserved
quantities tailored to the perturbation equation. We establish an orbital
stability result of plane waves that is locally uniform in space, accommodating
$L^2$-localized perturbations as well as nonlocalized phase modulations. In
certain regimes, our method even allows for unbounded modulations. Our result
is sharp in the sense that it holds up to the spectral stability boundary.

### [11] [Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for collisional-radiative argon plasma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05483)
*Ivan Zanardi,Alessandro Meini,Alberto Padovan,Daniel J. Bodony,Marco Panesi*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A reduced-order model (ROM) for collisional-radiative argon plasma is developed, achieving significant computational savings while accurately capturing complex plasma dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas is computationally expensive, and traditional simplifications often fail to retain essential dynamics under strong nonequilibrium conditions.

Method: A Petrov-Galerkin ROM based on oblique projections is developed, balancing state trajectories and output sensitivities. It is trained offline and applied to 1D and 2D shock-tube problems.

Result: The ROM reduces state dimension by 3× and computational cost by over an order of magnitude, with errors below 1%. It accurately reproduces complex plasma features.

Conclusion: The ROM enables efficient and reliable simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas, preserving key physical mechanisms.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas -- crucial to applications
in electric propulsion, hypersonic re-entry, and astrophysical flows --
requires state-specific collisional-radiative (CR) kinetic models, but these
come at a prohibitive computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been
mitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing
equations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features
of the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions.
To address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model
(ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance
the covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's
output sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the
dominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output
behavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear
forward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver
and applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems.
The ROM achieves a 3$\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one
order of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining
errors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly
reproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations,
electron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in
contrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under
these challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key
physical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast,
reliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.

### [12] [Application-specific Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials: Exploring the Trade-off Between Precision and Computational Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05646)
*Ilgar Baghishov,Jan Janssen,Graeme Henkelman,Danny Perez*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in fitting high-quality machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and proposes strategies to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the time-consuming and computationally intensive process of fitting MLIPs, which involves trade-offs in training set selection, reference simulation precision, and model complexity.

Method: The study explores simultaneous consideration of training set strategies, energy vs. force weighting, ab initio precision, and model complexity to optimize MLIP training and evaluation.

Result: The approach leads to a significant reduction in computational costs for training and evaluating MLIPs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: This enables efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for diverse applications with varying accuracy and cost trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing
computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient
alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However,
fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and
computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered,
e.g. How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the
training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to
generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the
MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The
answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of
MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD
simulations. In this study, we highlight that simultaneously considering
training set selection strategies, energy versus force weighting, precision of
the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity and
computational cost of MLIPs can lead to a significant reduction in the overall
computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens
the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a
range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and
evaluation cost trade-offs.

### [13] [Mapping correlations and coherence: adjacency-based approach to data visualization and regularity discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05758)
*Guang-Xing Li*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm to map correlations in complex data using the Stokes parameter, enabling spatially resolved analysis of correlation types and strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of systematically revealing regularities in increasingly complex data, where traditional correlation methods may fail due to spatial inhomogeneity and complexity.

Method: An algorithm that leverages the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector via the Stokes parameter to create spatially resolved correlation maps.

Result: The method identifies subregions with distinct correlation types, useful for physical systems or climate maps, and is broadly applicable due to its simplicity.

Conclusion: This approach offers a new, efficient way to represent data and can aid in developing computational methods for regularity discovery.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

### [14] [Revealing hidden correlations from complex spatial distributions: Adjacent Correlation Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05759)
*Guang-Xing Li*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called adjacent correlation analysis to uncover hidden correlations in complex physical systems by focusing on local regions and representing them in phase space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the emergence of patterns and structures in physical systems is limited, especially when direct correlation searches are impractical due to complexity and spatial inhomogeneity.

Method: The proposed method, adjacent correlation analysis, extracts local correlations and represents them as vectors in phase space, overlaid on Probability Density Function (PDF) plots.

Result: The correlation vectors reveal regular patterns, potentially leading to new physical laws, and are equivalent to vector fields in dynamical systems.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient representation of spatial patterns, aiding classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and forecasting in complex systems.

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

### [15] [Addressing geometrical perturbations by applying generalized polynomial chaos to virtual density in continuous energy Monte-Carlo power iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06046)
*Théophile Bonnet,Anuj Dubey,Eugene Shwageraus*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using surface tracking and generalized polynomial chaos to model reactivity changes from uniform geometrical perturbations in Monte Carlo simulations, with limitations when perturbations affect the neutron energy spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately estimate reactivity changes caused by uniform geometrical perturbations (like expansion or swelling) in continuous-energy Monte Carlo simulations.

Method: Combines surface tracking for explicit perturbation effects and generalized polynomial chaos for reduced model coefficients.

Result: Accurate for perturbations not altering the neutron energy spectrum but fails when spectrum changes significantly.

Conclusion: The method is effective for specific cases but has limitations when perturbations impact the energy spectrum.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the use of the virtual density method to model
uniform geometrical perturbations. We propose a general algorithm using surface
tracking in order to estimate explicitly the effect of geometrical
perturbations in continuous-energy Monte Carlo simulations, and we apply the
intrinsic generalized polynomial chaos method in order to estimate the
coefficients of a reduced model giving the multiplication factor as a function
of the amplitude of the geometrical perturbation. Our method accurately
estimates the reactivity change induced by uniform expansion or swelling
deformations that do not significantly modify the neutron energy spectrum, for
a large range of deformations within a single Monte Carlo simulation. On the
other hand, the method may fail when the effect of the geometrical perturbation
on the energy spectrum is significant enough.

### [16] [Robustness of complexity estimation in event-driven signals against accuracy of event detection method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06168)
*Marco Cafiso,Paolo Paradisi*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of event detection tools on accurately estimating temporal complexity in noisy signals, using the RTEF-EDDiS pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting rapid transition events (RTEs) in noisy signals and quantify how event detection tools affect complexity estimation.

Method: The study evaluates the Event-Driven Diffusion Scaling (EDDiS) algorithm and introduces the RTE-Finder (RTEF) method, testing their performance on synthetic signals.

Result: The RTEF's reliability depends on parameters like percentile, and false positives can exceed genuine events. However, complexity estimation remains robust, with scaling errors of 4-7% for power-law IETs with μ ≤ 2.5.

Conclusion: Despite high false positives, the RTEF-EDDiS pipeline provides reliable complexity estimation, with certain conditions even improving accuracy.

Abstract: Complexity has gained recent attention in machine learning for its ability to
extract synthetic information from large datasets. Complex dynamical systems
are characterized by temporal complexity associated with intermittent
birth-death events of self-organizing behavior. These rapid transition events
(RTEs) can be modelled as a stochastic point process on the time axis, with
inter-event times (IETs) revealing rich dynamics. In particular, IETs with
power-law distribution mark a departure from the Poisson statistics and
indicate the presence of nontrivial complexity that is quantified by the
power-law exponent $\mu$ of the IET distribution. However, detection of RTEs in
noisy signals remains a challenge, since false positives can obscure the
statistical structure of the underlying process. In this paper, we address the
problem of quantifying the effect of the event detection tool on the accuracy
of complexity estimation. This is reached through a systematic evaluation of
the Event-Driven Diffusion Scaling (EDDiS) algorithm, a tool exploiting
event-driven diffusion to estimate temporal complexity.After introducing the
event detection method RTE-Finder (RTEF), we assess the performance of the
RTEF-EDDiS pipeline using event-driven synthetic signals. The reliability of
the RTEF is found to strongly depend on parameters such as the percentile and
the number of false positives can be much higher than the number of genuine
complex events. Despite this, we found that the complexity estimation is quite
robust with respect to the rate of false positives. For the power-law
distributed IETs with $\mu\le2.5$, the second moment scaling $H$ appears to
even improve as the rate of false positives increases, reaching estimation
errors of about 4-7%.

### [17] [Investigation of Neoclassical Tearing Mode Detection by ECE Radiometry in Tokamak Reactors via Asymptotic Matching Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05553)
*R. Fitzpatrick*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses the TJ toroidal tearing mode code to predict electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals from neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) in an ITER-like tokamak, analyzing magnetic field harmonics and temperature perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide realistic predictions of ECE signals from NTMs in tokamak plasmas, aiding in understanding and diagnosing plasma behavior.

Method: The study divides the plasma into inner and outer regions, coupling helical harmonics of the magnetic field and matching solutions asymptotically. A simulated ECE diagnostic accounts for relativistic effects.

Result: The method determines the NTM's magnetic structure and global electron temperature perturbation, with the ECE diagnostic simulating signal frequency shifts.

Conclusion: The approach offers a detailed framework for predicting ECE signals from NTMs, enhancing tokamak plasma diagnostics.

Abstract: The TJ toroidal tearing mode code is used to make realistic predictions of
the electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals generated by neoclassical tearing
modes (NTMs) in an ITER-like tokamak plasma equilibrium. In the so-called
"outer region'', which comprises the bulk of the plasma, helical harmonics of
the magnetic field with the same toroidal mode number as the NTM, but different
poloidal mode numbers, are coupled together by the Shafranov shifts and shaping
of the equilibrium magnetic flux-surfaces. In the "inner region'', which is
localized in the vicinity of the NTM rational surface, helical harmonics whose
poloidal and toroidal mode numbers are in the same ratio as those of the NTM
are coupled together nonlinearly to produce a radially asymmetric magnetic
island chain. The solutions in the inner and outer regions are asymptotically
matched to one another. The asymptotic matching process determines the overall
magnetic structure of the NTM, as well as the global perturbation to the
electron temperature caused by the mode. A simulated ECE diagnostic is
developed that accounts for the downshifting and broadening in frequency of the
signal due to the relativistic mass increase of the emitting electrons.

*Matt Russell*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores a modified Bennett profile for Z-pinch equilibria by shifting nonlinearity to plasma flow velocity, preserving magnetic structure while introducing vortical flow. It investigates its potential for shear-flow stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study a new equilibrium for Z-pinch plasmas by transferring nonlinearity to flow velocity, aiming to explore shear-flow stabilization effects.

Method: Transfers nonlinearity from number density to plasma flow velocity, maintaining magnetic structure and introducing vortical flow. Analyzes the equilibrium's validity for shear-flow stabilization.

Result: The modified equilibrium retains the original magnetic structure but now includes vortical flow, with potential implications for shear-flow stabilization.

Conclusion: The study suggests the modified Bennett profile could be valid for shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch equilibria, offering new insights for fusion energy research.

Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an
equilibrium Z pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma
physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By
transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma
flow velocity the magnetic structure of the resulting flowing Z-pinch
equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which
previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the monotonic structure of
the nonlinearities first derivative, this analytic equilibrium is investigated
to determine its validity as a Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-Pinch

*Camille Granier,Daniel Groselj,Luca Comisso,Fabio Bacchini*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid formation in magnetically dominated pair plasmas using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, revealing key conditions for reconnection onset and plasmoid development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the explosive release of magnetic energy in magnetospheres of compact objects and their surroundings.

Method: 2D particle-in-cell simulations of two force-free flux tubes pushed together, forming a current sheet that shrinks until reconnection occurs.

Result: Reconnection onset occurs in 2-6 light-crossing times, with plasmoid chains forming for sheet aspect ratios ≥30. Magnetic energy dissipation aligns with a normalized reconnection rate of ~0.1.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into magnetic energy release in compact object magnetospheres, highlighting the role of plasmoid formation and reconnection dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the onset of driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid
formation in a magnetically dominated pair plasma, using 2D particle-in-cell
simulations. Two force-free flux tubes of radius $R$ are initially pushed
together with a prescribed velocity, forming a current sheet whose width
shrinks until reconnection sets in. % Even in our largest simulation with
$R\approx 1600$ plasma skin depths, the sheet thickness at reconnection onset
is comparable to the skin depth. Plasmoid chains are seen to develop when the
sheet aspect ratio $A\gtrsim30$. In the strongly magnetized limit, the onset of
reconnection occurs in roughly $2$ to $6$ light-crossing times $R/c$, depending
on the imposed driving timescale, which controls the duration of the linear
tearing phase. In the subsequent nonlinear merging phase, the evolution becomes
effectively independent of the initially imposed velocity, leading to magnetic
energy dissipation consistent with a normalized reconnection rate $\sim 0.1$.
Our results have important implications for explosive release of magnetic
energy in magnetospheres of compact objects and their surroundings.

### [20] [Mean Force Emission Theory for Classical Bremsstrahlung in Electron-Ion Plasmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06177)
*Julian P. Kinney,Heath J. LeFevre,Carolyn C. Kuranz,Scott D. Baalrud*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends mean force emission theory for electron-ion plasmas, incorporating the Kelbg potential for quantum effects and attractive interactions, revealing impacts on bremsstrahlung spectra and transport coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the description of electron-ion plasmas by accounting for quantum effects and attractive interactions, addressing limitations of classical models.

Method: Extends mean force emission theory, uses the Kelbg potential for quantum effects, and compares results with molecular dynamics simulations and classical/quantum Gaunt factors.

Result: The Kelbg potential captures quantum modifications but fails at very high frequencies. Peaks in emission near plasma frequency are identified, and screening reduces bremsstrahlung power in certain plasmas.

Conclusion: The framework links bremsstrahlung emission to transport coefficients, offering broader applicability. The study highlights limitations of classical corrections and the role of quantum effects.

Abstract: This work extends the previously developed mean force emission theory to
describe electron-ion plasmas. Results are compared to molecular dynamics
simulations. The main extensions are to account for the attractive nature of
electron-ion interactions and to model short-range quantum effects using the
Kelbg potential. By reducing the electron-ion force inside the deBroglie
wavelength, the Kelbg potential causes a decay at high frequencies and a
decrease in magnitude of the low frequency bremsstrahlung spectrum. The
attractive electron-ion interaction also allows for classically bound states
that show up as peaks in the emission spectrum. Results show that the Kelbg
potential can capture quantum modifications to classical Gaunt factors, but is
limited in describing emission at very high frequencies. This work further
supports the notion that there is a peak in emission near the plasma frequency
at strong coupling that cannot be captured using the common Drude correction.
Importantly, the linear response framework used to calculate the bremsstrahlung
emission coefficient is related to both the absorption coefficient and the real
part of the dynamic electrical conductivity. This means that the conclusions
drawn from this study can be applied to these transport coefficients as well.
Finally, this work compares the results with commonly used classical and
quantum mechanical Gaunt factors, and discusses the impact of a Fermi-Dirac
distribution of electrons on emission and why screening slightly reduces the
bremsstrahlung power in weakly coupled and non-degenerate plasmas.

*Wenhao Wu,Fuhong Liu,Haoru Li,Zican Hu,Daoyi Dong,Chunlin Chen,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2MIR introduces a token- and task-wise MoE framework for in-context RL, addressing multi-modality and task diversity, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in ICRL include multi-modality of data and task heterogeneity. T2MIR aims to enhance in-context learning by leveraging MoE.

Method: T2MIR replaces feedforward layers with token-wise and task-wise MoE layers, using contrastive learning for task-wise routing.

Result: T2MIR improves in-context learning and outperforms baselines, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: T2MIR advances ICRL with MoE, offering a scalable solution for diverse tasks.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTPNet introduces a multi-grained target perception network for activity cliff prediction, outperforming existing methods by 18.95% RMSE improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for activity cliff prediction are limited to single binding targets, restricting their applicability. MTPNet addresses this by incorporating multi-grained protein semantic conditions.

Method: MTPNet uses a unified framework with Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS) and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance to dynamically optimize molecular representations.

Result: MTPNet achieves an 18.95% average RMSE improvement on 30 activity cliff datasets, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: MTPNet effectively captures critical interaction details, accelerating compound optimization and design in drug discovery and material science.

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

*Zhihao Tang,Chaozhuo Li,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework, synthesizes future sMRI from baseline data for real-time MCI conversion prediction, outperforming baselines by 5-12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early MCI conversion prediction faces a trade-off between immediacy (single baseline sMRI) and accuracy (longitudinal scans). MCI-Diff aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based framework with multi-task sequence reconstruction and an LLM-driven "linguistic compass" for plausible sMRI synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12% on ADNI and AIBL cohorts.

Conclusion: MCI-Diff achieves real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance by synthesizing clinically plausible future sMRI representations.

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

*Yuxuan Yue,Zukang Xu,Zhihang Yuan,Dawei Yang,Jianglong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCDVQ decouples vector quantization into direction and magnitude, improving accuracy for LLMs at 2-bit levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQ methods quantize vectors in a coupled manner, but direction is more sensitive to quantization than magnitude, leading to accuracy drops.

Method: PCDVQ decouples vectors into polar coordinates (direction and magnitude) and optimizes codebooks for each.

Result: PCDVQ achieves at least 1.5% higher zero-shot accuracy than baselines at 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: PCDVQ provides a more accurate and efficient VQ framework for compressing LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

*Zikang Liu,Tongtian Yue,Yepeng Tang,Longteng Guo,Junxian Cai,Qingbin Liu,Xi Chen,Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper improves GRPO by eliminating redundant prefix computations, maintaining performance while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's computational inefficiency with long shared prefixes limits scalability in long-context learning.

Method: Prefix Grouper restructures self-attention to encode shared prefixes once, preserving differentiability and compatibility.

Result: Empirical results show Prefix Grouper matches GRPO's performance while cutting computational costs.

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper is a plug-and-play solution for scalable GRPO training, enabling larger group sizes and tasks.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now
available at https://github.com/johncaged/PrefixGrouper

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies antithetic initial noise in diffusion models, showing it yields negatively correlated samples. This enables applications like enhancing image diversity and improving uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the effects of antithetic initial noise in diffusion models and leverage its properties for practical applications.

Method: Pairing initial noise with its negation, combining experiments and theoretical analysis, and extending to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator.

Result: Strongly negatively correlated samples, improved image diversity without quality loss, and sharper uncertainty quantification (e.g., 90% narrower confidence intervals).

Conclusion: The framework is training-free, model-agnostic, and efficient, offering practical benefits for diffusion models.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces lip-rcp, a method combining Lipschitz-bounded networks with robust conformal prediction to efficiently provide precise prediction sets under adversarial attacks, outperforming existing methods in scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical conformal prediction lacks robustness under adversarial attacks, and existing robust methods are computationally impractical for large-scale problems.

Method: The proposed lip-rcp method leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to estimate robust CP sets efficiently, combined with 1-Lipschitz robust networks.

Result: lip-rcp outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robust CP set size and computational efficiency, especially in large-scale scenarios like ImageNet.

Conclusion: The lip-rcp method bridges the gap between robustness and efficiency, offering practical deployment in real-life adversarial settings while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an embedded system for monitoring reusable packages using a deep learning model to classify package states, achieving high precision and reduced power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Package monitoring is crucial for operational efficiency and ecological sustainability, requiring a system with a lifespan matching reusable packages.

Method: The approach uses a 1D CNN for classifying accelerometer data, with data augmentation (SMOTE and ADASYN) to address imbalance, and model compression for efficiency.

Result: The model achieves 94.54% and 95.83% precision for two classes, with a fourfold size reduction and 316 mW power consumption during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively monitors package states with high accuracy and low power, suitable for long-term industrial use.

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel dynamic health indicator (HI) for rolling bearings is proposed, using an unsupervised framework to capture temporal dependencies and degradation trends without expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HI methods rely on expert knowledge and fail to capture dynamic degradation processes, limiting their effectiveness for prognostics.

Method: An unsupervised framework with a skip-connection-based autoencoder extracts degradation features, followed by an HI-generating module with temporal dependence modeling.

Result: The proposed HI outperforms comparison methods on bearing datasets, showing superior degradation trend representation and prognostics.

Conclusion: The dynamic HI effectively models degradation processes and enhances prognostic accuracy, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

TL;DR: UniPTMs is a unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction, featuring a dual-path architecture and advanced fusion techniques, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization in PTM prediction.

Method: Uses a 'Master-Slave' dual-path architecture with BGCA, LDFN, MACP, BHGFN, and HDWF mechanisms, plus a Hierarchical Contrastive loss function.

Result: Achieves 3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP improvements over state-of-the-art models across five PTM types.

Conclusion: UniPTMs successfully transcends single-type prediction paradigms and offers a lightweight variant, UniPTMs-mini, balancing complexity and performance.

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

TL;DR: DoSAC, a causal RL method, corrects hidden confounding in policy learning using backdoor adjustment, outperforming baselines in confounded settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden confounders bias RL policy learning, leading to suboptimal behavior. Most RL methods ignore this, relying on statistical associations.

Method: DoSAC extends SAC with causal intervention via backdoor adjustment, using a Backdoor Reconstructor to infer pseudo-past variables for adjustment.

Result: Empirical results show DoSAC outperforms baselines in confounded settings, improving robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Conclusion: DoSAC effectively addresses hidden confounding in RL, offering a principled solution for causal policy learning.

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

### [32] [Training Dynamics Underlying Language Model Scaling Laws: Loss Deceleration and Zero-Sum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05447)
*Andrei Mircea,Supriyo Chakraborty,Nima Chitsazan,Irina Rish,Ekaterina Lobacheva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scaling language models mitigates loss deceleration, attributed to zero-sum learning (ZSL), where per-example gradients oppose each other, bottlenecking progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaling improves language models, focusing on training dynamics and loss deceleration.

Method: Analyze loss curves in log-log space, identify loss deceleration, and attribute it to zero-sum learning (ZSL).

Result: Scaling decreases loss at deceleration and improves post-deceleration loss rates. ZSL causes destructive interference in gradients.

Conclusion: Loss deceleration and ZSL offer insights into scaling laws and potential improvements independent of model size.

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

*Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil,Sewoong Oh,Michael Muehlebach,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zeroth-order methods favor solutions with small trace of Hessian, indicating flat minima, supported by theoretical and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit regularization in zeroth-order optimization, particularly which solutions (flat minima) are favored, as existing theory lacks this fine-grained analysis.

Method: Uses the standard two-point estimator in zeroth-order optimization to analyze solutions with small trace of Hessian, defining flat minima as minimizers with the smallest Hessian trace among optimal solutions.

Result: Theoretical convergence rates to approximate flat minima for convex and smooth functions, with experimental validation on binary classification and language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Zeroth-order optimization implicitly favors flat minima, providing insights into its behavior in applications like black-box attacks and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

### [34] [Learning-Augmented Algorithms for MTS with Bandit Access to Multiple Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05479)
*Matei Gabriel Coşa,Marek Eliáš*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of selecting the best heuristic for Metrical Task Systems (MTS) online, where only one heuristic can be queried per step, and costs depend on previous queries. It achieves $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ regret and proves a tight lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises from needing to perform well compared to the best heuristic in MTS, despite limited query access and cost dependencies on past queries.

Method: The approach involves learning to select heuristics online, leveraging techniques from Bandit Learning against memory-bounded adversaries.

Result: The paper achieves $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ regret and establishes a tight lower bound, matching prior constructions.

Conclusion: The work provides a solution for heuristic selection in MTS with provable performance guarantees and tight bounds.

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

*Ruihua Chen,Bangyu Wu,Meng Li,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares pretraining and denormalization for neural network reparameterized FWI, finding denormalization simpler and more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of pretraining and denormalization in neural network reparameterized FWI for subsurface property inversion.

Method: Systematically compares pretraining (two-stage, model perturbation) and denormalization (direct addition to initial model) in FWI.

Result: Denormalization simplifies workflows, speeds convergence, and improves accuracy over pretraining.

Conclusion: Denormalization is preferable for neural network reparameterized FWI due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

*Tobias Würth,Niklas Freymuth,Gerhard Neumann,Luise Kärger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROBIN, a novel learned simulator, integrates Rolling Diffusion and Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks to improve accuracy and efficiency in simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based learned simulators struggle with global phenomena and error accumulation due to local message passing and direct next-step prediction.

Method: ROBIN combines Rolling Diffusion (parallelized inference) and Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (multiscale message passing) to capture local and global dynamics.

Result: ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 2D/3D solid mechanics benchmarks and reduces inference time significantly.

Conclusion: ROBIN addresses limitations of current simulators, offering improved performance and efficiency for complex physical simulations.

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

*Sima Noorani,Shayan Kiyani,George Pappas,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPQ, a framework for uncertainty quantification in black-box generative AI models using conformal prediction in a query-only setting, optimizing coverage, query budget, and informativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is critical for safe deployment of generative AI models like LLMs in high-stakes applications, but classical conformal prediction methods are limited to structured outputs.

Method: CPQ leverages the missing mass problem in statistics, with an optimal query policy based on the decay rate of missing mass and a mapping using Good-Turing estimators.

Result: Experiments on real-world tasks and LLMs demonstrate CPQ's applicability and superiority in producing informative prediction sets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CPQ effectively addresses the trade-offs in uncertainty quantification for black-box generative models, offering a novel and practical solution.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

*Alex Damian,Jason D. Lee,Joan Bruna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies efficient agnostic estimation of hidden subspaces in Gaussian Multi-index models, introducing the generative leap exponent $k^\star$ and proving sample complexity bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and efficiently estimate low-dimensional subspaces in Gaussian Multi-index models, extending prior work on generative exponents.

Method: Uses spectral U-statistics over Hermite tensors for agnostic sequential estimation, without prior knowledge of the model.

Result: Shows $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee k/2})$ sample complexity is necessary and sufficient, with examples for piecewise linear functions and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The generative leap exponent $k^\star$ effectively characterizes sample complexity, and the proposed method achieves agnostic estimation.

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

### [39] [Geometric and Physical Constraints Synergistically Enhance Neural PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05513)
*Yunfei Huang,David S. Greenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural PDE surrogates with physical and symmetry constraints on staggered grids improve accuracy and generalization, outperforming baselines in tasks like shallow water equations and turbulence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural PDE surrogates generalize poorly to new conditions and accumulate errors; physical and symmetry constraints could address this but are incompatible with staggered grids.

Method: Novel input/output layers enforce physical laws and symmetries on staggered grids, tested on shallow water equations and decaying turbulence.

Result: Symmetries and physical constraints improve accuracy across tasks, architectures, and measures, with combined constraints performing best.

Conclusion: Doubly-constrained surrogates generalize better and predict real-world phenomena like ocean currents more accurately.

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Motivation: Addressing the need for predicting multiple plausible futures in time-series forecasting, especially for ill-posed and ambiguous tasks.

Method: Adapts MCL with a multi-head neural network and WTA loss to promote prediction diversity, linking it to an implicit quantization objective.

Result: Demonstrates promising performance on synthetic and real-world time series with low computational cost.

Conclusion: TimeMCL is an effective, lightweight method for diverse time-series forecasting.

Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)
paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach
employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All
(WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained
attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous
tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting,
presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we
relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our
approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series,
demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

### [41] [On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526)
*Michal Klein,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Stephen Zhang,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow models benefit from large-scale optimal transport couplings with low entropic regularization, improving efficiency in training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training flow models without source-target pairings is challenging, and existing methods using small batches or sharp couplings are inefficient.

Method: Use large-scale Sinkhorn couplings (n ≈ 10^4) with low entropic regularization (ε) and sharded computations across GPUs.

Result: Improved performance in synthetic and image generation tasks with more efficient flows.

Conclusion: Large Sinkhorn couplings with low ε enhance flow model training and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new expressivity hierarchy for Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) based on graph spectra, proving their incompleteness and proposing a method to enhance their expressive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for evaluating SGNNs' expressive power, like k-WL and homomorphism counting, poorly align with graph spectra, limiting insights.

Method: The authors leverage eigenvalue multiplicity classification, propose an expressivity hierarchy, and adapt rotation equivariant networks to improve SGNNs.

Result: Theoretical proofs show SGNNs' incompleteness, and empirical tests on MNIST Superpixel and ZINC datasets validate the proposed method.

Conclusion: The study provides a better framework for understanding SGNNs' expressivity and offers a method to enhance their performance on simple spectrum graphs.

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Motivation: Deepfake technology poses security risks due to misinformation, but current detection methods struggle with adversarial deepfakes.

Method: A multi-factor LLM-based approach integrates facial recognition, speech transcription, and multi-agent LLM pipelines for cross-verification.

Result: The proposed method aims to effectively distinguish synthetic media from authentic content using multi-modal verification.

Conclusion: SocialDF and the multi-modal detection approach address real-world deepfake challenges on social media.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

TL;DR: Agentomics-ML is an autonomous agent-based system for ML experimentation in computational biology, outperforming existing methods in generalization and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated methods to handle heterogeneous biological datasets and improve generalization in ML models.

Method: Agentomics-ML follows predefined ML experimentation steps, uses Bash for file interactions, and incorporates reflection steps for iterative improvements.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art agent-based methods and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Agentomics-ML advances autonomous ML systems in computational biology, narrowing the gap with expert-built models.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ravan, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method, improves federated fine-tuning of LLMs by balancing parameter efficiency and model expressivity, outperforming prior methods by 2-8% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging edge-device data for LLMs via federated learning is challenging due to data and computational heterogeneity, leading to accuracy degradation in existing LoRA-based methods.

Method: Ravan reparameterizes weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads, training only core matrices and lightweight scaling factors to focus optimization on useful heads.

Result: Ravan achieves 2-8% higher test accuracy on vision and language benchmarks compared to prior parameter-efficient methods.

Conclusion: Ravan is a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning of LLMs, addressing limitations of existing LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers trained on linear functions show a transition in in-context learning (ICL) capability as task diversity increases, enabling out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions in pretraining distributions that enable ICL to generalize out-of-distribution, focusing on task diversity.

Method: Empirical investigation using transformers trained on linear functions, analyzing the impact of task diversity, model depth, and problem dimensionality.

Result: Increased task diversity leads to a transition from specialized to generalized ICL solutions, with similar behavior in nonlinear regression.

Conclusion: Task diversity is crucial for ICL generalization, and the study provides insights into the phase transition and influencing factors.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in decentralized agentic systems, such as limited bandwidth and lack of common objectives, by enabling scalable, open-ended, and collaborative learning.

Method: MOSAIC combines modular policy composition, cosine similarity estimation with Wasserstein embeddings, and asynchronous communication for knowledge sharing.

Result: MOSAIC shows greater sample efficiency, faster learning, and solves tasks unattainable by isolated learners, with emergent ideal task curricula.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning in agentic systems enhances performance at individual and collective levels, supporting continuous evolution.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

*Nien-Shao Wang,Duygu Nur Yaldiz,Yavuz Faruk Bakman,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes methods to adapt conformal prediction for subpopulation shifts, ensuring valid coverage without needing subpopulation structure knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard conformal prediction fails under distribution shifts, particularly subpopulation shifts, where test data differs from calibration data.

Method: New algorithms that scale to high-dimensional settings and adapt conformal prediction to unknown subpopulation shifts.

Result: Methods maintain coverage and control risk effectively in vision and language benchmarks, outperforming standard conformal prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques reliably handle subpopulation shifts, ensuring valid coverage in practical machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

*Yuchen Zeng,Tuan Dinh,Wonjun Kang,Andreas C Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabFlex improves TabPFN's scalability for large tabular datasets using linear attention, achieving faster processing and outperforming baselines like XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of TabPFN in handling large and complex tabular datasets efficiently.

Method: Incorporates linear attention mechanisms to replace quadratic self-attention, enhancing scalability.

Result: Achieves 2x speedup over TabPFN and 1.5x over XGBoost, handling millions of samples efficiently.

Conclusion: TabFlex is a scalable, efficient solution for large tabular datasets, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large
and complex datasets. Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of
TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

*Isha Puri,Amit Dhurandhar,Tejaswini Pedapati,Kartikeyan Shanmugam,Dennis Wei,Kush R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoFrNet, a novel neural architecture inspired by continued fractions, offers efficient training, interpretability, and universal approximation properties, outperforming interpretable models and MLPs on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap in interpretable neural architectures, the paper introduces CoFrNet to combine interpretability with strong performance.

Method: CoFrNet leverages continued fractions' properties for efficient training and interpretation, with a unique proof of universal approximation.

Result: CoFrNets accurately model synthetic functions and outperform interpretable models and MLPs on real datasets, nearing state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: CoFrNet demonstrates representational power and interpretability, making it a promising alternative to traditional neural networks.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the free-energy foundations of inverse folding models for protein stability prediction, revealing limitations in current methods and proposing improvements for better zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between amino acid preferences in inverse folding models and thermodynamic stability principles, enhancing theoretical understanding and practical prediction accuracy.

Method: Derives free-energy foundations of inverse folding models, critiques likelihood ratios as simplistic, and proposes alternative approaches for stability estimation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements in zero-shot stability prediction using simpler, refined methods.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the theoretical basis of inverse folding models and demonstrates practical enhancements for zero-shot stability prediction.

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

### [52] [FaCTR: Factorized Channel-Temporal Representation Transformers for Efficient Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05597)
*Yash Vijay,Harini Subramanyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaCTR is a lightweight spatiotemporal Transformer designed for time series forecasting, addressing the mismatch and overparameterization of traditional Transformers. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters and offers interpretability and pretraining support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with time series data due to low information density and complex dependencies. FaCTR aims to address these challenges with a structured, efficient design.

Method: FaCTR uses dynamic, symmetric cross-channel interactions via a low-rank Factorization Machine and learnable gating. It encodes static/dynamic covariates for multivariate conditioning.

Result: FaCTR outperforms baselines on 11 benchmarks, using 50x fewer parameters (~400K). It also enables interpretability and supports self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: FaCTR is a compact, versatile solution for time series forecasting, balancing performance, efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaxEnt RL enhances exploration and robustness but can mislead policy optimization in tasks requiring precise, low-entropy policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the trade-off between robustness and optimality in MaxEnt RL and its impact on performance in complex control tasks.

Method: Experiments on various control problems to demonstrate the misleading effect of entropy maximization.

Result: Shows that MaxEnt RL struggles with performance-critical tasks requiring low-entropy policies.

Conclusion: Better understanding of balancing reward design and entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

*Antonia van Betteray,Matthias Rottmann,Karsten Kahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an O(N) complexity method for computing singular values of convolutional mappings using local Fourier analysis, improving efficiency over FFT-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Singular values of convolutional mappings are useful for improving neural networks but are computationally expensive to calculate, especially for large inputs and channels.

Method: Leverages local Fourier analysis and shift invariance of convolutional operators to achieve O(N) complexity, avoiding the need for unrolling or FFT.

Result: The method is scalable and efficient, validated by numerical experiments, enabling computation of all singular values and vectors for high-dimensional mappings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a practical and efficient solution for spectral analysis of convolutional mappings, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

*Xiaohua Lu,Liubov Tupikina,Mehwish Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys methods for handling n-ary relational data, focusing on knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs, proposing a taxonomy and discussing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of knowledge graphs (losing higher-order relational details) and hypergraphs (overlooking entity roles), the paper explores hybrid approaches for better semantic modeling.

Method: The survey categorizes models into five methodological groups and three role-awareness levels, reviewing datasets and negative sampling strategies.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy is presented, highlighting methodologies and role-awareness in n-ary relational data modeling.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges to guide future research in knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GP-MoLFormer-Sim, a training-free method for guided molecular generation using a Chemical Language Model (CLM) and similarity metrics, integrated with a genetic algorithm (GA) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient molecular design while preserving similarity to target molecules or properties, crucial for drug discovery and chemical design.

Method: Leverages CLM's contextual representations to estimate molecular similarity, adjusts autoregressive sampling, and integrates with GA for optimization.

Result: GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA outperforms existing training-free baselines in molecular optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method advances understanding and control of generative mechanisms in CLMs.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a relaxed coupling problem for probability distributions, proposes a novel sampling method, and applies it to multi-draft speculative sampling and distributed lossy compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the coupling problem of probability distributions and extend the Gumbel-max sampling method for practical applications like speculative sampling and compression.

Method: Extends Gumbel-max sampling for coupling distributions, introduces a list matching lemma, and applies the method to multi-draft speculative sampling and distributed lossy compression.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in language tasks and guarantees drafter invariance. Provides significant gains in compression experiments with synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively solves the relaxed coupling problem and demonstrates practical utility in speculative sampling and compression tasks.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoQD automates behavioral descriptor generation for QD algorithms by embedding policy occupancy measures, eliminating the need for hand-crafted descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-crafted behavioral descriptors limit exploration in QD algorithms; AutoQD aims to automate this process for broader, unsupervised discovery.

Method: Uses random Fourier features to approximate MMD between policy occupancy measures, creating embeddings for behavioral descriptors.

Result: AutoQD successfully discovers diverse policies without predefined descriptors, validated in continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: AutoQD offers a scalable, domain-agnostic solution for open-ended learning and behavior discovery in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost of querying human experts while maintaining prediction accuracy in applications combining machine learning and human expertise.

Method: Develops a Bayesian framework modeling expert correlation via joint latent representation, enabling simulation-based inference and posterior distribution inference.

Result: Demonstrates significant reductions in expert query costs while maintaining high accuracy on medical classification tasks and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances cost and accuracy, proving useful in real-world applications like medical classification.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: A technique maps parameters of a large Transformer to a smaller, specialized model for task-specific efficiency, outperforming universal conditional models in image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are computationally expensive and contain broad, often irrelevant knowledge for specific tasks.

Method: Mapping parameters of a large Transformer to a smaller, specialized model to focus on task-specific knowledge.

Result: The smaller, specialized models outperform universal conditional models in image modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific parameter mapping enables efficient, high-performance smaller models.

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

TL;DR: A method for data attribution in generative models learns parameter importance weights to improve accuracy and provide fine-grained insights into training data influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat all network parameters uniformly, ignoring layer-specific information encoding, which limits attribution accuracy and granularity.

Method: Proposes learning parameter importance weights tailored for attribution, adapting to model structure without labeled data.

Result: Improves attribution accuracy in diffusion models and offers detailed insights into how outputs borrow from training data.

Conclusion: The method enhances attribution by capturing layer-specific influences, enabling better understanding of training data contributions.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAQ, a novel framework for nonuniform bitwidth allocation in LLM quantization, using Hessian-based sensitivity metrics and convex optimization to minimize quantization loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization methods use uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments, ignoring the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization noise.

Method: Proposes BAQ, which derives sensitivity metrics from a Hessian proxy, formulates bit allocation as a convex optimization problem, and provides a closed-form solution.

Result: BAQ outperforms GPTQ, achieving up to 56× lower perplexity at the same bitwidth across LLMs (125M to 30B parameters).

Conclusion: BAQ offers a theoretically grounded, efficient solution for bit allocation in quantization, with minimal overhead and significant performance gains.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this

RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and
inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective,
stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles
therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility.
Experiments demonstrate that RNE achieves promising performances in diffusion
density estimation and inference-time control tasks, including annealing,
composition of diffusion models, and reward-tilting.

*Andrey Zhmoginov,Jihwan Lee,Max Vladymyrov,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) that eliminates explicit prompts by encoding context into model weights, enabling self-specialization and efficient language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead caused by prompts in LLMs and enable models to self-specialize based on context.

Method: Proposes a modified Transformer (CGT) that maintains a contextual summary at each sequence position, dynamically updating weights based on preceding context.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on synthetic tasks and benchmarks, with improved interpretability of contextual representations.

Conclusion: The CGT model offers a novel, efficient approach to adaptable language modeling by integrating context directly into architecture.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a shift from model-centric to data-centric AI development, introducing the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (DSD) to improve model performance through high-quality training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to highlight the growing importance of data quality over model complexity in AI development, aiming to set a new standard for commercial image datasets.

Method: The method involves creating the DSD, a dataset of 10,610 high-quality, peer-ranked images with multi-tier annotations, and evaluating its impact on model performance against benchmarks.

Result: Results show quantitative improvements in model performance when trained with the DSD, demonstrating its effectiveness as a high-quality dataset.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the value of data-centric approaches and the DSD's role in advancing commercial and multimodal AI development.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

*Haoyang Jiang,Jindong Wang,Xingquan Zhu,Yi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a GNN framework to preserve high-frequency nodal signals in directed graphs using explicit difference matrices and implicit physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs struggle with high-frequency components in directed graphs, which are vital for modeling flow dynamics.

Method: Combines explicit difference matrices for directional gradients and implicit physical constraints for message consistency.

Result: Effective on real-world directed graphs like water flux and urban traffic flow networks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances GNN sensitivity to topological differences in directed graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

TL;DR: A synthetic benchmarking framework is proposed to evaluate sequence models' ability to capture diverse temporal dependencies, revealing new insights and confirming existing theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically characterize the strengths and limitations of sequence modeling architectures in handling temporal dependencies.

Method: A synthetic benchmarking framework with controllable targets, each defined by a memory function and temporal dependence parameter, is used to evaluate models.

Result: Experiments confirm theoretical insights and uncover new findings about model behavior regarding specific memory properties.

Conclusion: The framework effectively advances theoretical understanding and underscores the value of controllable targets for evaluating sequence models.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ManGO is a diffusion-based framework for offline optimization that outperforms existing methods by holistically learning design-score interdependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing complex systems is challenging due to unknown rules and costly evaluations. Conventional offline optimization methods fail beyond training data, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: ManGO learns the design-score manifold, unifying forward prediction and backward generation. It uses derivative-free guidance and adaptive inference-time scaling for conditional generation.

Result: ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including synthetic tasks, robotics, and material design.

Conclusion: ManGO's holistic approach to design-score interdependencies enables superior generalization and performance in offline optimization tasks.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (FedFMs) to enhance XR systems, addressing challenges like sensor diversity, hardware constraints, and interactivity under the SHIFT framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate the strengths of foundation models with federated learning for privacy-preserving, context-aware intelligence in XR systems.

Method: A modular architecture for FedFMs with coordination paradigms for training and aggregation, addressing XR challenges through the SHIFT dimensions.

Result: Identifies key challenges (SHIFT dimensions) and proposes metrics, datasets, and tradeoffs for developing resource-aware FedFMs in XR.

Conclusion: The vision lays groundwork for next-gen XR systems with privacy-preserving, context-aware intelligence.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

*Pavel Dolin,Weizhi Li,Gautam Dasarathy,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper advocates for statistically valid and label-efficient post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI to ensure reliability and safety, addressing current gaps in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Only 9% of FDA-registered AI healthcare tools include post-deployment surveillance, with existing methods being manual and reactive, unsuitable for dynamic clinical environments.

Method: Proposes framing data changes and model performance degradation as statistical hypothesis testing problems, ensuring rigor and reproducibility.

Result: The approach provides explicit error rate guarantees, formal inference, and aligns with regulatory needs, offering a principled foundation for monitoring.

Conclusion: Statistically grounded monitoring enhances reliability and opens new research directions for detecting and mitigating AI failures in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

*Chaofan Pan,Jiafen Liu,Yanhua Li,Linbo Xiong,Fan Min,Wei Wei,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), addressing the challenge of policy generalization across changing action spaces. It proposes the Action-Adaptive Continual Learning (AACL) framework, which decouples policy from action spaces and adaptively fine-tunes representations. A benchmark validates AACL's superiority over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Continual Learning (CL) methods assume static agent capabilities, which is unrealistic. The paper aims to address the gap by introducing CL-DC, where capabilities dynamically change, posing a challenge for policy generalization.

Method: The proposed AACL framework decouples policy from action spaces using an action representation space. For new action spaces, it adaptively fine-tunes encoder-decoder representations to balance stability and plasticity.

Result: Experiments on three environments show AACL outperforms existing methods in generalizing policies across dynamic action spaces.

Conclusion: The AACL framework effectively addresses the CL-DC challenge, demonstrating superior performance in policy generalization across changing action spaces.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

*Xiucheng Wang,Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel GAI-powered semantic communication framework using diffusion models (DMs) is proposed, with a theoretical foundation in SDEs for denoising latent semantic representations. It includes a closed-form SNR-timestep relationship and a scaling mechanism for robust performance. The LDM-based transceiver is training-free at inference, outperforming baselines in low SNR and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in semantic communication, such as noise and distribution mismatch, by leveraging generative AI (GAI) and diffusion models for robust performance.

Method: The framework uses stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model denoising, derives an SNR-timestep relationship, and employs a scaling mechanism. A VAE compresses semantics, and a pretrained DM acts as a universal denoiser.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms conventional neural-network-based baselines, especially in low SNR and distribution shifts, without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The GAI-driven framework offers a promising direction for robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems, with zero-shot generalization and modularity.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

TL;DR: CoTo is a progressive training strategy for LoRA that stochastically deactivates adapters to improve optimization and generalization, enhancing performance and compatibility with LoRA variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA often locks adapters into suboptimal minima, limiting generalization and downstream operations like merging and pruning.

Method: CoTo gradually increases adapters' activation probability during fine-tuning, encouraging balanced optimization and broader loss landscape exploration. Theoretical analysis supports its benefits.

Result: CoTo improves single-task performance, multi-task merging accuracy, pruning robustness, and reduces training overhead.

Conclusion: CoTo effectively addresses LoRA's limitations, offering a versatile and efficient solution for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

TL;DR: EEDQN combines ensembles and elastic step updates to improve DQN performance, addressing overestimation bias and sample efficiency. It outperforms baselines on MinAtar benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of how DQN improvements interact, especially multi-step and ensemble methods, motivates unifying them for better performance.

Method: Introduces Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), combining ensembles with elastic step updates to stabilize performance.

Result: EEDQN outperforms baseline DQN methods and matches/exceeds state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs on MinAtar environments.

Conclusion: Systematically combining algorithmic improvements (ensembles and multi-step methods) yields substantial gains in deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

*Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo,Guillaume Dumas,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking, delayed generalization after overfitting, can be induced by regularization (explicit or implicit) and is influenced by model depth and data selection. The ℓ₂ norm is unreliable for generalization under certain regularizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how regularization and model depth influence grokking, a phenomenon where generalization occurs after overfitting in neural networks.

Method: Analyzed gradient descent with small non-zero regularization (e.g., ℓ₁ or nuclear norm) and explored effects of over-parameterization (adding depth) and data selection.

Result: Regularization induces grokking; over-parameterization enables grokking without explicit regularization. The ℓ₂ norm is unreliable for generalization under certain conditions. Data selection can amplify grokking.

Conclusion: Grokking is controllable through regularization, model depth, and data selection, challenging traditional reliance on the ℓ₂ norm for generalization.

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned loss function for Multi-label Classification (MLC) to handle datasets with large negative data, improving performance without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative data in MLC can overwhelm learning, hindering accurate classification. Common in applications like defect detection and healthcare, assigning a separate negative class complicates learning.

Method: Derives a likelihood of any class being present using a normalized weighted geometric mean of predicted probabilities, with a regularization parameter to control absent class contributions.

Result: Experiments on SewerML, modified COCO, and ChestX-ray14 show gains of up to 6.01% in F1, 8.06% in F2, and 3.11% in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The redesigned loss function improves MLC performance by enhancing awareness of implicit positive instances, without extra parameters or computational cost.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited supervision and persistent uncertainty in non-stationary data streams.

Method: Proposes CSFA with prototype calibration for stable new-class identification and RSGS minimization for robust distribution alignment.

Result: CSFA shows superior performance in adapting to evolving semantics and distributions in open-world streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: CSFA provides a unified framework for stable adaptation in non-stationary environments, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: A lightweight 7B LLM with a JSON rubric and rank-16 LoRA adapter replaces heavyweight reward models, achieving 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench and outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and complexity of reward-model training in RLHF pipelines by leveraging a smaller, frozen LLM with minimal modifications.

Method: Augment a frozen 7B LLM with a JSON rubric and a rank-16 LoRA adapter (0.8% of parameters), enabling it to substitute heavyweight reward models.

Result: Achieves 96.2% accuracy on RewardBench, outperforms 27B-70B models, and enables a 7B actor to surpass a 70B DPO baseline (92% vs. 61.8%).

Conclusion: The method offers a cost-effective, transparent, and adaptable reward function, eliminating the offline phase and setting new benchmarks in RLHF.

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

*Zhongying Wang,Thoai D. Ngo,Hamidreza Zoraghein,Benjamin Lucas,Morteza Karimzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel LSTM framework with spatiotemporal feature SPH improves COVID-19 hospitalization forecasting, outperforming existing models during variant surges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic revealed gaps in hospitalization forecasting, especially during variant surges, necessitating more accurate models.

Method: The study introduces an LSTM framework with SPH, a spatiotemporal feature derived from Facebook's Social Connectedness Index, and uses multi-horizon ensembling.

Result: The model outperformed the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble by significant margins during Delta and Omicron surges, with SPH proving highly predictive.

Conclusion: The research advances hospitalization forecasting and highlights the value of spatiotemporal features like SPH in infectious disease modeling.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

### [80] [FlowOE: Imitation Learning with Flow Policy from Ensemble RL Experts for Optimal Execution under Heston Volatility and Concave Market Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05755)
*Yang Li,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowOE, a novel imitation learning framework using flow matching models, outperforms traditional optimal execution strategies by adapting to market conditions and refining expert actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimal execution strategies like Almgren-Chriss models are suboptimal in dynamic markets, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: FlowOE uses imitation learning with flow matching models, learning from expert strategies and refining actions via a loss function.

Result: Empirical evaluations show flowOE outperforms expert models and benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk.

Conclusion: FlowOE demonstrates practical applicability and potential for enhancing adaptive optimal execution in financial markets.

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

*Yunpeng Qing,Shuo Chen,Yixiao Chi,Shunyu Liu,Sixu Lin,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiTrajDiff introduces bidirectional trajectory diffusion for offline RL, enhancing dataset diversity by modeling both future and history trajectories, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing distribution bias in static datasets for offline RL by exploring both future and history trajectories, not just future ones.

Method: BiTrajDiff uses two independent diffusion processes: forward for future dynamics and backward for history transitions, leveraging critical states.

Result: Outperforms advanced DA methods on the D4RL benchmark, improving dataset diversity and policy learning.

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff effectively enhances offline RL by bidirectional trajectory modeling, demonstrating superior performance and broader state-space exploration.

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

*Haochuan,Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simpler models with proper preprocessing can outperform complex neural networks in cryptocurrency price forecasting, offering faster and more interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if model complexity genuinely improves short-term price forecasting or if gains come from preprocessing and feature engineering.

Method: Benchmarked models from logistic regression to deep architectures on BTC/USDT LOB data, using filtering pipelines and labeling schemes.

Result: Simpler models matched or exceeded complex networks' performance with preprocessing and tuning.

Conclusion: Data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning are key; simpler models provide better interpretability and speed.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

*Wenyu Zhu,Jianhui Wang,Bowen Gao,Yinjun Jia,Haichuan Tan,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an alignment-and-aggregation framework for virtual screening (VS) that improves accuracy on apo or predicted protein structures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VS methods rely on holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets, limiting their effectiveness in early-stage drug discovery where pocket information is often missing.

Method: The framework includes a tri-modal contrastive learning module for aligning ligand, holo pocket, and cavity representations, and a cross-attention adapter for dynamic aggregation of binding sites.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing approaches on apo structures, improving early enrichment factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19, while maintaining strong performance on holo structures.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for advancing first-in-class drug discovery, especially in scenarios lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

*Tuomas Oikarinen,Ge Yan,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies neural network unit explanation evaluation methods under a mathematical framework, compares metrics, and proposes guidelines for reliable evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and truthfulness of explanations for neural network units, which is crucial for mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Unifies existing evaluation methods mathematically, compares metrics, and introduces two sanity checks to test metric reliability.

Result: Many common metrics fail the proposed sanity checks, and the study identifies reliable evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Proposes guidelines for future evaluations and highlights reliable metrics for assessing neural network unit explanations.

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

*Yuki Takezawa,Xiaowen Jiang,Anton Rodomanov,Sebastian U. Stich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPDO, a method to reduce communication and computational overhead in decentralized optimization by relaxing subproblem accuracy and leveraging functional similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PDO methods require high-accuracy subproblem solutions, leading to computational inefficiency. The goal is to improve this.

Method: Proposes SPDO, which relaxes subproblem accuracy requirements and uses average functional similarity for faster convergence.

Result: SPDO achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SPDO is a more efficient alternative to current PDO methods, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EqCollide is an equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable object collisions, outperforming baselines with lower MSE and better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack equivariance to physical symmetries, struggle with collisions, and have limited scalability.

Method: Uses an equivariant encoder and Graph Neural Network-based Neural ODE for collision-aware message passing, with neural fields for velocity reconstruction.

Result: Achieves 24.34% to 35.82% lower rollout MSE than baselines, generalizes to more objects and longer timeframes, and remains robust to group actions.

Conclusion: EqCollide provides accurate, stable, and scalable simulations for deformable object collisions.

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

TL;DR: The paper explores ensemble learning for option pricing, comparing it to classical models for accuracy, feature extraction, and noise robustness. It introduces a novel experimental strategy and evaluation mechanism integrating financial theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage ensemble learning's strengths (flexibility, precision) for option pricing, addressing the need for high accuracy and reduced complexity in computational finance.

Method: Comparative analysis of ensemble and classical models, using a novel experimental strategy with parameter transfer and an evaluation mechanism combining scoring and weighted strategies.

Result: The study highlights ensemble learning's superior performance in accuracy and robustness, with insights into sliding window techniques and noise interactions.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning is effective for option pricing, with the proposed evaluation mechanism successfully bridging financial theory and computational methods.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

*Chuang Ma,Tomoyuki Obuchi,Toshiyuki Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores if Neural Collapse (NC) occurs in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, introducing Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC) with three key properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if NC's simple geometric structure extends to OR, deepening insights into deep neural networks' behavior.

Method: Combines the cumulative link model for OR with the Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) to analyze ONC.

Result: ONC emerges with three properties: within-class feature collapse, alignment of class means, and ordered latent variables.

Conclusion: ONC's properties are proven analytically and validated empirically, offering practical insights for OR, especially with fixed thresholds.

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

TL;DR: The paper compares PE and PH for GNNs, showing neither is more expressive. It introduces PiPE, a method combining both, which outperforms them in tasks like molecule prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of GNNs in exploiting structural information by comparing PE and PH, and proposing a superior hybrid method.

Method: Theoretical analysis of PE and PH, followed by the design of PiPE, a learnable method combining their strengths.

Result: PiPE is provably more expressive than PE and PH, showing strong performance in tasks like graph classification.

Conclusion: PiPE advances graph representation learning by unifying PE and PH, offering improved expressiveness and performance.

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

*Ngoc Bui,Menglin Yang,Runjin Chen,Leonardo Neves,Mingxuan Ju,Rex Ying,Neil Shah,Tong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hyperbolic geometry-based method for backward compatible representation learning, addressing uncertainty in old embeddings and enhancing model adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compatibility methods in Euclidean space ignore uncertainty in old embeddings and force new models to reconstruct outdated representations, limiting learning.

Method: The approach uses hyperbolic geometry, treating time as an axis for model confidence. Updated embeddings are constrained within the entailment cone of old ones, and a contrastive alignment loss adjusts weights based on uncertainty.

Result: Experiments show the method's superiority in achieving compatibility, improving model resilience and adaptability.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic approach effectively maintains generational consistency while accounting for uncertainty, advancing backward compatible representation learning.

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

*Junpeng Lin,Tian Lan,Bo Zhang,Ke Lin,Dandan Miao,Huiru He,Jiantao Ye,Chen Zhang,Yan-fu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WDAN is a wavelet-based framework for non-stationary time series forecasting, using tailored normalization for trend and fluctuation components to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary time series forecasting is difficult due to changing statistical properties. Existing methods often ignore multi-component behaviors.

Method: WDAN uses wavelet transforms to separate trends and fluctuations, applying differencing for trends and adaptive normalization for each component.

Result: WDAN improves forecasting accuracy across various benchmarks and backbone models.

Conclusion: WDAN effectively addresses non-stationarity in time series forecasting by disentangling and normalizing components.

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high evaluation costs in NAS, performance predictors are used, but their effectiveness depends on loss function choice. This study aims to comprehensively analyze these loss functions.

Method: The study categorizes loss functions into regression, ranking, and weighted types, assessing eight functions across 13 tasks in five NAS search spaces.

Result: Combining specific loss function categories improves predictor-based NAS. The findings offer practical guidance for selecting loss functions for different tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for developing loss functions in NAS performance predictors, aiding the NAS community in optimizing predictor-based methods.

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

*Hang Lv,Lianyu Hu,Mudi Jiang,Xinying Liu,Zengyou He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes the first interpretable clustering ensemble algorithm, addressing the gap in interpretability for high-stakes applications like medical and financial domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering ensemble methods lack interpretability, which is crucial for transparent decision-making in critical applications.

Method: Treats base partitions as categorical variables, constructs a decision tree in the original feature space, and uses statistical association tests to guide tree building.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods while providing interpretability.

Conclusion: Introduces the first interpretable clustering ensemble algorithm, paving the way for future research in interpretable clustering.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

*Andreas Bergmeister,Manish Krishan Lal,Stefanie Jegelka,Suvrit Sra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training using projection operators and iterative algorithms, implemented in PJAX, offers a parallelizable alternative to gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to conventional gradient-based loss minimization by reformulating training as a feasibility problem, enabling parallelism and handling non-differentiable operations.

Method: Uses projection operators and iterative projection algorithms to solve training as a feasibility problem, implemented in PJAX, a JAX-based framework.

Result: Demonstrated functionality and generality by training diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks, showing competitive performance.

Conclusion: The feasibility-seeking approach is a viable alternative to gradient-based training, with advantages in parallelism and non-differentiable operations.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

*Adrien Petralia,Philippe Charpentier,Youssef Kadhi,Themis Palpanas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NILMFormer, a Transformer-based model, improves appliance-level power consumption disaggregation by addressing data distribution drift in smart meter data, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NILM methods struggle with non-stationary data distribution in smart meter readings, impacting accuracy.

Method: NILMFormer uses subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization and timestamp-based positional encoding to handle distribution drift.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 4 real-world datasets and is deployed by EDF for customer energy monitoring.

Conclusion: NILMFormer effectively mitigates distribution drift, enhancing appliance-level power consumption insights.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

*Adrien Petralia,Paul Boniol,Philippe Charpentier,Themis Palpanas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CamAL introduces a weakly supervised method for appliance pattern localization in smart grids, outperforming fully supervised approaches with fewer labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart meter data aggregates appliance usage, making it hard to analyze. Fully supervised methods require costly labels, so a weakly supervised approach is needed.

Method: CamAL combines deep-learning classifiers with explainable classification to localize appliance patterns using only appliance presence data.

Result: CamAL outperforms weakly supervised baselines and matches fully supervised methods with fewer labels, validated on 4 real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CamAL offers a cost-effective solution for NILM, reducing the need for intrusive label collection while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

### [99] [A Driving Regime-Embedded Deep Learning Framework for Modeling Intra-Driver Heterogeneity in Multi-Scale Car-Following Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05902)
*Shirui Zhou,Jiying Yan,Junfang Tian,Tao Wang,Yongfu Li,Shiquan Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data-driven car-following framework addresses intra-driver heterogeneity by embedding discrete driving regimes into motion predictions, outperforming existing models in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing car-following models fail to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver under varying conditions, focusing instead on inter-driver differences or simplified assumptions.

Method: The framework uses a hybrid deep learning architecture (GRUs for regime classification and LSTMs for kinematic prediction) and leverages high-resolution trajectory data. Driving regimes are identified via segmentation and Dynamic Time Warping.

Result: The model reduces prediction errors (e.g., 58.47% MSE improvement for acceleration) and accurately reproduces traffic phenomena like stop-and-go waves.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures both inter- and intra-driver heterogeneity, offering improved accuracy in car-following behavior modeling.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeviceScope is an interactive tool using CamAL for detecting and localizing appliance patterns in smart meter data without needing extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart meters collect vast data, but non-experts struggle to interpret aggregated usage patterns, and ground-truth labels are scarce.

Method: Uses CamAL, a weakly supervised approach requiring only appliance existence knowledge for training.

Result: DeviceScope aids in understanding smart meter data by identifying individual appliance usage patterns.

Conclusion: The tool addresses the challenge of interpreting smart meter data efficiently with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

*Wenxuan Huo,Qiang He,Gang Zhu,Weifeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Over-PINNs improve PINNs by adding higher-order auxiliary equations via automatic differentiation, enhancing accuracy without high computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs reduce reliance on large datasets but struggle with accuracy in complex problems. Over-PINNs aim to address this limitation.

Method: Over-PINNs use automatic differentiation to generate higher-order auxiliary equations, adding them as extra loss terms for an overdetermined approach.

Result: The method improves solution accuracy significantly without substantial computational overhead, showing versatility across PDE types.

Conclusion: Over-PINNs effectively enhance PINNs' accuracy for complex PDEs, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

*Robbert Bosch,Wouter van Heeswijk,Patricia Rogetzer,Martijn Mes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning-based surrogate models, particularly XGBoost, to predict traffic congestion from road maintenance schedules, reducing computational costs compared to traditional simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road maintenance schedules can worsen traffic congestion if not planned carefully, but simulating thousands of scenarios is computationally expensive.

Method: The study frames the problem as supervised learning, using one-hot encodings, traffic features, and heuristic approximations. Various regression models are evaluated under an online learning framework.

Result: XGBoost outperforms other models, achieving an 11% MAPE and significant improvements in accuracy over alternatives. The Costliest Subset Heuristic works well with limited data.

Conclusion: Machine learning, especially XGBoost, can effectively reduce computational burdens in large-scale traffic assignment problems for maintenance planning.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-EDL improves adversarial and OOD robustness in deep learning by quantifying representational disagreement via task-preserving transformations, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often fail under adversarial or OOD inputs, leading to unreliable predictions. EDL, while efficient, is vulnerable to such inputs.

Method: C-EDL uses lightweight post-hoc transformations to generate diverse inputs, measures disagreement, and adjusts predictions to calibrate uncertainty.

Result: C-EDL reduces OOD coverage by up to 55% and adversarial coverage by up to 90%, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy.

Conclusion: C-EDL is a robust, efficient solution for uncertainty quantification in deep learning, enhancing reliability without retraining.

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

TL;DR: TabbyFlow introduces EF-VFM, a method for generating tabular data with mixed continuous and discrete features, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models like diffusion and flow matching are underutilized for tabular data, despite its real-world prevalence.

Method: Develops TabbyFlow using EF-VFM, leveraging exponential family distributions and moment matching for heterogeneous data.

Result: Outperforms baselines on tabular data benchmarks.

Conclusion: EF-VFM enables principled learning for mixed data types, advancing generative modeling for tabular data.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

*Luka Hobor,Mario Brcic,Lidija Polutnik,Ante Kapetanovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates forecasting models for brick-and-mortar retail, finding tree-based ensembles like XGBoost and LightGBM outperform neural networks in accuracy and efficiency, especially with localized modeling and non-imputed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for retailers to avoid costs from overestimation (unsold inventory) or underestimation (lost sales). It provides a competitive edge in revenue and pricing strategies.

Method: The study compares tree-based ensembles (XGBoost, LightGBM) and neural networks (N-BEATS, NHITS, Temporal Fusion Transformer) on high-resolution retail data, addressing challenges like intermittent demand and missing values.

Result: Tree-based models with localized strategies and non-imputed data achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Neural networks, despite advanced imputation, struggle with retail data irregularities.

Conclusion: Localized tree-based models are recommended for retail forecasting, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing for performance.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decomposition relies on mathematical models; deep learning offers unexplored potential for this task.

Method: Leverages Transformer architecture trained on synthetic data to decompose signals into constituent components.

Result: Achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing signals from the same distribution.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promising potential of deep learning, specifically Transformers, for 1D signal decomposition.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,
unexplored area with promising potential. This work presents a novel method for
the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-PG is a constrained reinforcement learning algorithm with global convergence guarantees, effective for both action-based and parameter-based exploration, and validated on control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sequential decision-making problems where agents must maximize return while meeting constraints, leveraging policy-based methods for continuous-control.

Method: Introduces C-PG, an exploration-agnostic algorithm with global convergence guarantees under gradient domination. Analyzes action-based (C-PGPE) and parameter-based (C-PGAE) variants.

Result: Achieves global convergence to optimal deterministic policy under specific noise models, validated empirically on constrained control tasks.

Conclusion: C-PG is effective, especially when deploying deterministic policies post-training, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

*Tianjun Yao,Haoxuan Li,Yongqiang Chen,Tongliang Liu,Le Song,Eric Xing,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunE is a pruning-based method to improve Graph Neural Networks' out-of-distribution generalization by removing spurious edges, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs suffer performance drops under distribution shifts; existing methods struggle to identify invariant subgraphs due to spurious edges.

Method: PrunE uses two regularization terms: graph size constraint and ε-probability alignment to prune spurious edges.

Result: PrunE achieves superior OOD performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PrunE effectively enhances GNNs' OOD generalization by comprehensively retaining invariant subgraphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

*Adil Hasan,Thomas Peyrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vector quantization (VQ) method for compressing diffusion models, achieving better performance than uniform scalar quantization (USQ) and setting new benchmarks for low-bit weight quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face hardware resource challenges for mass-market adoption. Current USQ methods are limited, while VQ has succeeded in LLMs, prompting its application here.

Method: The authors apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to diffusion models, focusing on low-bit weight compression and efficient inference kernels.

Result: Their approach outperforms full-precision models in metrics like sFID, FID, and ISC at W4A8 and W2A8, with FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware.

Conclusion: Vector quantization is a promising solution for efficient diffusion model inference, achieving superior performance and hardware flexibility.

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks for continuous action spaces accelerates learning but causes overestimation bias. An annealing approach mitigates this, improving performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Actor-critic methods for continuous actions rely on policy updates, leading to low sample efficiency. This study explores using the Bellman optimality operator to enhance learning.

Method: Proposes an annealing approach transitioning from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, tested with TD3 and SAC.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in locomotion and manipulation tasks, showing improved performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The annealing approach effectively balances learning acceleration and bias mitigation, enhancing actor-critic methods for continuous actions.

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

*Jacob Bamberger,Benjamin Gutteridge,Scott le Roux,Michael M. Bronstein,Xiaowen Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes long-range interactions in graph tasks, introduces a range measure for graph operators, and validates it with synthetic experiments to better evaluate datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of robustness and theoretical foundation in current empirical approaches to long-range graph tasks necessitates a more principled characterization.

Method: The authors formalize long-range interactions, introduce a range measure for graph operators, and validate it through synthetic experiments.

Result: The proposed range measure is used to evaluate common tasks and architectures, assessing their long-range capabilities.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of long-range graph problems and provides a tool for evaluating new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

*Yujia Huo,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Zhenguo Ma,Shilong Wang,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedBE, a novel federated fine-tuning framework, addresses catastrophic forgetting in LLMs by integrating adaptive transformer block expansion and dynamic trainable-block allocation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy retention and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FedFT methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting and fail to handle heterogeneous data distributions and device capabilities in federated environments.

Method: FedBE uses adaptive transformer block expansion to separate new task-specific knowledge from pre-trained representations and dynamically allocates trainable blocks based on client data and capabilities.

Result: FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention and 1.9-3.1x faster convergence without compromising downstream task accuracy.

Conclusion: FedBE effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances model generalization in federated fine-tuning, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

*Geonwoo Cho,Jaemoon Lee,Jaegyun Im,Subi Lee,Jihwan Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMPED is a new method for skill-based reinforcement learning that balances exploration and skill diversity using gradient surgery and dynamic skill selection, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to simultaneously optimize exploration and skill diversity, which are conflicting objectives in skill-based reinforcement learning.

Method: AMPED introduces gradient surgery to balance exploration and skill diversity during pretraining and a skill selector for dynamic skill choice in fine-tuning.

Result: AMPED surpasses SBRL baselines across benchmarks, demonstrating robust and generalizable skill learning.

Conclusion: Explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity is crucial, and AMPED effectively achieves this, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

### [114] [Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library for Lifelong Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05985)
*Yuheng Lei,Sitong Mao,Shunbo Zhou,Hongyuan Zhang,Xuelong Li,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMPEL is a lifelong learning method for robots that dynamically combines low-rank experts and uses coefficient replay to mitigate forgetting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current methods, which assume impractical task identifiers and restrict knowledge sharing, by enabling flexible lifelong adaptation.

Method: Progressive learning of a low-rank expert library and dynamic combination via a lightweight router, with coefficient replay for mitigating forgetting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in success rates on the LIBERO benchmark, using minimal parameters and storage.

Conclusion: DMPEL is an efficient and effective solution for lifelong robot learning, balancing forward transfer and forgetting.

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

*Yi-Chun Liao,Chieh-Lin Tsai,Yuan-Hao Chang,Camélia Slimani,Jalil Boukhobza,Tei-Wei Kuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RETENTION is a framework that reduces CAM capacity for tree-based model inference, improving space efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-based models outperform deep learning on structured data but face acceleration challenges due to high memory usage and low utilization in existing CAM designs.

Method: RETENTION introduces an iterative pruning algorithm and tree mapping scheme with novel data placement strategies to minimize memory redundancy.

Result: The framework achieves 1.46× to 207.12× better space efficiency with <3% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: RETENTION effectively reduces CAM requirements, offering a resource-efficient solution for accelerating tree-based models.

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

*Sanna Jarl,Jens Sjölund,Robert J. W. Frost,Anders Holst,Jonathan J. S. Scragg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-driving lab (SDL) using magnetron co-sputtering and ML to rapidly predict composition maps for multi-element thin films, avoiding time-consuming ex-situ analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDLs in thin film science are limited to solution-based methods, restricting access to inorganic materials. This work aims to overcome this by automating and accelerating the process using ML.

Method: The approach combines in-situ quartz-crystal microbalance sensor data, Gaussian processes (GPs), and a geometric model of deposition flux. Active learning with GPs predicts deposition rates for co-sputtering.

Result: The Bayesian active learning MacKay (BALM) method achieved the best performance, learning deposition rates in 10 experiments. Experimental verification confirmed accurate co-sputtering predictions.

Conclusion: The framework significantly increases throughput by eliminating extensive characterization, showcasing ML-guided SDLs' potential for accelerating materials discovery.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

*Shilong Tao,Zhe Feng,Haonan Sun,Zhanxing Zhu,Yunhuai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaDEEP is a deep learning-based surrogate model for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids, achieving high speed and accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers for large deformation problems face accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and existing deep learning models lack problem-specific adaptations for complex scenarios like stretch bending.

Method: LaDEEP uses a token sequence to represent partitioned regions of solids and a two-stage Transformer-based module to predict deformation.

Result: LaDEEP is five magnitudes faster than finite element methods with comparable accuracy and outperforms other deep learning baselines by 20.47%.

Conclusion: Deployed in real-world industrial systems, LaDEEP demonstrates superior performance in accuracy and efficiency for large deformation problems.

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Membership inference tests are unreliable even with relaxed definitions, as training data poisoning can degrade their performance below random chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reliability of membership inference tests under relaxed definitions and explore their vulnerability to poisoning attacks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the trade-off between test accuracy and robustness to poisoning, followed by empirical validation of a poisoning attack.

Result: Poisoning attacks can significantly degrade the performance of membership inference tests, making them unreliable.

Conclusion: Membership inference tests remain unreliable under relaxed definitions due to their vulnerability to poisoning, highlighting a need for more robust methods.

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

TL;DR: LightGTS is a lightweight general time series forecasting model that uses consistent periodical modeling and achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models are computationally heavy and inefficient for resource-constrained scenarios, prompting the need for a lightweight alternative.

Method: LightGTS employs Periodical Tokenization to extract consistent periodic patterns and Periodical Parallel Decoding to leverage historical tokens for improved forecasting.

Result: LightGTS achieves top performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in zero-shot and full-shot settings with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: LightGTS demonstrates that lightweight models can excel in general time series forecasting by leveraging inherent periodicity.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unisoma introduces an explicit Transformer-based model for multi-solid systems, outperforming implicit methods by capturing physical interactions directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with complex interactions in multi-solid systems due to implicit modeling.

Method: Unisoma uses explicit modeling with structured modules, contact modules, and adaptive interaction allocation to handle solid deformation.

Result: Unisoma achieves state-of-the-art performance on seven datasets and two complex tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling is more effective for multi-solid systems, as demonstrated by Unisoma's superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal effect estimation methods are limited by the need for interventional data, ground truth causal graphs, or strong assumptions like unconfoundedness. This restricts their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors pre-train PFNs on synthetic data from diverse causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes using observational data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate accurate causal effect estimation without knowing the causal graph. Ablation studies highlight Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across datasets.

Conclusion: Do-PFN offers a scalable and robust solution for causal effect estimation, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel test-time optimization method improves uncertainty estimation by addressing noisy classifier weights, enhancing reliability in confidence estimates and outperforming standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques like dropout fail to clearly distinguish reliable predictions due to noisy classifier weights, which affect finer-level statistics.

Method: The proposed method involves a test-time optimization approach to account for noise in classifier weights, defining a monotonic subset-selection function for better confidence estimates.

Result: The method shows superior performance in risk-based metrics (AUSE, AURC), identifies training-test distribution discrepancies, and differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves uncertainty estimation, highlights differences between CNN and ViT classifiers, and enhances reliability in confidence estimates.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

*Linda Lu,Ayush Sekhari,Karthik Sridharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'system-aware unlearning,' a relaxed definition of machine unlearning that focuses on efficiency and security against realistic attackers, proposing an algorithm for linear classification and analyzing tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning definitions are overly stringent, making efficient algorithm development difficult. The work aims to address this by proposing a more practical definition.

Method: The paper proposes a selective sampling-based approach for exact system-aware unlearning in linear classification and generalizes it for other function classes.

Result: The method provides theoretical tradeoffs between deletion capacity, accuracy, memory, and computation time, demonstrating feasibility under the new definition.

Conclusion: System-aware unlearning offers a practical alternative to the gold standard, balancing efficiency and security for realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

TL;DR: STOF is a framework optimizing Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion on GPU, achieving significant speedups in MHA computation and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works lack focus on performance optimization for sparse Transformer and ignore fusion opportunities for mixed-type operators, failing to adapt to varying sequence lengths.

Method: STOF unifies storage format and kernel implementation for multi-head attention, maps fusion schemes to compilation templates, and uses a two-stage search engine for optimal parameters.

Result: STOF achieves speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end inference compared to state-of-the-art work.

Conclusion: STOF effectively addresses performance optimization challenges in sparse Transformer through innovative masking and fusion techniques.

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-LoRA (T2L) enables dynamic adaptation of Large Language Models using natural language task descriptions, bypassing costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning for task adaptation is expensive and hyperparameter-sensitive. T2L aims to democratize foundation model specialization with minimal compute.

Method: T2L is a hypernetwork trained to generate LoRA adapters in a single forward pass, tested on 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters.

Result: T2L matches task-specific adapter performance and generalizes zero-shot to unseen tasks, compressing hundreds of LoRA instances.

Conclusion: T2L advances foundation model adaptation, offering efficient, language-based customization with low compute.

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns by replacing sensitive datasets with unlimited synthetic data, leveraging advances in machine learning.

Method: Covers paradigms like probabilistic graphical models and deep learning for synthetic data generation.

Result: Highlights progress and methodologies but also identifies privacy risks through studied attacks.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers potential but faces challenges like privacy attacks, with open problems remaining.

Abstract: Synthetic data is often positioned as a solution to replace sensitive

over the last decade, leveraging corresponding advances in machine learning and
data analytics. In this survey, we cover the key developments and the main
concepts in tabular synthetic data generation, including paradigms based on
probabilistic graphical models and on deep learning. We provide background and
motivation, before giving a technical deep-dive into the methodologies. We also
address the limitations of synthetic data, by studying attacks that seek to
retrieve information about the original sensitive data. Finally, we present
extensions and open problems in this area.

### [127] [Towards Lifecycle Unlearning Commitment Management: Measuring Sample-level Unlearning Completeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06112)
*Cheng-Long Wang,Qi Li,Zihang Xiang,Yinzhi Cao,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM) framework to assess machine unlearning, addressing limitations of existing methods like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). IAM quantifies unlearning completeness efficiently and scales to large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over data privacy and security necessitate effective machine unlearning methods. Existing techniques like MIAs are computationally expensive and lack granularity for approximate unlearning.

Method: IAM interpolates the model's generalization-fitting behavior gap to quantify unlearning completeness. It uses one pre-trained shadow model for scalability.

Result: IAM performs well in binary inclusion tests and correlates highly with approximate unlearning. It reveals risks of over- and under-unlearning in existing algorithms.

Conclusion: IAM provides a scalable, efficient solution for unlearning inference, highlighting the need for safeguards in approximate unlearning systems.

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irrelevant features in high-dimensional data can obscure meaningful clustering structures, necessitating effective unsupervised feature selection methods.

Method: Proposes Minkowski weighted $k$-means++ for centroid initialization and two feature selection algorithms (FS-MWK++ and SFS-MWK++) leveraging feature relevance estimates.

Result: The methods outperform existing alternatives, supported by theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively identifies stable and informative features, enhancing clustering performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing
alternatives.

TL;DR: Proposes flow attention for GNNs to adhere to Kirchhoff's first law, improving performance on flow-related graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs ignore conservation laws in flow-based graphs, limiting performance.

Method: Introduces flow attention, adapting graph attention to satisfy Kirchhoff's first law.

Result: Flow attention outperforms standard attention on flow graph datasets (circuits, power grids) in classification and regression.

Conclusion: Flow attention enhances GNN performance by incorporating physical conservation laws.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

### [131] [Gradient Similarity Surgery in Multi-Task Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06130)
*Thomas Borsani,Andrea Rosani,Giuseppe Nicosia,Giuseppe Di Fatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method for multi-task deep learning, addressing conflicting gradients by using similarity-aware momentum and gradient equalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning (MTL) faces challenges with conflicting gradients during backpropagation, which can degrade training. The paper aims to improve convergence and stability.

Method: Proposes SAM-GS, a gradient surgery method that adjusts gradients using similarity measures and modulates first-order momentum.

Result: SAM-GS shows effectiveness in synthetic problems and MTL benchmarks, improving gradient aggregation.

Conclusion: SAM-GS successfully regularizes gradient conflicts in multi-task deep learning, enhancing optimization.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Table-r1, a two-stage program-based table reasoning method for small language models (SLMs), improves accuracy by 15% over LLaMA-8B and competes with large LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of small language models (SLMs) in table reasoning (TR), particularly in numerical reasoning and layout heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes Table-r1: Stage 1 uses self-supervised Layout Transformation Inference for layout generalization; Stage 2 employs a mix-paradigm Group Relative Policy Optimization for consistent reasoning with fallback to text-based TR.

Result: Outperforms SLM-based methods by 15% accuracy on four benchmarks, achieving performance close to large LMs.

Conclusion: Table-r1 effectively bridges the gap between SLMs and LLMs in table reasoning, demonstrating robustness and consistency.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Motivation: To ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO methods by providing a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework.

Method: Proposes carps, a lightweight framework integrating optimizers and benchmark tasks, with an analysis pipeline and a method to select representative task subsets using star discrepancy minimization.

Result: Offers 3,336 tasks from 5 benchmark collections and 28 optimizer variants, with initial subsets of 10-30 tasks per type and baseline results for future comparisons.

Conclusion: carps advances HPO evaluation standardization and provides a scalable, efficient tool for method development and comparison.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of solving time-dependent parametric PDEs with uncertain or incomplete data, particularly for generalization across diverse physical parameters and dynamics.

Method: ENMA employs a generative masked autoregressive transformer with flow matching loss, encoding irregular spatial observations into uniform latent representations via attention and spatio-temporal convolutional encoder.

Result: ENMA enables robust and adaptable generalization to new PDE regimes and supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Conclusion: ENMA provides a powerful framework for generative modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics, enhancing generalization and adaptability in PDE solving.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) create a feedback loop with humans, reinforcing existing beliefs and reducing diversity, supported by simulations and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of LLMs on human beliefs, particularly how they may entrench existing values and reduce diversity, resembling an echo chamber.

Method: Formalizes the hypothesis and tests it using agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data.

Result: Finds sudden, sustained drops in diversity after new GPT iterations, supporting the feedback loop hypothesis.

Conclusion: The human-AI feedback loop in LLMs can reinforce existing beliefs, potentially locking in false ones and reducing diversity.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical foundations of self-attention and its role in learning interactions, especially in diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Analyzes self-attention through interacting entities, validates with experiments, and introduces HyperFeatureAttention and HyperAttention modules.

Result: Self-attention efficiently learns and generalizes pairwise interactions, even out-of-distribution. New modules extend to feature-level and multi-entity interactions.

Conclusion: Self-attention is a powerful interaction learner, and the proposed modules enhance its capability for complex dependencies.

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in modeling and controlling PDE-governed single-phase flows under transient conditions motivate the extension of the PINC framework from ODEs to PDEs.

Method: The PINC model for PDEs uses a two-stage neural network (steady-state and transient) and simplifies spatial dimensionality for efficient training, enabling MPC-based control.

Result: Numerical experiments show PINC accurately represents flow dynamics without labeled data, enabling real-time control and eliminating the need for iterative solvers.

Conclusion: PINC is a promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization, efficiently approximating PDE solutions without labeled data or iterative methods.

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: ICU-TSB is a benchmark for evaluating patient stratification using temporal EHR data, comparing methods like LSTM and GRU to rediscover clinically meaningful cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized medicine by leveraging ICU EHR data for patient stratification.

Method: Introduces ICU-TSB, a hierarchical evaluation framework using disease taxonomies, and compares statistical methods and recurrent neural networks (LSTM, GRU) for patient representation learning.

Result: Temporal representation learning can identify clinically meaningful cohorts, though challenging (v-measure 0.46 at top taxonomy level, 0.40 at lowest).

Conclusion: ICU-TSB provides a reproducible benchmark for temporal patient stratification, aiding personalized medicine advancements.

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores conservation laws in gradient flow dynamics for modern architectures like convolutional ResNets and Transformers, extending beyond shallow ReLU/linear networks. It identifies conservation laws for attention layers and residual blocks, introduces parameter-subset-dependent laws, and examines their persistence under discrete optimization like SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding conservation laws for practical architectures beyond shallow networks, focusing on convolutional ResNets and Transformers.

Method: Derives and analyzes conservation laws for modern architectures, starting with basic building blocks (ReLU/linear networks, attention layers, residual blocks), then introduces parameter-subset-dependent laws and tests their persistence under SGD.

Result: Identifies conservation laws for attention layers and residual blocks, shows skip connections don't alter laws, and demonstrates how subset-dependent laws can be analyzed in isolation.

Conclusion: The study extends conservation law understanding to practical architectures and shows their relevance in discrete optimization, providing insights for modern deep learning.

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

*Elie Kadoche,Pascal Bianchi,Florence Carton,Philippe Ciblat,Damien Ernst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning method for wake steering in wind farms improves energy production by optimizing turbine yaw angles under time-varying wind conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wake effects between turbines reduce energy production; current methods are limited to static conditions or small farms.

Method: Uses graph attention networks and multi-head self-attention blocks with a novel reward function and training strategy.

Result: Achieves 14% higher energy production with 10x fewer training steps than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The first robust deep reinforcement learning wake steering controller for time-varying conditions.

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in

### [142] [Model-Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06212)
*Ali Azizpour,Nicolas Zilberstein,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGCL is a model-driven graph contrastive learning framework that uses graphons to guide data-adaptive augmentations, improving performance by leveraging the underlying generative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCL methods rely on heuristic augmentations not tailored to data distribution, ignoring similarities among graphs from the same generative model. MGCL addresses this by incorporating graphons.

Method: MGCL estimates graphons from observed data to inform augmentation processes and clusters datasets for graph-level tasks, ensuring contrastive pairs reflect shared semantics.

Result: MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the benefits of integrating generative models into GCL.

Conclusion: Incorporating graphons into GCL enables principled, data-adaptive augmentations, leading to superior performance in self-supervised graph representation learning.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT), a method to reduce error accumulation in autoregressive models by iteratively revisiting and replacing past tokens, improving performance by ~10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from error accumulation due to fixed left-to-right token generation, limiting their accuracy.

Method: Introduces RPT, which revisits and replaces tokens in a window of previously generated text, maintaining next-token-prediction quality and speed.

Result: Fine-tuning an 8B parameter model with RPT for 100B tokens yielded ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPT effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive models, enhancing performance without compromising speed or quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

*Mohammad Jalali,Bahar Dibaei Nia,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPEC, a framework for interpretably comparing and aligning feature embeddings by analyzing clustering mismatches using kernel matrices and eigendecomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings focus on numerical performance, lacking interpretability. The authors aim to provide a method for identifying and analyzing clustering differences between embeddings.

Method: The SPEC framework compares embeddings by examining kernel matrices and using eigendecomposition to detect clustering mismatches. It includes a scalable implementation and an optimization problem to align embeddings.

Result: SPEC is applied to large-scale datasets (ImageNet, MS-COCO), demonstrating its effectiveness in comparing and aligning embeddings.

Conclusion: SPEC offers an interpretable and scalable solution for comparing and aligning feature embeddings, addressing limitations of current numerical comparisons.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

TL;DR: The study explores how depression affects neural responses to emotional and self-referential stimuli using EEG, revealing disrupted processing in MDD and potential diagnostic markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the neurocognitive impact of MDD on emotional and self-referential processing, aiming to identify neural signatures for diagnosis.

Method: EEG was used to measure neural responses to self-referential affective sentences in healthy and depressed individuals, with a deep learning model analyzing the data.

Result: Significant group-level neural differences were found, with the model achieving AUCs of 0.707 (healthy vs. depressed) and 0.624 (depressed subgroups). Anterior electrodes were key contributors.

Conclusion: The study identifies stable neural signatures of depression, suggesting potential for future diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Debabrota Basu,Maxence Ernoult,Aditya Gilra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLEP extends Equilibrium Propagation (EP) to time-varying inputs, offering varied learning algorithms based on boundary conditions, with Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) as a practical and efficient special case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extending EP to time-varying inputs by generalizing its variational formulation.

Method: Developed Generalized Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), analyzing boundary conditions and deriving HEL as a practical instance.

Result: GLEP produces diverse algorithms, with HEL being the only practical one, inheriting EP's desirable properties for hardware implementation.

Conclusion: GLEP successfully extends EP to dynamic inputs, with HEL standing out as an efficient and locally implementable solution.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UNDO is a scalable method for robust LLM unlearning by distilling an unlearned model into a noised copy, balancing compute cost and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM unlearning methods are easily reverted, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Method: Proposes Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), which distills an unlearned model into a partially noised copy.

Result: UNDO matches robustness of retraining from scratch with less compute and minimal labeled data, validated on synthetic and WMDP tasks.

Conclusion: UNDO provides a practical and robust solution for capability removal in LLMs, leveraging distillation.

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FARMS, a method to mitigate bias in eigenspectrum analysis of DNN weight matrices caused by varying aspect ratios, improving model diagnosis and hyperparameter assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aspect ratio bias in eigenspectrum analysis of weight matrices affects model diagnosis and hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Proposes FARMS, which subsamples fixed-aspect-ratio submatrices to normalize weight matrices and measure heavytailness more accurately.

Result: FARMS improves eigenspectrum analysis accuracy and hyperparameter assignment across CV, SciML, and LLM domains, reducing perplexity in LLaMA-7B by 17.3%.

Conclusion: FARMS effectively addresses aspect ratio bias, enhancing the reliability of eigenspectrum-based DNN diagnostics and optimization.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: Study of Rydberg EIT in Rb vapor with inert gases, revealing pressure-dependent satellite lines and Stark effect suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of inert gases on Rydberg EIT and Stark effects in Rb vapor, relevant for spectroscopy and sensing applications.

Method: Investigating three-color Rydberg EIT in Rb vapor with Ar, Ne, and N$_2$ at varying pressures, analyzing satellite lines and Stark effects.

Result: Satellite lines appear, pressure-independent in separation but strength increases with pressure; inert gases suppress static electric fields.

Conclusion: Findings are valuable for spectroscopy, Rydberg sensing, and electric-field diagnostics in low-pressure plasmas.

Abstract: Three-color Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of
room-temperature Rb vapor in the presence of inert gases (Ar, Ne, and N$_2$) at
50~mTorr and 500~mTorr is investigated. The observed EIT lines shift and
develop blue-detuned satellite lines, dependent on inert-gas species and
pressure. The separations of the satellite from the main EIT lines are
approximately pressure-independent, while their strength increases with
inert-gas pressure. The satellite lines are attributed to hyperfine collisions
of the intermediate $5D_{3/2}$ state. Further, analyzing the Stark effect of
Rydberg levels, it is found that the inert gases suppress static electric
fields in the vapor cells, which we induce by photo-illumination of the cell
walls with an auxiliary 453-nm laser. In the work, we utilize Rydberg levels
with principal quantum numbers $n$ = 25 and 50 and angular momenta $\ell$ = 3
up to 6, excited by the EIT lasers and optional radio-frequency dressing
fields. The work is of interest in the spectroscopic study of mixed-species
warm vapors, in sensing applications of Rydberg atoms in vapor cells, and in
non-invasive electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure discharge plasma.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to online learning during Covid-19 reduced non-verbal communication, impacting education quality. Sentiment analysis can bridge this gap.

Method: Involves data preparation, feature selection, and a deep neural network model (word embedding, LSTM, attention) compared to logistic regression.

Result: The model aims to improve understanding of student feedback's emotional context, enhancing online education.

Conclusion: Sentiment analysis in LMS can bridge the student-teacher communication gap, improving online learning efficacy.

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 'human-in-the-loop' framework for Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) to analyze large qualitative datasets, combining ML/NLP with traditional Grounded Theory rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big data challenges manual qualitative analysis; integrating computational methods is necessary but raises concerns about result trustworthiness.

Method: A novel CGT framework is introduced, blending ML/NLP with human oversight to ensure credibility and robustness.

Result: The framework was tested on a Reddit dataset about gig economy tutors, demonstrating its practical value.

Conclusion: The CGT framework effectively scales qualitative analysis while maintaining methodological rigor and researcher control.

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

TL;DR: The paper explores sequel-aware embeddings in graph-based recommendation systems, showing improved performance by incorporating temporal item sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored efficacy of temporal item sequences in recommendations compared to item-item correlations.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) and compares them with other sequential learning algorithms.

Result: HSAL-GNNs outperform or match other methods, demonstrating the value of sequence information in recommendations.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal item sequences significantly enhances recommendation performance.

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current match-action table (MAT) abstraction misaligns with DL inference, causing accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality.

Method: Pegasus uses Partition, Map, SumReduce primitives and Primitive Fusion for scalability, along with full precision weights and fixed-point activations.

Result: Pegasus supports various DL models (MLP, RNN, CNN, AutoEncoder) with 22.8% higher accuracy, 248x larger model size, and 212x larger input scale.

Conclusion: Pegasus effectively addresses MAT limitations, enabling efficient DL inference on the dataplane.

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

TL;DR: The paper explores autoregressive models for image data, proposing an improved ConvNADE for real-valued and color images, and shows that low-discrepancy pixel patches enhance reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image reconstruction by predicting unobserved parts from small pixel subsets, addressing the impact of pixel processing order on model performance.

Method: A generalized, efficient version of ConvNADE for real-valued and color images, tested with random and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo theory.

Result: Low-discrepancy pixel patches reduce test loss and yield more realistic reconstructions compared to random patches.

Conclusion: Optimizing pixel selection (e.g., low-discrepancy sequences) improves autoregressive model performance for image reconstruction.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histology and MSI have different image processes, making registration challenging. Combining them enhances precision in identifying tissue changes.

Method: Uses a pix2pix model to synthesize histological images from MSI, enabling unimodal registration.

Result: Preliminary results show improved synthetic histology images with higher mutual information (+0.924) and SSIM (+0.419) compared to a U-Net baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses registration challenges between histology and MSI, with promising results and publicly available code.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation

TL;DR: LinGuinE is an automated method for longitudinal lung tumour segmentation, improving Dice scores by over 20% on test datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few solutions exist for automated longitudinal tumour segmentation, which is crucial for tracking chemotherapy response in lung cancer.

Method: LinGuinE uses radiologist-provided initial tumour points, propagates them via rigid registration, and employs a click validity classifier to create segmentations in new time points.

Result: LinGuinE improves Dice scores by over 20% (p<0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies on clinical and public datasets.

Conclusion: LinGuinE is effective for automated longitudinal lung tumour segmentation, with flexibility in choosing any starting time point.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing toxicity and instability in lead-based perovskite solar cells by exploring complex perovskite materials efficiently.

Method: Uses clustering for a diverse initial dataset and a two-stage active learning approach to improve ML-based structure relaxations.

Result: Reduces DFT calculations by 20-50%, achieves 0.5 meV/atom error in CsSn(Cl/Br/I)₃ relaxations.

Conclusion: The scheme is robust and accurate, enabling efficient exploration of complex perovskite materials.

Abstract: Lead-based perovskite solar cells have reached high efficiencies, but
toxicity and lack of stability hinder their wide-scale adoption. These issues
have been partially addressed through compositional engineering of perovskite
materials, but the vast complexity of the perovskite materials space poses a
significant obstacle to exploration. We previously demonstrated how machine
learning (ML) can accelerate property predictions for the CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$
perovskite alloy. However, the substantial computational demand of density
functional theory (DFT) calculations required for model training prevents
applications to more complex materials. Here, we introduce a data-efficient
scheme to facilitate model training, validated initially on CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$
data and extended to the ternary alloy CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$. Our approach employs
clustering to construct a compact yet diverse initial dataset of atomic
structures. We then apply a two-stage active learning approach to first improve
the reliability of the ML-based structure relaxations and then refine accuracy
near equilibrium structures. Tests for CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ demonstrate that our
scheme reduces the number of required DFT calculations during the different
parts of our proposed model training method by up to 20% and 50%. The fitted
model for CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$ is robust and highly accurate, evidenced by the
convergence of all ML-based structure relaxations in our tests and an average
relaxation error of only 0.5 meV/atom.

*Fuat Can Beylunioglu,Mehrdad Pirnia,P. Robert Duimering*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A partially-supervised NN (PSNN) architecture is proposed to solve multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) more accurately and efficiently than traditional deep NN methods, even with smaller training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep NN applications to mp-QP fail to provide optimal and feasible predictions, despite large datasets. This study aims to improve accuracy and efficiency by leveraging the mathematical structure of the problem.

Method: The PSNN architecture directly represents the global solution function's mathematical structure, deriving weights from optimization properties. It is tested on energy systems (DC optimal power flow).

Result: PSNN outperforms generic NN models and commercial solvers in accuracy and speed, even with less data and extreme test cases. It provides optimal solutions within seconds for large-scale problems.

Conclusion: PSNN offers a faster, more accurate alternative to traditional solvers and generic NNs for mp-QP, making it suitable for simulations and long-term planning in energy management.

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

### [159] [Policy Optimization for Continuous-time Linear-Quadratic Graphon Mean Field Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05894)
*Philipp Plank,Yufei Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A policy optimization framework for linear-quadratic Graphon Mean Field Games (GMFGs) is proposed, enabling scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning with heterogeneous players. The method uses affine policy parameterization and a bilevel optimization algorithm, proving convergence to Nash equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability challenges in large-population dynamic games by leveraging GMFGs to approximate heterogeneous player interactions.

Method: Proposes a policy optimization framework with affine policy parameterization (shared slope, player-specific intercepts) and a bilevel algorithm alternating policy gradient and distribution updates.

Result: Proves linear convergence of policy gradients and global convergence to Nash equilibrium, supported by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively scales multi-agent reinforcement learning in GMFGs, with robust convergence under varied conditions.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

### [160] [Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125)
*Hamza Fawzi,Omar Fawzi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores two linear programming hierarchies for computing expectation values in spin systems, proving fast convergence under specific conditions and offering rigorous bounds without prior convergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently compute expectation values under the Gibbs distribution of spin systems, addressing limitations of Monte Carlo methods by providing rigorous bounds.

Method: Two hierarchies: one based on local spin flip equalities (from high-energy physics) and another on a Markov chain. Both analyzed for convergence under spatial mixing or rapid mixing conditions.

Result: Both hierarchies yield quasi-polynomial-sized linear programs for ε-approximation, applicable to systems embeddable in low-dimensional grids.

Conclusion: The approach provides rigorous bounds and avoids reliance on prior convergence analysis, offering advantages over Monte Carlo methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm to translate neural networks into piecewise linear functions for interpretability, analyzing the complexity and applicability of the resulting representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretability of neural networks by representing them as piecewise linear functions, enabling clearer understanding and further logical or lattice-based analysis.

Method: An algorithm is developed to translate feedforward neural networks with ReLU and truncated identity activations into regional piecewise linear representations.

Result: Empirical analysis shows the complexity of regional representations varies with network size, and the algorithm's outputs often meet the property needed for lattice/logical representations.

Conclusion: The method provides a viable path to interpretable neural network representations, though further investigation is needed for broader applicability.

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

TL;DR: The paper explores plastic deformation in crystalline sheets under large uniaxial stretching, revealing intermittent shear deformations and fracture patterns, with implications for 2D crystal engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the study of elastic response to the plastic regime and understand irreversible instabilities in 2D crystals under large stretching.

Method: Systematic investigation of crystalline sheets with varying geometry, analyzing fracture processes, lattice tilting, displacement fields, and dislocation emergence.

Result: Identified two fracture categories (defect-free and defective), observed shear-driven lattice tilting, vortex structures, and dislocations, and discussed noise and initial orientation effects.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of plastic instabilities in 2D crystals and suggests practical applications in engineering covalently bonded systems.

Abstract: The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation
in the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we
extend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring
the adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical
stretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to
the complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically,
systematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that
the fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective
categories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the
characteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large
stretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice
tilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of
mobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise
and initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched
crystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding
of the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals
under large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications
in the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of
covalently bonded particulate systems.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper explores tensor trains (TTs) for compressing and simulating turbulent fluids, validating their efficiency in fully developed turbulent regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turbulent fluid simulations are computationally intensive, and TTs offer a promising solution with scalable parameter efficiency, but their performance in high-complexity flows (high Reynolds numbers) is unclear.

Method: The study analyzes TT compression of turbulent snapshots, develops a TT solver for 3D Navier-Stokes equations, and creates a TT algorithm for synthetic turbulence generation.

Result: TTs efficiently compress and simulate turbulent flows with polylogarithmic parameter scaling, maintaining key turbulence signatures.

Conclusion: TTs provide an effective, quantum-inspired approach for turbulent fluid simulations, even in high-complexity regimes.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life
applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in
engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their
intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial
resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows
on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of
the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how
the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows,
measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been
extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this
gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress,
simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D.
Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression
of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum
and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time
evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT
algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of
turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling
polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our
findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT
description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their
computational treatment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for wheeled-legged robots integrates dynamic reward shaping and curriculum learning to achieve robust fall recovery, reducing joint torque and improving stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for fall recovery in wheeled-legged robots often fail due to reliance on preplanned motions or sparse rewards, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: The framework combines Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping, curriculum learning, and an asymmetric actor-critic architecture with noise-injected observations for robustness.

Result: The method reduces joint torque by 15.8% and 26.2%, achieves recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%, and enhances stabilization through energy transfer.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency in fall recovery for wheeled-legged robots, with high success rates and reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BEAST is a novel action tokenizer using B-splines for compact, smooth action sequences, compatible with various models and benchmarks, reducing costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action tokenizers require separate training and produce non-uniform tokens, leading to inefficiencies and discontinuities. BEAST addresses these limitations.

Method: BEAST encodes action sequences into uniform-length tokens using B-splines, eliminating tokenizer training and enabling parallel decoding. It integrates with VAE, Transformer, and Florence-2 models.

Result: BEAST reduces computational costs, generates smooth control signals, and achieves competitive success rates across 166 simulated and 8 real-world tasks.

Conclusion: BEAST is a scalable, efficient, and high-performing action tokenizer suitable for continuous control tasks and integration with large pretrained models.

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem for autonomous robotic systems, addressing gaps in existing methods, and proposes a fast, efficient solution using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robotic systems in remote, dynamic environments need rapid replanning without relying on fragile communication links, but existing methods lack adaptability, cooperation, and practical deployment considerations.

Method: The authors define a new variant of the multiple TSP problem and develop an encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models for efficient replanning.

Result: The proposed replanner maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 solver 90% of the time while running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: This work enhances resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems by enabling fast, cooperative replanning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric assembly of broken parts is a challenging robotic task requiring recognition of geometric cues and bimanual manipulation, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: The approach leverages point-level affordance learning, focusing on bimanual collaboration and long-horizon action sequences, and introduces a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms previous affordance-based and imitation-based techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances geometric assembly by addressing evaluation ambiguity and improving performance.

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: ODE-GS unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ODEs to forecast dynamic 3D scenes beyond training time, outperforming existing methods in extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural rendering systems fail to predict future scenes due to time embedding limitations. ODE-GS addresses this by decoupling time dependency and leveraging latent ODEs for continuous-time dynamics.

Method: ODE-GS combines a time-conditioned deformation model with a Transformer encoder and neural ODE for latent state evolution. It uses numerical integration for smooth future predictions and includes a variational objective and regularizer.

Result: ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and reducing LPIPS by half on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks.

Conclusion: ODE-GS demonstrates that continuous-time latent dynamics enable photorealistic future predictions of complex 3D scenes, offering a practical and powerful solution.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Result: Achieves a 21% average speed-up in query latency on the JOB-CEB benchmark.

Conclusion: LLM-powered embeddings can enhance query performance, offering a training-free approach for optimizer guidance.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It
is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the
space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise the
Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$. We consider several partial
differential equations (PDEs) whose solution is a minimiser of the
Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$ and connect them to well-known Monte
Carlo algorithms. We focus in particular on PDEs obtained by considering the
Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry over the space of probabilities and show that
these lead to a natural implementation using importance sampling and sequential
Monte Carlo. We propose a novel algorithm to approximate the
Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao flow of the Kullback--Leibler divergence which
empirically outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
  We study tempered versions of these PDEs obtained by replacing the target
distribution with a geometric mixture of initial and target distribution and
show that these do not lead to a convergence speed up.

### [173] [Adaptive stable distribution and Hurst exponent by method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05354)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a moving estimator for nonstationary time series, using exponentially weighted local log-likelihood to adaptively estimate parameters like absolute central moments and alpha-Stable distribution parameters, applied to financial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH by proposing a more agnostic method for nonstationary time series.

Method: Uses a moving estimator with exponentially weakening weights for local log-likelihood optimization, updated via EMA for parameters like absolute central moments and alpha-Stable distribution.

Result: Demonstrates adaptive estimation of parameters (e.g., center, scale, and alpha) in financial data (DJIA), evaluating market stability and extreme event probabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts to nonstationary data, providing continuous parameter evolution and insights into market stability.

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: DART-Vetter is a compact, open-source Deep Learning model for distinguishing planetary candidates from false positives in transit surveys like Kepler and TESS, achieving 91% recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness in identifying planetary candidates by leveraging data from multiple transit surveys (Kepler, TESS, PLATO) and simplifying the vetting process.

Method: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process folded light curves, featuring a simpler architecture than existing models.

Result: Achieves 91% recall on TESS and Kepler data, outperforming Exominer and Astronet-Triage, and generalizes well for specific TCEs.

Conclusion: DART-Vetter is effective for automating triaging and assisting human vetters, with strong performance and simplicity.

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

*Lianhao Zhou,Hongyi Ling,Keqiang Yan,Kaiji Zhao,Xiaoning Qian,Raymundo Arróyave,Xiaofeng Qian,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPPS is a framework for autonomous materials discovery, integrating workflow planning, physics, and scientist feedback, achieving significant improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomy in language agents for materials discovery by automating workflow planning and integrating physics and scientist intuition.

Method: MAPPS combines a Workflow Planner (using LLMs), a Tool Code Generator (for executable Python code), and a Scientific Mediator (for feedback and robustness).

Result: Achieves a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates on the MP-20 dataset compared to prior generative models.

Conclusion: MAPPS is a promising framework for flexible and reliable autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

### [176] [Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05422)
*Andrei T. Patrascu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework replaces reward-based optimization with constructive logical inference, ensuring verifiable preconditions and guaranteed validity in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning relies on probabilistic trial-and-error, leading to unsafe or invalid transitions. This work aims to provide a safer, interpretable, and logically valid alternative.

Method: Actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions. Decision-making involves constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic, ensuring verifiable preconditions. Implemented in a symbolic gridworld with logical constraints.

Result: The method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behavior, and efficient convergence with no invalid actions, outperforming Q-learning.

Conclusion: This framework offers a new direction for reinforcement learning, grounded in constructive logic and proof theory, with potential for safe planning and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

### [177] [Avoiding Death through Fear Intrinsic Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05529)
*Rodney Sanchez,Ferat Sahin,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically-inspired intrinsic reward function using a memory-augmented neural network (MANN) to deter exploration of terminal states, mimicking fear conditioning in animals. It demonstrates avoidance behaviors in a POMDP environment with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating reinforcement learning methods in environments with non-descriptive terminal states (e.g., death) by creating a biologically-inspired intrinsic reward function.

Method: The method involves designing an intrinsic reward function inspired by amygdala development, implemented via a MANN architecture. The framework is tested in the Miniworld Sidewalk environment, a POMDP with sparse rewards.

Result: The results show that the intrinsic motivation successfully deters exploration of terminal states, producing avoidance behaviors similar to fear conditioning. Adjusting the fear response threshold yields behaviors analogous to general anxiety disorders (GADs).

Conclusion: The study presents a biologically-inspired neural architecture for fear conditioning in RL, empirically demonstrating its effectiveness in solving environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

*Junjie Xing,Yeye He,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Lingjiao Chen,Dongmei Zhang,Surajit Chaudhuri,H. V. Jagadish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMTU, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs on expert-level table-related tasks, highlighting gaps in current evaluations and showing significant room for model improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for table-related tasks are limited and narrowly focused, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world challenges faced by professionals.

Method: MMTU includes over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, derived from decades of research, to assess table understanding, reasoning, and coding skills.

Result: Frontier models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60% on MMTU, indicating substantial challenges.

Conclusion: MMTU aims to drive advancements in foundation models for structured data processing by addressing current evaluation gaps.

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

*Kihyun Kim,Jiawei Zhang,Asuman Ozdaglar,Pablo A. Parrilo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel preference learning framework ensures proportional alignment of aggregate opinions with true population preferences, addressing biases in conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate bias in preference aggregation by aligning policies with the true distribution of evaluator preferences.

Method: Infers evaluator population distributions from pairwise comparisons, constructs policies adhering to social choice axioms, and introduces a soft-max relaxation for trade-offs.

Result: Validated effectiveness and scalability in tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances proportional representation and Condorcet winner selection, offering a robust solution for preference learning.

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

*Emil Biju,Shayan Talaei,Zhemin Huang,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Azalia Mirhoseini,Amin Saberi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRINT is a framework for parallelizing reasoning tasks in large models, reducing sequential token generation by up to 39% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) suffer from long inference times due to sequential chains-of-thought. SPRINT aims to enable parallelization for efficiency.

Method: SPRINT reorganizes reasoning trajectories into structured planning and parallel execution, fine-tuning LRMs on curated data to identify and parallelize subtasks.

Result: Models fine-tuned with SPRINT match performance in complex domains (e.g., mathematics) while reducing sequential tokens by ~39% for long outputs.

Conclusion: SPRINT effectively reduces inference time for LRMs by enabling parallel reasoning, with consistent improvements on out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new MCMC-based constrained sampling framework for LMs ensures constraint satisfaction, convergence to the true distribution, and efficiency, outperforming existing methods in program fuzzing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constrained-decoding methods distort model distributions, limiting diversity and validity in applications like program fuzzing.

Method: Proposes a framework using MCMC with a proposal distribution over valid outputs and Metropolis-Hastings acceptance for principled exploration.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances constraint satisfaction, convergence, and efficiency, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human values requires robust reward modeling, but current methods face challenges like causal misidentification and preference heterogeneity.

Method: The paper frames reward modeling in a causal paradigm, leveraging causal inference tools to identify assumptions and improve model robustness.

Result: Causally-inspired approaches are shown to outperform naive reward models, addressing issues like confounding and preference heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for targeted interventions and causally-informed practices to overcome limitations of observational data in reward modeling.

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaAgent is a personalized LLM agent framework with memory and action modules, outperforming baselines by aligning user preferences dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents lack flexibility for user-specific needs, prompting the development of PersonaAgent for personalized tasks.

Method: Integrates personalized memory (episodic/semantic) and action modules, using a persona prompt to align actions with user preferences via test-time optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines in personalization and scalability, demonstrating dynamic user alignment.

Conclusion: PersonaAgent shows feasibility in delivering tailored user experiences, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RefPlan is a novel Bayesian offline RL method that improves performance by unifying uncertainty modeling and model-based planning, enhancing adaptability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, and existing methods lack adaptivity due to fixed conservative policies.

Method: RefPlan uses a doubly Bayesian approach, recasting planning as Bayesian posterior estimation and updating beliefs over dynamics with real-time observations.

Result: RefPlan outperforms conservative offline RL policies, especially under high uncertainty and limited data, and adapts well to changing dynamics.

Conclusion: RefPlan enhances flexibility, generalizability, and robustness in offline RL, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

TL;DR: The paper explores gender bias in LLMs for e-commerce, focusing on product description generation, and identifies novel biases requiring specialized detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and analyze gender bias in LLMs used for e-commerce, a domain where such biases are understudied.

Method: Develops a taxonomy of gender bias in product descriptions, tests GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM, and quantifies biases.

Result: Reveals unique biases like clothing size assumptions, stereotypical feature emphasis, and persuasive language differences.

Conclusion: Highlights under-explored gender bias dimensions in e-commerce, contributing to broader AI harm frameworks like exclusionary norms and stereotyping.

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

TL;DR: TGTalker is a new framework for applying LLMs to dynamic graphs, showing competitive performance in link prediction and offering explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The application of LLMs to real-world dynamic graphs is underexplored, despite their success in static graphs.

Method: TGTalker leverages recency bias in temporal graphs, converting structural info to natural language for LLMs and using temporal neighbors for prediction.

Result: TGTalker matches or outperforms state-of-the-art TGNN models in link prediction across five real-world networks and provides textual explanations.

Conclusion: TGTalker advances temporal graph learning with LLMs, offering competitive performance and explainability, with potential for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is

the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

### [188] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses unsupervised machine learning to analyze language development in children with and without SLI, revealing distinct clusters and challenging traditional diagnostic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early identification and intervention for SLI by uncovering natural language development trajectories, as traditional methods may miss subtle patterns.

Method: Analyzed narrative samples from 1,163 children using PCA and clustering on 64 linguistic features to identify developmental trajectories.

Result: Two primary clusters emerged: high production/low SLI and limited production/high syntactic complexity/high SLI, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.

Conclusion: SLI is linked to reduced production capacity, not syntactic deficits, and unsupervised learning can refine diagnostics and interventions.

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

*John Kirchenbauer,Janny Mongkolsupawan,Yuxin Wen,Tom Goldstein,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset to study how language models memorize facts and verbatim sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing these memorization types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how language models memorize facts and verbatim sequences from training data, which is currently less understood compared to sequence memorization.

Method: A synthetic dataset of webtext-like documents about fictional events and question-answer pairs is created. Training experiments are conducted to analyze memorization processes.

Result: The synthetic data effectively differentiates between fact memorization and verbatim sequence memorization, though challenges in creating realistic fictional data are noted.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset is a valuable tool for studying memorization in language models, despite challenges in synthetic data realism.

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel curriculum learning framework (POCL) improves knowledge distillation for LLMs by progressively introducing training samples from easy to hard, enhancing stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for LLMs suffer from distribution shifts, causing issues like catastrophic forgetting and training-inference mismatch.

Method: POCL uses a difficulty measurer to rank samples and a training scheduler to introduce them progressively with rising loss temperatures.

Result: POCL consistently improves student model performance across various KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: Structured training data in KD enhances stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

TL;DR: Rel-LLM introduces a GNN-based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs, preserving database structures and outperforming text-based methods in relational deep learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based serialization of relational data for LLMs loses critical structures and is inefficient. Rel-LLM aims to address this by integrating GNNs and LLMs for better relational reasoning.

Method: Uses a GNN encoder to extract local subgraphs, creating structured relational prompts for LLMs within a RAG framework, preserving entity relationships and temporal dependencies.

Result: Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on relational deep learning tasks, offering scalable and efficient integration of LLMs with structured data.

Conclusion: Rel-LLM provides a novel and effective approach for leveraging LLMs in relational deep learning by preserving and utilizing structured data relationships.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework using knowledge graphs and LLM judges to better assess unlearning in LLMs, revealing current methods overestimate effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning methods focus on explicit fact removal, ignoring latent dependencies and non-deterministic knowledge in LLMs, leading to incomplete unlearning.

Method: Proposes a framework representing factual contexts as knowledge graphs with confidence scores and uses LLM judges for inference-based evaluation, calibrated against human judgments.

Result: Experiments show the framework provides a more realistic and rigorous unlearning assessment, revealing current strategies overestimate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves unlearning evaluation, highlighting limitations in existing methods and offering a more accurate approach.

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

*Maor Ashkenazi,Ofir Brenner,Tal Furman Shohet,Eran Treister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot method (ATC) to detect LLM-generated code by leveraging task-level conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art results without needing the generator LLM or original prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of detecting LLM-generated code impacts security, intellectual property, and academic integrity, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: The approach approximates the original task for a code snippet and evaluates token-level entropy under this approximated task conditioning (ATC).

Result: ATC outperforms benchmarks, generalizes across languages (Python, CPP, Java), and works without access to the generator LLM or prompts.

Conclusion: Task-level conditioning is crucial for detecting LLM-generated code, and ATC offers a practical, high-performing solution.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary

*Sabri Eyuboglu,Ryan Ehrlich,Simran Arora,Neel Guha,Dylan Zinsley,Emily Liu,Will Tennien,Atri Rudra,James Zou,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher Re*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Cartridges," a method to train smaller KV caches offline for large language models, reducing memory and cost compared to in-context learning (ICL). Self-study, a synthetic conversation-based training approach, outperforms naive methods and matches ICL performance with significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for grounding queries in large corpora using ICL are costly due to high memory consumption. The authors aim to reduce this cost by training smaller, reusable KV caches (Cartridges) offline.

Method: The paper introduces self-study, a training recipe where synthetic conversations about the corpus are generated, and the Cartridge is trained with a context-distillation objective. This avoids the inefficiency of naive next-token prediction.

Result: Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. They also extend the model's effective context length and allow composition without retraining.

Conclusion: Self-study-trained Cartridges offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative to ICL, with additional benefits like extended context length and composability.

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

*Anarya Ray*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Normalizing Flows to quantify and marginalize uncertainties in emulating compact binary coalescence populations, aiding astrophysical insights from gravitational wave data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic simulations of compact binary coalescences are costly, and existing emulators like normalizing flows lack uncertainty quantification, especially for sparse training data.

Method: Develops Bayesian Normalizing Flows using Bayesian neural networks to sample posterior distributions of flow parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and marginalization.

Result: Demonstrates accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification benefits for binary black hole populations formed via common envelope evolution.

Conclusion: The method enhances simulation-based inference for gravitational wave catalogs and has broader applications in GW astronomy.

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes parameter estimation in inverse problems, addressing domain-shift issues and questioning the assumption that data inversion improves parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the challenges in parameter estimation within inverse problems, particularly domain-shift and the impact of data inversion on downstream tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of domain-shift and parameter estimation, illustrated with experiments in image deblurring and medical imaging. Comparison of invertible and non-invertible processes.

Result: Identified a vulnerability in domain generalization (Double Meaning Theorem) and showed that data inversion doesn't always enhance parameter estimation.

Conclusion: The findings challenge common assumptions and aim to guide better system planning, especially in safety-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: MPS (Model Prediction Set) is a new framework for online model selection in nonstationary time series, combining conformal inference and model confidence sets to adaptively select optimal models in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical model selection methods fail in nonstationary environments, yet real-world data are rarely stationary, creating a need for adaptive solutions.

Method: MPS uses conformal inference and model confidence sets to update a confidence set of candidate models in real time, adapting to unknown nonstationarity.

Result: Simulations and real-world data show MPS reliably selects optimal models under nonstationarity and produces small, high-quality sets.

Conclusion: MPS is a versatile framework applicable to diverse problem settings, offering insights into changing dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sequential method to orient edges in a CPDAG using PANM, enabling efficient and robust causal DAG learning under nonlinear ANMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods are limited by restrictive assumptions, reliance on independence tests, or high computational costs.

Method: A sequential procedure leverages PANM to orient edges in a CPDAG, supported by a statistical test for directionality and a ranking procedure for edge evaluation.

Result: The method is computationally efficient, robust to model misspecification, and outperforms existing nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is consistent and effective for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs, validated by synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SBI is widely used but struggles with computationally expensive simulators, limiting the number of feasible simulations.

Method: Proposes leveraging multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings with multiple simulators of varying cost and fidelity.

Result: The method significantly enhances SBI accuracy under a fixed computational budget, supported by theory and experiments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the computational limitations of neural SBI, improving performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biologically-plausible neural network for principal subspace projection, analyzes its convergence across three time scales, and validates the approach numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a formal convergence analysis for a biologically-plausible neural network derived from a similarity matching cost function, addressing gaps in prior work.

Method: A continuous-time neural network (similarity matching network) with three coupled dynamics (neural, lateral synaptic, feedforward synaptic) at different time scales, using Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules. Convergence is analyzed using a multilevel optimization framework.

Result: Proves convergence at each time scale: exponential convergence for fast and intermediate scales, and almost sure convergence to global minima for the slow scale. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results.

Conclusion: The framework successfully achieves convergence in a biologically-plausible setting, validated by theory and experiments, advancing the understanding of normative dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

TL;DR: TESS data analyzed for eclipsing binaries using a neural network, resulting in a catalog of 10,001 validated systems, including 7,936 new discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage TESS's capability for detecting variable stars, particularly eclipsing binaries, to study stellar formation and evolution.

Method: Combined neural network analysis of TESS Full-Frame Image data (Sectors 1-82) with automated methods and citizen scientist manual inspection.

Result: Identified 10,001 validated eclipsing binaries (7,936 new) and provided a list of ~900,000 unvetted candidates.

Conclusion: The catalog and methods enhance understanding of eclipsing binaries and offer resources for future astrophysical studies.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

### [203] [Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674)
*Negin Golrezaei,Sourav Sahoo*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces safe bidding strategies for repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions, ensuring RoI constraints. It presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning optimal safe strategies with sublinear regret and evaluates their performance against stronger benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of a value-maximizing buyer adhering to RoI constraints in repeated auctions, ensuring practical and theoretical appeal.

Method: Develops safe bidding strategies and a polynomial-time algorithm to learn optimal strategies, tested against clairvoyant benchmarks.

Result: Safe strategies achieve sublinear regret and outperform theoretical bounds in real-world auction experiments.

Conclusion: Safe strategies are practical and effective, offering strong performance in repeated auctions.

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

### [204] [Learning-Augmented Hierarchical Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05495)
*Vladimir Braverman,Jon C. Ergun,Chen Wang,Samson Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a splitting oracle to improve hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms, achieving better approximation guarantees for Dasgupta and Moseley-Wang objectives despite known hardness barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the hardness of approximation in HC by leveraging auxiliary information from a splitting oracle, enabling more efficient and accurate clustering.

Method: Utilize a splitting oracle to identify vertex splits in an optimal tree, leading to polynomial-time and near-linear time algorithms for HC.

Result: Achieved O(1)-approximation for Dasgupta's objective and (1-o(1))-approximation for Moseley-Wang's objective, outperforming standard HC approaches.

Conclusion: The splitting oracle enables HC algorithms to bypass hardness constraints, with applications in sublinear settings like streaming and PRAM algorithms.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

*Luca Nepote,Alix Lhéritier,Nicolas Bondoux,Marios Kountouris,Maurizio Filippone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Quantum HyperNetworks to optimize Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs) by leveraging quantum computing, outperforming traditional methods like MLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training BiNNs is challenging due to limitations of conventional algorithms, and quantum computing offers a novel way to enhance optimization.

Method: A Variational Quantum Algorithm generates binary weights using quantum circuit measurements, with quantum phenomena aiding solution space exploration. The approach connects to Bayesian inference via ELBO and MMD metrics.

Result: The proposed methods improve trainability and generalization over standard MLE.

Conclusion: Quantum HyperNetworks provide an effective solution for optimizing BiNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

TL;DR: A novel NV center-based magnetic microscopy technique enables dynamic 3D imaging of current sources with high spatio-temporal resolution, overcoming limitations of conventional 2D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D Fourier-based methods fail in multilayer or dynamic systems due to signal overlap and noise, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: The technique uses NV centers, a custom micro-coil platform, and per-pixel lock-in detection for high-resolution magnetic field maps. Source localization employs a LASSO-based framework with spatial priors.

Result: Achieves micrometre-scale spatial and millisecond-scale temporal resolution, robustly identifying active current sources in complex systems.

Conclusion: This method significantly improves dynamic 3D current imaging and NV-based magnetometry for applications like biosensing and microelectronics.

Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic imaging with high spatio-temporal resolution is
critical for probing current paths in various systems, from biosensing to
microelectronics. Conventional 2D Fourier-based current source localization
methods are ill-posed in multilayer or dynamic systems due to signal overlap
and noise. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center-based wide-field magnetic microscopy technique for dynamic
three-dimensional imaging and localization of current sources. Using
custom-fabricated multilayer micro-coil platform to emulate localized,
time-varying currents similar to neuronal activity, we acquire magnetic field
maps with micrometre-scale spatial and millisecond-scale temporal resolution
using per-pixel lock-in-based detection. Source localization and image
reconstruction are achieved using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO)-based reconstruction framework that incorporates
experimentally measured basis maps as spatial priors. Our method enables robust
identification of active current sources across space and time, and
significantly advances the accuracy of dynamic 3D current imaging and NV-based
magnetometry for complex systems.

*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODIS introduces object-level self-distillation for vision pretraining, improving accuracy by focusing on individual objects rather than whole images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pretraining methods assume single-object images, limiting scalability for scene-centric datasets. ODIS addresses this by isolating object-specific regions.

Method: ODIS uses object-aware cropping and masked attention to guide transformers toward meaningful content, simplifying scene-level tasks into object-level sub-tasks.

Result: ODIS achieves 82.6% k-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large, demonstrating improved visual representations.

Conclusion: ODIS enhances pretraining by shifting focus to object-level granularity, improving performance on complex datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench is the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with spatial audio, and SAVVY is a novel training-free pipeline to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV-LLMs and benchmarks focus on static or 2D scenes, leaving 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic environments unexplored.

Method: SAVVY uses a two-stage pipeline: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation for object tracking and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction for unified trajectory mapping.

Result: SAVVY significantly improves AV-LLM performance, setting a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench and SAVVY advance the field by addressing dynamic 3D spatial reasoning with synchronized audio-visual data.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

TL;DR: SPD method improves vision-based reinforcement learning by extracting task-relevant features from images with distractions, using weak and strong augmentations to predict transitions, outperforming prior methods in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling task-irrelevant distractions (e.g., shadows, clouds) in vision-based RL is challenging, especially when such distractions are unseen during training.

Method: SPD uses weak and strong augmentations to predict inverse and forward transitions between augmented versions of observations.

Result: SPD outperforms previous methods in MuJoCo visual control tasks and CARLA autonomous driving, especially for unseen observations.

Conclusion: SPD effectively generalizes to unseen observations, enhancing robustness in vision-based RL.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a surrogate model for generating adversarial perturbations in vision-language models, outperforming existing multi-modal and single-modality attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models lack robustness against small perturbations, necessitating evaluation of their inter-modal dependencies.

Method: A surrogate model is trained to generate joint representations from image and text inputs, enabling coordinated adversarial attacks on both modalities.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms existing attacks, compromising the robustness of state-of-the-art models like instruct-BLIP and ViLT.

Conclusion: The method effectively evaluates and challenges the robustness of vision-language models, highlighting vulnerabilities in multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is proposed to evaluate video classification robustness by targeting sensitive spatial and temporal regions with minimal perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video classification models are more complex and costly to evaluate than image-based models, requiring minimal perturbations for misclassification.

Method: Uses a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (spatial and temporal) to cooperatively identify and perturb sensitive regions while maintaining temporal coherence.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on Lp metric and average queries, with custom distortion types for relevant robustness evaluation.

Conclusion: The method effectively evaluates robustness of video action recognition models, demonstrated on HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR image segmentation face challenges in convergence speed and stability due to complex data distributions.

Method: Integrated mode normalization into U-Net and SegNet to evaluate its impact on convergence and stability.

Result: Mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence and enhances model stability across different zones.

Conclusion: Normalization is effective for improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORSE-500 is a dynamic video benchmark addressing limitations of static benchmarks by testing multimodal reasoning across six categories, with scalable difficulty for future models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks lack temporal complexity, narrow focus on math, and saturate quickly, limiting progress in multimodal reasoning.

Method: MORSE-500 uses 500 scripted video clips generated via Python scripts, generative models, and real footage, enabling fine-grained control over complexity.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant performance gaps, especially in abstract and planning tasks.

Conclusion: MORSE-500 supports evolving, reproducible research in multimodal reasoning, addressing current benchmark shortcomings.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method addresses sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles by using timestamp offsets and data augmentation, improving performance under stale conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor staleness in autonomous vehicles causes temporal misalignment, degrading trajectory predictions critical for safety.

Method: Uses per-point timestamp offsets for LiDAR/radar relative to camera and data augmentation to simulate realistic staleness patterns.

Result: The approach maintains consistent performance under both synchronized and stale conditions, unlike conventional models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates sensor staleness, enhancing perception system robustness.

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method (SPAT) for detecting and delineating allergy wheals using 32 images under varied lighting, outperforming single-image conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and accuracy in diagnosing inhalant allergies by leveraging multiple images under distinct lighting conditions.

Method: Combines a neural network for pixel-level wheal segmentation with an algorithmic approach for detection and delineation, using manually annotated data from 868 patients.

Result: The method, tested on 217 patients, shows higher accuracy with 32 varied lighting images compared to single conventional images.

Conclusion: SPAT's multi-image approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy over traditional single-image methods.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for semi-supervised semantic segmentation focus solely on accuracy, neglecting reliability and robustness, which are crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Result: Evaluations show semi-supervised methods often sacrifice reliability for accuracy, with UniMatchV2 demonstrating robustness but persistent reliability issues.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for holistic metrics like RSS to align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

### [218] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSNI, a sample-specific noise injection framework for diffusion-based purification (DBP), improving accuracy and robustness by adapting noise levels per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBP methods use a constant noise level for all samples, but the paper finds that optimal noise levels vary per sample, motivating SSNI.

Method: SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate sample deviation (score norms) and adaptively adjusts noise levels (t*) per sample.

Result: SSNI enhances DBP methods, improving accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: Sample-specific noise injection is crucial for DBP, and SSNI demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tensor-to-tensor layer (FIS) with linear cost is proposed, leveraging corner trees and multiparameter generalizations of signatures. It integrates into pipelines, matching larger models' accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional tensor data in deep learning requires efficient subquadratic processing layers, addressing scalability issues in image and tensor processing.

Method: Utilizes corner trees and multiparameter generalizations of signatures to create the FIS layer, enabling linear-cost tensor processing.

Result: Achieves similar accuracy to larger ResNet models with fewer parameters (0.1% difference) and 97.3% AUROC in anomaly detection on MVTec AD.

Conclusion: The FIS layer is a scalable, efficient solution for tensor processing, compatible with existing architectures and effective in tasks like classification and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDS-Net, a dual-branch CNN for infrared small target detection, addressing feature heterogeneity and fusion inefficiencies to improve accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based IRSTD methods inefficiently handle shallow-deep feature collaboration and lack systematic modeling of feature hierarchies, limiting performance and computational efficiency.

Method: SDS-Net uses a dual-branch architecture to separately model structural and semantic features, with an adaptive fusion module for dynamic cross-layer feature correlation.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed, with low computational complexity.

Conclusion: SDS-Net achieves superior IRSTD performance, offering high precision, efficiency, and broad application potential.

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

### [221] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)
*Wenyuan Li,Shunlin Liang,Yuxiang Zhang,Liqin Liu,Keyan Chen,Yongzhe Chen,Han Ma,Jianglei Xu,Yichuan Ma,Shikang Guan,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H2Crop, a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset combining EnMAP hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 time series for fine-grained crop classification. A dual-stream Transformer architecture is proposed, improving classification accuracy by 4.2% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained crop classification is essential for precision agriculture and food security but is hindered by challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and annotation costs.

Method: The authors construct the H2Crop dataset and propose a dual-stream Transformer with specialized pathways for hyperspectral and temporal data, along with hierarchical classification heads.

Result: Adding hyperspectral data improves F1-scores by 4.2% on average (peaking at 6.3%), outperforming existing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The H2Crop dataset and dual-stream Transformer architecture provide a robust benchmark and solution for fine-grained crop classification, demonstrating the value of hyperspectral data.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MF$^2$, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to comprehend and recall key narrative details from full-length movies, highlighting current models' shortcomings compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for VLMs focus on superficial details or semi-automated questions, failing to assess deep comprehension of long-form video content like movies.

Method: MF$^2$ uses manually constructed claim pairs (true and false) targeting core narrative elements, evaluated via a binary protocol to reduce biases.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans, showing limited ability to retain and reason over narrative information.

Conclusion: MF$^2$ reveals a gap in VLMs' narrative comprehension, emphasizing the need for models to improve deep understanding of long-form content.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Motivation: To address scalability, efficiency, and interpretability issues in modern deep learning architectures like Transformers by leveraging theoretical foundations of ITTMs.

Result: The USM framework overcomes inefficiencies and rigidity of current models, offering modular, interpretable, and resource-efficient computation.

Conclusion: The USM lays the groundwork for scalable, generalizable AI systems, addressing fundamental challenges in deep learning.

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep

extend classical computation into transfinite ordinal steps. Using ITTMs, we
reinterpret modern architectures like Transformers, revealing fundamental
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and interpretability. Building on these
insights, we propose the Universal State Machine (USM), a novel computational
paradigm designed from first principles. The USM employs a dynamic, queryable

*André Galligo,Joseph Najnudel,Truong Vu*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the convergence of empirical measures derived from derivatives of polynomials with roots sampled from a rotationally invariant probability measure. It addresses a conjecture about the limiting measure satisfying a specific PDE and proves a variant under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by a conjecture regarding the behavior of empirical measures from polynomial derivatives, aiming to understand their limiting distribution and the associated PDE.

Method: The authors analyze the empirical measure of roots from derivatives of polynomials, focusing on a specific family of samplings. They use PDE theory and probabilistic methods to derive results.

Result: A variant of the conjecture is proven, showing convergence to a rotationally invariant measure under certain conditions. Differences between 1D and 2D settings are highlighted.

Conclusion: The work confirms a variant of the conjecture and underscores key distinctions between one- and two-dimensional cases, contributing to the understanding of empirical measures in complex analysis.

Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability
measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$
with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the
empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t
N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$.
  A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger \cite{o2021nonlocal},
reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko
\cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and
Renfrew \cite{campbell2024fractional}, states that under suitable conditions of
regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample,
  $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$
when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density
  $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left(
\frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right),
  \end{equation} In \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, this equation is reformulated
as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of
$(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial
\Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} }
{\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of
$N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also
emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the
one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem \ref{monotonicity}.

TL;DR: This paper examines security vulnerabilities in vision foundation models like CLIP and ViTs, focusing on adversarial attack transferability to downstream tasks, and introduces a novel task-agnostic attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are widely used but vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing risks to their reliability in industrial applications.

Method: The study introduces a novel adversarial attack targeting transformer-based architectures, tested on tasks like classification, captioning, and segmentation.

Result: The attack proves effective across multiple downstream tasks, highlighting the models' vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for robust defenses in foundation models to mitigate adversarial threats.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

TL;DR: Sylva is a personalized federated adversarial training framework that improves communication efficiency and model robustness by using LoRA for local fine-tuning and a game-based layer selection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of federated adversarial training (FAT) in handling heterogeneous data distributions and high communication costs.

Method: Two-phase process: 1) LoRA-based local adversarial fine-tuning to reduce communication costs, and 2) game-based layer selection to enhance benign accuracy.

Result: Achieves up to 50x communication efficiency, 29.5% better adversarial robustness, and 50.4% higher benign accuracy.

Conclusion: Sylva effectively balances robustness and accuracy while minimizing communication overhead in federated adversarial training.

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

### [228] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FERRET, a 1-bit gradient compression method, achieves mutual-information differential privacy (MI-DP) without additive noise, outperforming DPSGD in perplexity and efficiency while matching non-private training utility in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy-utility-performance trilemma in gradient compression, leveraging MI-DP for ethical training with minimal data leakage.

Method: Proposes FERRET, transmitting one sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking, ensuring privacy loss is bounded by epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2.

Result: FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH outperforms DPSGD in perplexity (3.98 vs 11.61 at epsilon=0.5) and efficiency (19-33% of DPSGD's training time), with MI-AUC at chance (~0.51).

Conclusion: FERRET demonstrates that sign-based MI-DP can achieve privacy, utility, and performance simultaneously, with up to 5x faster training and 3x lower perplexity than DPSGD.

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Stealix is a novel model-stealing method that eliminates the need for manual prompts, using genetic algorithms to refine synthetic images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model stealing threatens ML security by replicating black-box models without training data, but current methods rely on manual prompts, limiting scalability.

Method: Stealix uses pre-trained diffusion models and a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine prompts, improving synthetic image precision and diversity.

Result: Stealix outperforms other methods, even those with class names or fine-grained prompts, under the same query budget.

Conclusion: The scalability and effectiveness of Stealix highlight greater risks from pre-trained generative models in model stealing than previously thought.

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the {fairmetrics} R package for evaluating group-based fairness in ML models, addressing biases related to protected attributes like race or gender.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure ML models avoid biased outcomes for specific groups, preventing structural inequalities.

Method: The {fairmetrics} package provides a framework for assessing fairness using metrics like statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity, with point and interval estimates.

Result: The package includes a wrapper function for easy evaluation and an example dataset from MIMIC-II.

Conclusion: {fairmetrics} offers a practical tool for rigorous fairness evaluation in ML, aiding bias mitigation.

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

### [231] [Voice Impression Control in Zero-Shot TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05688)
*Keinichi Fujita,Shota Horiguchi,Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A method for controlling voice impressions in zero-shot TTS using a low-dimensional vector, validated by objective and subjective evaluations, and enhanced by LLM-based generation from natural language descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulating para-/non-linguistic information in speech to control perceived voice impressions is challenging in zero-shot TTS.

Method: Uses a low-dimensional vector to represent voice impression intensities (e.g., dark-bright) and generates this vector via a large language model from natural language descriptions.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in impression control through objective and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The method successfully controls voice impressions in zero-shot TTS and eliminates manual optimization by leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

### [232] [Label-Context-Dependent Internal Language Model Estimation for CTC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06096)
*Zijian Yang,Minh-Nghia Phan,Ralf Schlüter,Hermann Ney*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: CTC implicitly learns a context-dependent internal language model (ILM) despite its label context independence assumption. The paper proposes novel ILM estimation methods using knowledge distillation (KD) and regularization, showing improved performance in cross-domain evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and improve the implicit context dependency in CTC's ILM, addressing limitations of its label context independence assumption.

Method: Proposes context-dependent ILM estimation via knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical backing and introduces two KD regularization methods.

Result: Context-dependent ILMs outperform context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, with label-level KD and smoothing achieving over 13% relative WER improvement.

Conclusion: CTC learns a context-dependent ILM, and the proposed KD-based methods effectively enhance its performance, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

### [233] [Applying XAI based unsupervised knowledge discovering for Operation modes in a WWTP. A real case: AQUAVALL WWTP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05958)
*Alicia Beneyto-Rodriguez,Gregorio I. Sainz-Palmero,Marta Galende-Hernández,María J. Fuente,José M. Cuenca*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an XAI-based methodology to analyze WWTP operation modes using ML, making complex data interpretable for managers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Freshwater scarcity and the need for efficient wastewater treatment drive the need for better WWTP monitoring and understanding.

Method: An XAI and ML approach is applied to historical WWTP data to extract explainable operation modes.

Result: The methodology successfully summarizes complex data into interpretable operation modes, highlighting key variables and units.

Conclusion: XAI and ML can effectively support WWTP management by providing clear, actionable insights from large datasets.

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.
