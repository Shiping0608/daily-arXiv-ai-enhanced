MOSAIC combines three\nmechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine\nsimilarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and\n(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL\nbenchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated\nlearners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds\nsolutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The\ncollaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the\nemergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings\nsupport the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve\nbetter and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and\ncollective levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "MOSAIC is an agentic AI algorithm enabling decentralized, collaborative learning among agents without centralized control, improving efficiency and solving tasks beyond isolated learners' capabilities.", "motivation": "To address challenges in decentralized agentic systems, such as limited bandwidth and lack of common objectives, by enabling scalable, open-ended, and collaborative learning.", "method": "MOSAIC combines modular policy composition, cosine similarity estimation with Wasserstein embeddings, and asynchronous communication for knowledge sharing.", "result": "MOSAIC shows greater sample efficiency, faster learning, and solves tasks unattainable by isolated learners, with emergent ideal task curricula.", "conclusion": "Collaborative learning in agentic systems enhances performance at individual and collective levels, supporting continuous evolution."}}

However,\nmost existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,\nfailing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization\nbitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make\nkey assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be\nexpressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat\nformulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose\nclosed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise\nquantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,\nachieving up to 56$\\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large\nlanguage models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical\nresults derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also\nprovide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains.

Many focus on peripheral,\n``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval\nover deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces MF$^2$, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to comprehend and recall key narrative details from full-length movies, highlighting current models' shortcomings compared to humans.", "motivation": "Current benchmarks for VLMs focus on superficial details or semi-automated questions, failing to assess deep comprehension of long-form video content like movies.", "method": "MF$^2$ uses manually constructed claim pairs (true and false) targeting core narrative elements, evaluated via a binary protocol to reduce biases.", "result": "State-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly worse than humans, showing limited ability to retain and reason over narrative information.", "conclusion": "MF$^2$ reveals a gap in VLMs' narrative comprehension, emphasizing the need for models to improve deep understanding of long-form content."}}
