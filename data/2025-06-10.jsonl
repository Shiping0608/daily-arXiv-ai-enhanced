By simplifying the governing equations\naccording to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver\nseamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting\nflow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional\nstreamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport\nproperties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or\nelectron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE)\non the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the\ncell level. This enables a high-fidelity representation of evolving plasma\nchemistry and dynamics by capturing temporal and spatial variations in mixture\ncomposition and temperature. To improve computational efficiency for this\nmultiscale, multiphysics system, we employ adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in\nthe plasma channel, dynamic load balancing for parallelization, and time-step\nsubcycling for fast and slow transport processes. The solver is first verified\nagainst six established plasma codes for positive-streamer simulations and\nbenchmarked against Cantera for a freely propagating hydrogen flame, then\napplied to three cases: (1) spark discharge in airflow; (2) streamer\npropagation in a premixed flame; and (3) flame dynamics under non-breakdown\nelectric fields. These applications validate the model's ability to predict NTP\nproperties such as fast heating and radical production and demonstrate its\npotential to reveal two-way coupling between plasma and combustion."}

Building upon the gas-plasma kinetics\nsolver, ChemPlasKin, and the CFD library, OpenFOAM, the integrated solver,\nreactPlasFOAM, allows simulation of fully coupled plasma-combustion systems\nwith versatility and high performance. By simplifying the governing equations\naccording to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver\nseamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting\nflow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional\nstreamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport\nproperties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or\nelectron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE)\non the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the\ncell level.

Two temperature ranges are considered: a\nsubcritical case, where the fluid remains entirely in the liquid-like regime,\nand a transcritical case, where the pseudo-critical (Widom) line is crossed and\npseudo-boiling occurs. Fully compressible direct numerical simulations are used\nto study (i) the linear and nonlinear instabilities, (ii) the breakdown to\nturbulence, and (iii) the fully developed turbulent boundary layer. In the\ntranscritical regime, two-dimensional forcing generates not only a train of\nbillow-like structures around the Widom line, resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, but also near-wall travelling regions of flow reversal. These\nspanwise-oriented billows dominate the early nonlinear stage. When high\nsubharmonic three-dimensional forcing is applied, staggered $\\Lambda$-vortices\nemerge more abruptly than in the subcritical case. However, unlike the classic\nH-type breakdown under zero pressure gradient observed in ideal-gas and\nsubcritical regimes, the H-type breakdown is triggered by strong shear layers\ncaused by flow reversals -- similar to that observed in\nadverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers. Without oblique wave forcing,\ntransition is only slightly delayed and follows a naturally selected\nfundamental breakdown (K-type) scenario. Hence, in the transcritical regime, it\nis possible to trigger nonlinearities and achieve transition to turbulence\nrelatively early using only a single two-dimensional wave that strongly\namplifies background noise. In the fully turbulent region, we demonstrate that\nvariable-property scaling accurately predicts turbulent skin-friction and\nheat-transfer coefficients."}

We have thus studied periodic\napproximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and\ntwisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose\nrotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called \"magic\nangle\". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states\ndistributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even\nthousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such\nas \"heterostrain\". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by\nusual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity\noperator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned.\nIn twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other\nelectron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D\nnanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant\nelectronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies\non monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes,\nmonolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result\nis the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer\ngraphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the\nfunctionalized sublattice type.
