Two temperature ranges are considered: a\nsubcritical case, where the fluid remains entirely in the liquid-like regime,\nand a transcritical case, where the pseudo-critical (Widom) line is crossed and\npseudo-boiling occurs. Fully compressible direct numerical simulations are used\nto study (i) the linear and nonlinear instabilities, (ii) the breakdown to\nturbulence, and (iii) the fully developed turbulent boundary layer. In the\ntranscritical regime, two-dimensional forcing generates not only a train of\nbillow-like structures around the Widom line, resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, but also near-wall travelling regions of flow reversal. These\nspanwise-oriented billows dominate the early nonlinear stage. When high\nsubharmonic three-dimensional forcing is applied, staggered $\\Lambda$-vortices\nemerge more abruptly than in the subcritical case. However, unlike the classic\nH-type breakdown under zero pressure gradient observed in ideal-gas and\nsubcritical regimes, the H-type breakdown is triggered by strong shear layers\ncaused by flow reversals -- similar to that observed in\nadverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers.
