This AMG method extends an idea proposed by Reitzinger and Schoberl.\nThe main feature of the Reitzinger and Schoberl algorithm (RSAMG) is that it\nmaintains null-space properties of the Curl-Curl operator throughout all levels\nof the AMG hierarchy. It does this by enforcing a commuting relationship\ninvolving grid transfers and the discrete gradient operator. This null-space\npreservation property is critical to the algorithm's success, however enforcing\nthis commuting relationship is non-trivial except in the special case where one\nleverages a piece-wise constant nodal interpolation operator. For this reason,\nmesh independent convergence rates are generally not observed for RSAMG due to\nits reliance on sub-optimal piece-wise constant interpolation. We present a new\nAMG algorithm that enforces the same commuting relationship. The main advance\nis that the new structure preserving H-curl algorithm (SpHcurlAMG) does not\nrely on piece-wise constant interpolation and can leverage fairly general and\nmore sophisticated nodal interpolation operators. The key idea is to employ\nenergy minimization AMG (EAMG) to construct edge interpolation grid transfers\nand to enforce the commuting relationship by embedding it as constraints within\nan EAMG procedure. While it might appear that solving such a constrained energy\nminimization is costly, we illustrate how this is not the case in our context.\nNumerical results are then given demonstrating mesh independent convergence\nover a range of test problems."}

Microstructural features such as grain boundaries (GBs),\nsubgrains, localized deformation bands, and non-uniform dislocation\ndistributions critically influence grain nucleation and growth during\nrecrystallization. Traditionally, modeling this coupled evolution involves\nseparate, specialized frameworks for mechanical deformation and microstructural\nkinetics, typically used in a staggered manner. Nucleation is often introduced\nad hoc, with nuclei seeded at predefined sites based on criteria like critical\ndislocation density, stress or strain. This is a consequence of the inherent\nlimitations of the staggered approach, where newly formed GBs or grains have to\nbe incorporated with additional processing. In this work, we propose a unified,\nthermodynamically consistent field theory that enables spontaneous nucleation\ndriven by stored dislocations at GBs. The model integrates Cosserat crystal\nplasticity with the Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp orientation phase field approach,\nallowing the simulation of key microstructural defects, as well as curvature-\nand stored energy-driven grain boundary migration. The unified approach enables\nseamless identification of GBs that emerge from deformation and nucleation.\nNucleation is activated through a coupling function that links\ndislocation-related free energy contributions to the phase field. Dislocation\nrecovery occurs both at newly formed nuclei and behind migrating GBs. The\nmodel's capabilities are demonstrated using periodic bicrystal and polycrystal\nsimulations, where mechanisms such as strain-induced boundary migration,\nsubgrain growth, and coalescence are captured.
