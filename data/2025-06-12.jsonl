Prior\nresearch introduced the concept of Energy Transition Domain to support the\ncreation of a comprehensive database of Ballistic Captures in the planar\nCircular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, to apply these trajectories to\na real mission scenario, a three-dimensional, spatial analysis and transition\nto an ephemeris model are necessary. This paper first extends the Energy\nTransition Domain framework to the spatial case, constructing an extensive\ndatabase of spatial Ballistic Captures. Then, using Lunar Trailblazer as a case\nstudy, a subset of the trajectories is filtered using a mission-specific\ndistance metric, and transitioned into an ephemeris model. Finally, interesting\nfeatures of this subset are analyzed, and sample high-fidelity trajectories are\nselected as potential backup options for Lunar Trailblazer."}
