While these algorithms are\nwell-suited for a wide range of equations, they often exhibit suboptimal\nperformance when applied to equations with large local gradients, resulting in\nsubstantial localized errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes an\nadaptive PINN algorithm designed to improve accuracy in such cases. The core\nidea of the algorithm is to adaptively adjust the distribution of collocation\npoints based on the recovery-type a-posterior error of the current numerical\nsolution, enabling a better approximation of the true solution. This approach\nis inspired by the adaptive finite element method. By combining the\nrecovery-type a-posteriori estimator, a gradient-recovery estimator commonly\nused in the adaptive finite element method (FEM) with PINNs, we introduce the\nRecovery-type a-posteriori estimator enhanced adaptive PINN (R-PINN) and\ncompare its performance with a typical adaptive PINN algorithm, FI-PINN. Our\nresults demonstrate that R-PINN achieves faster convergence with fewer adaptive\npoints and significantly outperforms in the cases with multiple regions of\nlarge errors than FI-PINN.

Preventing damage from the intense localised heat loads REs can\ncause requires a holistic approach that considers plasma, REs and PFC damage.\nDespite decades of progress in understanding the physics of REs and the\nthermomechanical response of PFCs, their complex interplay remains poorly\nunderstood. This document aims to initiate a coordinated, interdisciplinary\napproach to bridge this gap by reviewing experimental evidence, advancing\ndiagnostic capabilities, and improving modelling tools across different scales,\ndimensionalities and fidelities. Key topics include RE beam formation and\ntransport, damage mechanisms in brittle and metallic PFCs, and observations in\nmajor facilities such as JET, DIII-D, WEST and EAST.

To circumvent this problem and further increase\nthe speedup, we combine the ParaDIn method with the Parareal algorithm to\nefficiently parallelize the first-order time derivative term in nonlinear\npartial differential equations discretized by the method of lines. The main\nidea of the proposed approach is to use a block-Jacobi preconditioner, so that\neach block is solved by using the ParaDIn method. To accelerate the convergence\nof Jacobi iterations, we use the Parareal method which can be interpreted as a\ntwo-level multigrid method in time. In contrast to the conventional Parareal\nalgorithm whose coarse grid correction step is performed sequentially, both the\ncoarse- and fine-grid propagators in the proposed approach are implemented in\nparallel by using the ParaDIn method, thus significantly increasing the\nparallel performance of the combined algorithm. Numerical results show that the\nnew combined ParaDIn-Parareal method provides the speedup of up to 124 on 480\ncomputing cores as compared with the sequential first-order implicit backward\ndifference (BDF1) scheme for the 2-D nonlinear heat and Burgers equations with\nboth smooth and discontinuous solutions."}

In 2D models, an ad hoc softening\nprescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical\nstructure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short\ndistances and doesn't respect Newton's third law.\n  To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation,\nwe developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported\ndiscs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a\nprecise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D\nnumerical tests.\n  The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian\ngravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from\nlight to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In\ncontrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of\nleading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational\nrunaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances.\n  We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods\nbased on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational\nefficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations\ninherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent\ntreatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that\nmakes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to\nstudying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by\n2D-flat numerical simulations.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.
