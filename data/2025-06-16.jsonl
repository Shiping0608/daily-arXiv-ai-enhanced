J. High Perform. Comput. Appl., 38 (2024), p.\n297-313] have proposed a strategy to recast a floating-point matrix\nmultiplication in terms of integer matrix products. The factors A and B are\nsplit into integer slices, the product of these slices is computed exactly, and\nAB is approximated by accumulating these integer products in floating-point\narithmetic. This technique is particularly well suited to mixed-precision\nmatrix multiply-accumulate units with integer support, such as the NVIDIA\ntensor cores or the AMD matrix cores. The number of slices allows for\nperformance-accuracy tradeoffs: more slices yield better accuracy but require\nmore multiplications, which in turn reduce performance. We propose an\ninexpensive way to estimate the minimum number of multiplications needed to\nachieve a prescribed level of accuracy. Our error analysis shows that the\nalgorithm may become inaccurate (or inefficient) if rows of A or columns of B\nare badly scaled. We perform a range of numerical experiments, both in\nsimulation and on the latest NVIDIA GPUs, that confirm the analysis and\nillustrate strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm."}

In general the\npassage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena captured in\nterms of the Kodaira map and its suitable extension respectively for genus\n$\\mathfrak{g}=2$ and $\\mathfrak{g}=3.$ Here we handle the case of surfaces of\nany genus. In Theorem , we are able to encompass the blow up situation in terms\nof an appropriate \"orthogonality\" condition. Subsequently, we can provide the\nexistence and uniqueness of (CMC) 1-immersions under an appropriate \"generic\"\ncondition, see Theorem 2."}

As datasets\ncontinue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices\nbecome increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct\nformation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on\nmatrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the\nmatrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,\nor when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can\nbe restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these\ncases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit\noperator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In\nsuch settings, the matrix is \"impalpable,\" in the sense that we have access to\nonly masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory\nto introduce a novel method of \"free decompression\" to estimate the spectrum of\nsuch matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical\nspectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely\nlarge (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full\nmatrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting\ndistributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as\napplying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their\nfull empirical eigenspectra."}
