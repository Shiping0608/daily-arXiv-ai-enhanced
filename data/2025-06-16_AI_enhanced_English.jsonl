As datasets\ncontinue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices\nbecome increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct\nformation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on\nmatrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the\nmatrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,\nor when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can\nbe restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these\ncases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit\noperator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In\nsuch settings, the matrix is \"impalpable,\" in the sense that we have access to\nonly masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory\nto introduce a novel method of \"free decompression\" to estimate the spectrum of\nsuch matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical\nspectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely\nlarge (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full\nmatrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting\ndistributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as\napplying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their\nfull empirical eigenspectra.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel method called 'free decompression' is introduced to estimate the spectrum of extremely large matrices using principles from free probability theory, even when direct access to the matrix is impractical.", "motivation": "The need to compute eigenvalues of very large matrices in machine learning tasks is hindered by impractical matrix sizes and restricted access to data, especially in distributed learning or indirect matrix definitions.", "method": "The method leverages free probability theory to extrapolate the eigenspectrum from small submatrices, enabling estimation without full matrix access or matrix-vector products.", "result": "The approach effectively estimates spectra, validated against synthetic examples and real-world datasets, matching known distributions and empirical spectra.", "conclusion": "Free decompression provides a viable solution for spectral estimation of impalpable matrices, addressing limitations of traditional methods."}}
