At\nthis time, the classical function space has certain restrictions. For example,\nit has lost its effectiveness for nonlinear problems under nonstandard growth\nconditions. In the process of studying such nonlinear problems, scholars are\npaying more and more attention to the transition from classical function space\nto variable exponent function space. Also, there is a big difference between\nvariable exponent space and classical function space, mainly because variable\nexponent function space has lost translation invariance. This difference leads\nto many properties that hold in classical space no longer hold in variable\nexponent space. It is important to emphasize that variable exponent function\nspaces are a fundamental building block in harmonic analysis. In recent years,\nthere has been a growing interest in the study of function spaces equipped with\nvariable exponents, leading to the development of a new framework known as\nvariable exponent analysis. These spaces provide a powerful tool for analyzing\nfunctions with variable growth or decay rates and have found applications in\nvarious areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations,\nharmonic analysis and image processing. One can better understand the\nheterogeneity and complexity inherent in many real world phenomena by taking\ninto consideration the theory of variable exponent function spaces. Thus, by\nusing certain properties of Lipschitz functions and variable exponents, in this\narticle, we establish the boundedness of a class of rough generalized\ncommutators with Lipschitz functions on homogeneous variable exponent Herz and\nHerz-Morrey spaces."}

Here,the first application of deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) for magnetic plasma control on the mid-size DIII-D tokamak is\npresented, demonstrating a nonlinear approach that improves robustness and\nflexibility across plasma scenarios. Using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm,\nthis method eliminates the need for equilibrium reconstruction, enabling\nhigh-speed control execution and scalability on larger fusion devices. NSFsim,\na 2D Grad-Shafranov equilibration solver with a circuit equation and a 1D\ntransport solver, is used to train the agent. Its capability of reproducing the\nkinetic parameter evolution alongside magnetic equilibria evolution appears to\nbe an essential factor significantly affecting control quality. RL-based\ncontrollers demonstrated robust magnetic control in experimental application at\nDIII-D, preserving control performance in transient events during plasma\ndischarges, and reaching target parameters from the first discharge without\nadditional tuning or modifications. The approach itself has significant\ngeneralization potential across devices and targets. This work represents a\nstep toward AI-driven, real-time plasma control, advancing the feasibility of\nnext-generation fusion reactors."}

This manifold has an intricate geometry with\nheterogeneous density, which makes the design of a single (global) nonlinear\nreduced-order model (ROM) challenging. In this paper, we turn this around.\nInstead of modeling the manifold with one single model, we partition the\nmanifold into clusters within which the dynamics are locally modeled. This\nresults in a quantized local reduced-order model (ql-ROM), which consists of\n(i) quantizing the manifold via unsupervised clustering; (ii) constructing\nintrusive ROMs for each cluster; and (iii) seamlessly patch the local models\nwith a change of basis and assignment functions. We test the method on two\nnonlinear partial differential equations, i.e., the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2D\nNavier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow), across bursting, chaotic,\nquasiperiodic, and turbulent regimes. The local models are built via Galerkin\nprojection onto the local principal directions, which are centered on the\ncluster centroids. The dynamics are modeled by switching a local ROM based on\nthe cluster proximity. The proposed ql-ROM framework has three advantages over\nglobal ROMs (g-ROMs): (i) numerical stability, (ii) improved short-term\nprediction accuracy in time, and (iii) accurate prediction of long-term\nstatistics, such as energy spectra and probability distributions. The\ncomputational overhead is minimal with respect to g-ROMs. The proposed\nframework retains the interpretability and simplicity of intrusive\nprojection-based ROMs, whilst overcoming their limitations in modeling complex,\nhigh-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics."}

It is found that under the\nHXHM (high magnetic field helicon experiment) experimental parameters, the\ndisturbed distribution function oscillates explosively at the initial stage of\nBOT instability excitation, and the wave frequency shift does not appear, i.e.,\nthe steady-state solution always exists under this mode.

As the Krook operator increases\n(i.e., from 0.1 to 1), the saturation level of the electric field and the\ninstability enhance. Additionally, there have a bigger disturbance for the\ninitial EEDF (electron energy distribution function) in high-power helicon\ndevices, so that the energy exchange between waves and energetic particles is\nstronger as well.

However, existing DEM heat transfer models have\nfundamental limitations. These issues arise from the soft spring model inherent\nin DEM, where heat conduction is mathematically influenced by the spring\nconstant. Consequently, complex modeling, considering contact state such as\ncontact area and duration, is typically required to estimate heat conduction\naccurately.
