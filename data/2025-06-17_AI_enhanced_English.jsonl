At\nthis time, the classical function space has certain restrictions. For example,\nit has lost its effectiveness for nonlinear problems under nonstandard growth\nconditions. In the process of studying such nonlinear problems, scholars are\npaying more and more attention to the transition from classical function space\nto variable exponent function space. Also, there is a big difference between\nvariable exponent space and classical function space, mainly because variable\nexponent function space has lost translation invariance. This difference leads\nto many properties that hold in classical space no longer hold in variable\nexponent space. It is important to emphasize that variable exponent function\nspaces are a fundamental building block in harmonic analysis. In recent years,\nthere has been a growing interest in the study of function spaces equipped with\nvariable exponents, leading to the development of a new framework known as\nvariable exponent analysis. These spaces provide a powerful tool for analyzing\nfunctions with variable growth or decay rates and have found applications in\nvarious areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations,\nharmonic analysis and image processing. One can better understand the\nheterogeneity and complexity inherent in many real world phenomena by taking\ninto consideration the theory of variable exponent function spaces.
