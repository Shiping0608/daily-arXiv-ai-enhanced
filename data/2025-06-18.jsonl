The definition is based on a modified vector transport of the shapes boundary co-normal into a reference point which accounts for the angular defect that a classical parallel transport would introduce. This modified transport can be easily implemented for general surfaces and differently defined embedded shapes, and the associated irreducible surface Minkowski tensors give rise to the classification of shapes by their normalized eigenvalues, which are introduced as shape measures following the flat-space analog. We analyze different approximations of the embedded shapes, their influence on the surface Minkowski tensors, and the stability to perturbations of the shape and the surface. The work concludes with a series of numerical experiments showing the applicability of the approach on various surfaces and shape representations and an application in biology in which the characterization of cells in a curved monolayer of cells is considered."}

The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy."}

An optimal chemical kinetics model was developed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), an automated tool for constructing reaction mechanisms. This model was validated through 0-D analyses, where simulation result were compared with existing kinetic models (LLNL,JetSurf) and experimental data from conventional n-hexane pyrolysis. Subsequently, 1-D analysis were conducted to identify the optimal operational flow rate in plasma pyrolysis reactor, the results of which informed detailed three-dimensional (2-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the plasma reactor. The CFD simulations reveal that fluid mixing dynamics play a dominant role in determining the extent of conversion and product selectivity, highlighting the limitations of lower-dimensional models in capturing essential transport phenomena. Notably, the simulations indicate a higher C2 monomer selectivity of approximately 50 % under plasma-based n-hexane pyrolysis, in contrast to the roughly 30 % selectivity achieved via conventional fossil-fuel-based methods. These findings underscore the potential advantages of plasma-driven pyrolysis and represent a critical step toward a comprehensive understanding of the complex thermochemical behavior governing plasma-assisted processes."}

We make use of ray-traced GRMHD simulations that are based on different black hole spacetime metrics and accretion physics parameters. These broad classes of models provide a good representation of the primary targets observed by the EHT. To generate realistic synthetic data from our models, we took the signal path as well as the calibration process, and thereby the aforementioned improvements, into account. We could thus produce synthetic visibilities akin to calibrated EHT data and identify salient features for the discrimination of model parameters. We have produced a library consisting of an unparalleled 962,000 synthetic Sgr A* and M87* datasets. In terms of baseline coverage and noise properties, the library encompasses 2017 EHT measurements as well as future observations with an extended telescope array. We differentiate between robust visibility data products related to model features and data products that are strongly affected by data corruption effects. Parameter inference is mostly limited by intrinsic model variability, which highlights the importance of long-term monitoring observations with the EHT. In later papers in this series, we will show how a Bayesian neural network trained on our synthetic data is capable of dealing with the model variability and extracting physical parameters from EHT observations. With our calibration improvements, our newly reduced EHT datasets have a considerably better quality compared to previously analyzed data."}

We integrate in time the reduced order model with the BDF-q time stepping ($1\\le q\\le 5$) and prove optimal rate of convergence of order $q$ in time. Our set of snapshots is obtained from finite element approximations to the original model problem computed at different times. These finite element approximations can be obtained with any time integrator. The POD method is based on first order difference quotients of the snapshots. The reason for doing this is twofold. On the one hand, the use of difference quotients allow us to provide pointwise-in-time error bounds. On the other, the use of difference quotients is essential to get the expected rate $q$ in time since we apply that the BDF-q time stepping, $1\\le q\\le 5$, can be written as a linear combination of first order difference quotients."}

However, ensuring the physical consistency of such models requires embedding fundamental symmetries of plasma dynamics. In this work, we explore a symmetry-embedding strategy based on data augmentation, where symmetry-preserving transformations (e.g., Lorentz and Galilean boosts) are applied to simulation data. Using both sparse regression and neural networks, we show that models trained on symmetry-augmented data more accurately infer the plasma fluid equations and pressure tensor closures from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. We show that this approach suppresses spurious inertial-frame-dependent correlations between dynamical variables, improves data efficiency, and significantly outperforms models trained without symmetry-augmented data, as well as commonly used theoretical pressure closure models. Our results establish symmetry-based data augmentation as a broadly applicable method for incorporating physical structure into machine-learned reduced plasma models."}

We carried out out supervised learning with synthetic millimeter very long baseline interferometry observations of the EHT. Our ground-truth models are based on GRMHD simulations of Sgr A* and M87* on horizon scales. We investigated how well Zingularity neural networks are able to infer key model parameters from EHT observations, such as the black hole spin and the magnetic state of the accretion disk, when uncertainties in the data are accurately taken into account. Zingularity makes use of the TensorFlow Probability library and is able to handle large amounts of data with a combination of the efficient TFRecord data format plus the Horovod framework. Our approach is the first analysis of EHT data with Bayesian neural networks, where an unprecedented training data size, under consideration of a closely modeled EHT signal path, and the full information content of the observational data are used. Zingularity infers parameters based on salient features in the data and is containerized. Through parameter surveys and dedicated validation tests, we identified neural network architectures, that are robust against internal stochastic processes and unaffected by noise in the observational and model data. We give examples of how different data properties affect the network training. We show how the Bayesian nature of our networks gives trustworthy uncertainties and uncovers failure modes for uncharacterizable data. It is easy to achieve low validation errors during training on synthetic data with neural networks, particularly when the forward modeling is too simplified. Through careful studies, we demonstrate that our trained networks can generalize well so that reliable results can be obtained from observational data."}

For various phenomena involving energetic particles, the non-Maxwellian distributions of electrons exhibiting high-energy tails can significantly enhance the ionization process. Therefore, accurately computing ionization and recombination rates with non-Maxwellian electron distributions is essential for emission diagnostic analysis. In this work, we report two methods for fitting various non-Maxwellian distributions by using the Maxwellian decomposition strategy. For standard \\{kappa} distributions, the calculated ionization and recombination rate coefficients show comparable accuracy to other public packages. We apply the above methods to two specific non-Maxwellian distribution scenarios: (I) accelerated electron distributions due to magnetic reconnection revealed in a combined MHD-particle simulation; (II) the high-energy truncated \\{kappa} distribution predicted by the exospheric model of the solar wind. During the electron acceleration process, ionization rates of high-temperature iron ions increase significantly compared to their initial Maxwellian distribution, while the recombination rates may decrease due to the electron distribution changes in low-energy ranges. This can potentially lead to an overestimation of the plasma temperature when analyzing the Fe emission lines under the Maxwellian distribution assumption. For the truncated \\{kappa} distribution in the solar wind, the ionization rates are lower than those for the standard \\{kappa} distribution, while the recombination rates remain similar.

Unlike discrete surface representation approaches, which approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or sub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or sub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear complementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision locations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in contrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting solution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics are unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision resolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface resolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry into finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of collision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface resolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single constraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when unconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling required by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer collision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe 10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method against multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a two-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting ellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut chainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface representations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface roughness."}

These are modeled by considering a highly oscillating potential. The focus of this paper is in the case where the scales of the microstructures are smaller than that of phase separation. We provide a compactness result and prove that the Î-limit of the energy is a multiple of the perimeter. In particular, using the recently introduced unfolding operator for multiple scales, we show that the taking the limit of all of the scales together is equivalent to taking one limit at the time, starting from the smaller scale and keeping the larger fixed."}

The present work aims to establish a general SPH algorithm for accurate and stable simulation of complex multiphase flows in configurations with open boundaries. The general scheme of weakly compressible SPH is adopted with special treatments implemented to ease the numerical oscillation in the density discontinuity scenario, and the turbulent model is implemented for interpretations of extreme flow conditions in high Reynolds numbers. Then, the conventional open boundary condition is fine-tuned by two new algorithms to guarantee the numerical stability in the inflow and the outflow regions. Firstly, a density relaxation is proposed to alleviate the pressure instability in the inflow region, which improves the smoothness of the particle pre-processing procedure. Secondly, the particle shifting technique with adaptive damper is implemented to adjust the magnitude of correction in the outflow region, which helps to suppress the velocity oscillation near the outlet. Validations of the proposed algorithms are carried out through four classic numerical examples, presenting appealing agreements with the analytical solutions and thus demonstrating the versatility in various flow conditions. Then, the robustness of the method is established through the turbulent multiphase channel flow cases and the horizontal slug channel flow with large density ratios. These results shed light on the value of the proposed algorithm as a general solver for complex multiphase flow problems with open boundaries."}

This solution, obtained as an infinite sum over the relevant eigenfunctions, corrects previously published results [D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014)]. To verify our calculations, we perform simulations of the survival probability, that accurately reproduce the analytic solutions for a range of parameter values. We then obtain the corresponding FPT distribution as the negative time derivative of the survival probability. Finally, we derive an expression for mean first-passage time (MFPT), also as a sum over eigenfunctions. Numerical evaluation of the first twenty-five terms in this sum closely matches the MFPT obtained by a different method in D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014). We also find that, in the limit of vanishing trap stiffness, the amplitude of the first term in our infinite-sum solution for the survival probability matches the theoretical escape probability for the potential-free diffusion-to-capture process."}

We provide a careful analysis of this elliptic system and prove optimal regularity for solutions throughout the branch points. For surfaces confined in the unit ball we show that the minimization problem behaves rather rigid and identify a parameter range for which minimizers are always round spheres."}

Supplementary information: 19 pages, 12 figures and tables", "summary": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations."}

Yet, the stepwise impact ionization irregularities worsen with increasing step counts, which are a major source of internal noise in these APDs. Some noise models for staircase APDs have been previously reported, where the excess noise factor expressions are based on Friis' noise factor formula for cascade networks, erroneously considering the power gains as the gains. Excess noise factor being a key component in staircase APDs' noise models, we formulate generalized excess noise factor expressions for multilayer graded-bandgap APDs in terms of their layer-wise ionization probabilities, applicable for all operating biases, which include the sub-threshold, staircase, and tunnelling breakdown regimes. We further derive simplified expressions for staircase APDs and prove that these expressions match Bangera's corrections to Friis' noise factor formulas for cascade networks."}
