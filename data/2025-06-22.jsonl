Consequently, it is essential to construct\nreduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower\ncomputational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and\nparameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models\nis also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability. In this paper, we\nintroduce a nonlinear, non-intrusive, data-driven model order reduction method\nfor the 1D-1V Vlasov--Poisson system, discretized using a Hamiltonian\nParticle-In-Cell scheme. Our approach relies on a two-step projection\nframework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic\nDecomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder\nneural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian\nneural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages:\nfirst, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots;\nsecond, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to\nsimultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics.
