The Koopman operator acts on a function\nspace and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.\nHowever, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)\noffers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with\nerror bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and\nmore efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the\nfirst general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing\nspectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These\nmethods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and\nspectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data\nlimits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a\nuser-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in\n$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided\ndatasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct\nadversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can\nsucceed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.\nNotably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,\nhigh-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,\nmolecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and\nNorthern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available\nin the software package $\\texttt{SpecRKHS}$."}

One of the most well-known and successful\nexamples of this is the companion linearization. In this paper, we construct a\ntransformation that equivalently re-frames a specific type of eigenvalue\nproblem with eigenvector nonlinearities (NEPv) into an eigenvalue problem with\neigenvalue nonlinearities (NEP). The NEPv class considered consists of\nnonlinearities expressed as sums of products of matrices and scalar functions,\nwhere the scalar functions depend nonlinearly on the eigenvector. Our\ntransformation defines the scalar nonlinearities through a polynomial system,\nresulting in NEP nonlinearities of algebraic type. We propose methods to solve\nthe polynomial system, one involving a multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP).\nWe adapt well-established NEP solvers to this setting, with the most effective\nstrategy being a combination of deflation and a locally quadratically\nconvergent iterative method. The efficiency and properties of the approach is\nillustrated by solving a problem related to a modification of a\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The simulations are reproducible and publicly\navailable."}

To study energy\nconversion processes, we calculate Ohmic dissipation, crucial for understanding\nhow energy is converted between plasma and electromagnetic fields. Decomposing\nelectric field components relative to velocity field, we find that energy\nconversion is initially dominated by the resistive electric field, but\nconvective electric fields take over as reconnection progresses. Plasma\nprimarily gains energy within the current sheet and near the separatrix. We\nperform a scan of magnetization for mildly relativistic plasma to examine\nscaling laws previously derived for non-relativistic inflow. We find the inflow\nis slower than predicted, due to conversion of magnetic energy mostly into\nthermal energy, causing strong compressibility. We calculate and verify the\nscaling of the compressibility factor, providing a more accurate representation\nof inflow dynamics. We analyze the impact of a guide field on reconnection and\nenergy partition, finding that a stronger guide field reduces the reconnection\nrate but has minimal effect on the relative distribution of kinetic, magnetic,\nand thermal energy.

Homogenization theory is a powerful tool for\npredicting these properties by averaging the behavior of complex\nmicrostructures over a representative volume element. However, traditional\nnumerical solvers for homogenization problems can be computationally expensive,\nespecially for high-resolution and complicated topology and geometry. Existing\nlearning-based methods, while promising, often struggle with accuracy and\ngeneralization in such scenarios. To address these challenges, we present\nCGINS, a preconditioned-conjugate-gradient-solver-informed neural network for\nsolving homogenization problems.

The integrated\npreconditioned conjugate gradient iterations ensure that the network provides\nPCG-friendly initial solutions for fast convergence and high accuracy.\nAdditionally, CGINS imposes a global displacement constraint to ensure physical\nconsistency, addressing a key limitation in prior methods that rely on\nDirichlet anchors. Evaluated on large-scale datasets with diverse topologies\nand material configurations, CGINS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (relative\nerror below 1%) and outperforms both learning-based baselines and\nGPU-accelerated numerical solvers.

When\ntrained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:\na generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated\nforces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the\nsamples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite\nboth originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion\ntimesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the\nFokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We\ninterpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and\npropose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived\nregularization term enforcing consistency.

They have\nbeen generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain\njunctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems\nresulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large\ndimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of\niterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction\nlines, Calder\\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric\nfield integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When\njunctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches,\nsuch as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines\nand as a result are amenable to Calder\\'on preconditioning. This approach\nentails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced\nonly approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating\ndomains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is\nintroduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only\nslowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero.

To treat the\ncomplex interactions between multiple characteristics and the viscosity, we\ndevelop an approximation scheme that exploits a certain decoupling between\nshocking and nonshocking characteristics. Our analysis makes minimal\nassumptions on the equation, and in particular applies to the compressible\nNavier--Stokes equations with degenerate physical viscosity."}

The proof follows a similar perturbative argument,\nwhich in high dimensions leads to a degenerate and double-phase-type\nEuler-Lagrange system, making the uniform regularity needed to formalize the\nbubbling harder to achieve. Then, we develop a refined neck-analysis leading to\nan energy identity along the approximation, assuming a suitable Struwe-type\nentropy bound along a sequence of critical points.

This new result describes the effect that trap\norientation plays on the capture rate and extends existing results that give\ninformation only on the role of trap position on the capture rate. Our results\nare validated against numerical simulations which confirm the accuracy of the\nasymptotic approximation. In the case of the unit disk domain, we identify a\nbifurcation such that the high order correction to the global MFPT (GMFPT) is\nminimized when the trap is orientated in the radial direction for traps\ncentered at $0<r<r_c :=\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}$. When centered at position $r_c<r<1$,\nthe GMFPT correction is minimized by orientating the trap in the angular\ndirection. In the scenario of a general two-dimensional geometry, we identify\nthe orientation that minimizes the GMFPT in terms of the regular part of the\nNeumann Green's function. This theory is demonstrated on several regular\ndomains such as disks, ellipses and rectangles."}
