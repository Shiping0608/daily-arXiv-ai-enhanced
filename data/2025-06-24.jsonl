The static structure of the\nsystem is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function,\nCenter-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function.\nThe intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P\nremains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell\nangular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD\nwhich are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two\nspherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the\ncluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and\nMean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation\nfunction in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as\ncompared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD.\nTrajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common\naxis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction\ncoefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the\nintroduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster\nrelaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular\nseparation in LD as compared to fMD."}

The standard approach to diffusion problems\nrequires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the\nconservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is\ntraditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material\nmodels. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material\nmodel, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and\nboundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the\nexperimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the\nneed of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation\nlaw a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element\nformulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces\nwhile enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner\nboundaries. This weaker mixed formulation provides a posteriori error\nindicators tailored for this data-driven approach, enabling adaptive\nhp-refinement. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it\neasier to observe how the variation in the datasets results in the\nnon-uniqueness of the solution, which can be quantified to predict the\nuncertainty of the results.
