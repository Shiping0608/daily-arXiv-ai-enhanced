In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that\ninvestigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets,\nimproving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282\n(2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for\napplication. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the\ncausal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used\nin the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic\nquantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater\npotential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in\nunconstrained QeMCMC implementations."}

Motivated by physics, the focus is on plasmas that are\nsimultaneously strongly magnetized and anisotropic. We consider conducting\nfluids that can be described by viscous and resistive barotropic compressible\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. The purpose is to study the asymptotic behaviour\nof global weak solutions, which do exist, for strongly anisotropic plasmas such\nas the large aspect ratio framework. We prove that such anisotropic weak\nsolutions converge to the weak solutions of the RMHD equations. Rigorous\njustification of this limit is performed both in a periodic domain and in the\nwhole space. It turns out that the resulting system is incompressible only in\nthe perpendicular direction to the external strong magnetic field, whereas it\ninvolves compressible features in the parallel direction. In order to pass to\nthe singular limit in the perpendicular direction we exploit, among others,\ntools elaborated for proving the low Mach number limit of compressible fluid\nflows such as the introduction of a fast oscillatory unitary group associated\nto the dynamics of transverse fast magnetosonic waves. In the parallel\ndirection, we bring out compactness arguments and particular cancellations\ncoming from the structure of our equations."}

Lett. 133, 266704 (2024)] which captures\nessential quantum behavior in many-body systems. In this work, we develop a\nrobust numerical methodology tailored to this quantum LLG framework that not\nonly handles the complexity of quantum many-body systems but also preserves the\nintrinsic mathematical structures and physical properties dictated by the\nequation. We apply the proposed method to a class of many-body quantum spin\nsystems, which host topological states of matter, and demonstrate rich quantum\nbehavior, including the emergence of long-time entangled states.
