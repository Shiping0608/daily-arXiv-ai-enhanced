Using a linear stability analysis, we\nshow that the flat surface profile corresponding to the pure conduction state\ndestabilises at a critical Marangoni number $M^*$ via a conserved long-wave\ninstability. For any fixed absolute wave number $k_0$, we find that square and\nhexagonal patterns bifurcate from the flat surface profile at $M=M^* + 4k_0^2$.\nUsing analytic global bifurcation theory, we show that the local bifurcation\ncurves can be extended to global curves of square and hexagonal patterns with\nconstant absolute wave number and mass. We exclude that the global bifurcation\ncurves are closed loops through a global bifurcation in cones argument, which\nalso establishes nodal properties for the solutions. Furthermore, assuming that\nthe Marangoni number is uniformly bounded on the bifurcation branch, we prove\nthat solutions exhibit film rupture, that is, their minimal height tends to\nzero.
