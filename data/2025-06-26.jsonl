Much of this\nknowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To\nactivate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has\nbegun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom\nLLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking\nalgorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose\nupdates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences\ndesigning and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using\nRAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for\nvarious LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the\nArgonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses\ncan enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial\nfocus on scalable Krylov solvers.

While they are well-understood in Hilbert and\nBanach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general\nmetric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the\nproduct of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a\nsystem of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed\nfunctional $\\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on\n$\\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a\nnovel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric\nspaces. We establish a $\\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative\nerror estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects\nanalogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay\nbound for the Nikaid\\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on\nWasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time\nand the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique\nsaddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals.
