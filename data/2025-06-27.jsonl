The objective is to recover the initial\nelectric field $\\mathbf{E}_0$ in a bounded domain $\\Omega \\subset\n\\mathbb{R}^3$, using boundary measurements of the electric field and its normal\nderivative over a finite time interval. Informed by practical constraints, we\nadopt an under-determined formulation of Maxwell's equations that avoids the\nneed for initial magnetic field data and charge density information. To address\nthis inverse problem, we develop a time-dimension reduction approach by\nprojecting the electric field onto a finite-dimensional Legendre\npolynomial-exponential basis in time. This reformulates the original space-time\nproblem into a sequence of spatial systems for the projection coefficients. The\nreconstruction is carried out using the quasi-reversibility method within a\nminimum-norm framework, which accommodates the inherent non-uniqueness of the\nunder-determined setting. We prove a convergence theorem that ensures the\nquasi-reversibility solution approximates the true solution as the noise and\nregularization parameters vanish. Numerical experiments in a fully\nthree-dimensional setting validate the method's performance. The reconstructed\ninitial electric field remains accurate even with $10\\%$ noise in the data,\ndemonstrating the robustness and applicability of the proposed approach to\nrealistic inverse electromagnetic problems."}

Their full discretization results in\na large-scale saddle-point system at each time step that is becoming singular\nfor locking cases and needs effective preconditioners for its fast iterative\nsolution. Instead of constructing spectrally equivalent ones, we develop\nnonsingular preconditioners so that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned\nsystem consist of a cluster around $1$ and an outlier in the order of\n$1/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is a Lam\\'{e} constant that is large for locking\ncases. It is known that the convergence factor of GMRES is bounded by the\nradius of the cluster for this type of systems. Both two- and three-field block\ntriangular Schur complement preconditioners are studied. Upper bounds of the\nradius of the eigenvalue cluster for those systems are obtained and shown to be\nrelated to the inf-sup condition but independent of mesh size, time step, and\nlocking parameters, which reflects the robustness of the preconditioners with\nrespect to parameter variations. Moreover, the developed preconditioners do not\nneed to compute the Schur complement and neither require exact inversion of\ndiagonal blocks except the leading one. A locking-free weak Galerkin finite\nelement method and the implicit Euler scheme are used for the discretization of\nthe governing equation. Both two- and three-dimensional numerical results are\npresented to confirm the effectiveness and parameter-robustness of the\ndeveloped preconditioners."}

These surrogate models are then used\nfor efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis. The framework\nproceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent\ndimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across\nparameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional \"normal-form\" like ROMs\non this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the\nemergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation\ntools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the\nlatent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from\nAndronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to\ncomputational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows\nreconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional\nspace. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an\ninfinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These\nexhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds\nnumber increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and\nconstructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and\nstability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their\nperiod, and stability via Floquet multipliers."}
