Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows\nreconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional\nspace. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an\ninfinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These\nexhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds\nnumber increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and\nconstructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and\nstability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their\nperiod, and stability via Floquet multipliers.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a framework for constructing minimal-dimensional surrogate models from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations using manifold learning and Gaussian Process Regression, enabling efficient bifurcation and stability analysis.", "motivation": "The motivation is to overcome computational challenges in analyzing high-dimensional spatio-temporal dynamics by deriving reduced-order models (ROMs) for efficient bifurcation and stability analysis.", "method": "The method involves four steps: manifold learning to identify latent dimensions, constructing ROMs using Gaussian Process Regression, applying numerical bifurcation tools in latent space, and reconstructing results in the original space.", "result": "The framework successfully identifies latent dimensionality and constructs surrogate models, enabling analysis of bifurcations (e.g., Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork) and limit cycles in canonical flows.", "conclusion": "The proposed framework efficiently bridges high-fidelity simulations with reduced-order modeling, enabling complex bifurcation and stability analyses previously intractable in full space."}}
