In this\npaper, guided by the general equation for nonequilibrium\nreversible-irreversible coupling (GENERIC) framework, a novel GENERIC-guided\nactive learning smoothed particle hydrodynamics (${\\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$) method is\nproposed to obtain effective constitutive relations for reliable simulations of\nviscoelastic flows. By utilizing the GENERIC framework, the target viscoelastic\nconstitutive relation is reduced to a simple functional relation between the\neigenvalues of the conformation tensor and the eigenvalues of its\nthermodynamically conjugated tensorial variable, which incorporates the\nflow-history-dependent memory effect. Based on data and Gaussian process\nregression (GPR), a new active learning strategy is developed to obtain the\nsimplified constitutive relation, in which the generalization ability is\nensured by actively acquiring more data points when needed. Moreover, a novel\nrelative uncertainty is devised to establish an accuracy evaluation tool for\nthe GPR prediction results, which reduces the number of required training data\npoints while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, the SPH method combined with\nthe latest techniques serves as an effective macroscopic numerical method.\nEventually, the Poiseuille flows and the flows around a periodic array of\ncylinders at different Weissenberg numbers are simulated to validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the ${\\rm{G^2ALSPH}}$ method. The Oldroyd-B model\nis used as the ground truth constitutive relation to provide data for GPR,\nbringing analytical solutions for comparison.

This extends previous\nconstructions where the limiting spacetime solves the Einstein-(multiple) null\ndust system (i.e., where the limiting massless Vlasov field can be written as a\nfinite sum of delta measures). The proof proceeds by first approximating\nsolutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system by solutions to the\nEinstein-(multiple) null dust system, then approximating solutions to the\nEinstein-null dust system by vacuum solutions. In the process, we take the\nnumber of families of dusts to infinity."}

While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying\nprocesses, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under\nenvironmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a\nminimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas.\nWe incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing\nwith trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that\nthese mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna\nand grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns\nconsisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental\nconditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the\nmodel predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a\nphenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel\n''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives\ntipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included.\nThese transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem\ntransitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical\nand empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent\ntipping or drive collapse."}

The problem is\nparticularly challenging due to the presence of memory integrals and delayed\nstates, which necessitate strengthening the classical controllability\nrequirement to ensure complete rest at the final time. To address this, we\nadopt the notion of Delay and memory-type null controllability, which demands\nthe vanishing of the state, the accumulated memory term, and the influence of\ndelay at the terminal time. Utilizing duality arguments, we reduce the\ncontrollability analysis to proving suitable observability inequalities for the\ncorresponding adjoint system. We begin with finite-dimensional systems and\nestablish rank-type conditions characterizing controllability. These insights\nare then extended to parabolic partial differential equations with delay and\nmemory terms. By leveraging Carleman estimates and time-dependent control\nstrategies, we derive sufficient conditions under which controllability can be\nachieved. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and illustrate\nthe critical role of moving control regions in neutralizing the effects of\nmemory and delay."}
