The lightning method is a recent development in the\nnumerical solution of linear PDEs which expresses solutions using sums of\npolynomials and rational functions, or more generally as sums of fundamental\nsolutions. The method is particularly well suited to handle domains with sharp\ncorners where solution singularities are present. Boundary conditions are\nformed on a set of collocation points which is then solved as an overdetermined\nlinear system. The approach of the present work is to utilize the Laplace\ntransform to obtain a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved by an\napplication of the lightning method. The numerical inversion of the Laplace\ntransform is then performed by means of Talbot integration. Our validation of\nthe method against existing results and multiple challenging test problems\nshows the method attains spectral accuracy with root-exponential convergence\nwhile being robust across a wide range of time intervals and adaptable to a\nvariety of geometric scenarios."}

The driving instability in the\nsystem is the fluid Kinetic Ballooning Mode (KBM) instability at high beta,\nwhile the tearing mode is kept stable. The formation of magnetic-island-like\nstructures at the spatial scale of the fluid KBM instability is observed quite\nearly in the non-linear phase for most cases studied, and a slow coalescence\nprocess evolves the magnetic structures towards larger and larger scales. Cases\nthat did not show this coalescence process, nor the formation of the small\nscale island-like structures, were seen to have narrower mode structures for\ncomparable instability growth rates, which was achieved by varying the magnetic\nshear. The islands often end up exceeding the radial box size late in the\nnon-linear phase, showing unbounded growth. The impact on the pressure profile\nof turbulence driven magnetic islands is not trivial, showing flattening of the\npressure profile only far from the resonance, where the zonal flow is weaker,\nand the appearance of said flattening is slow, after the island has reached a\nsufficiently large size, when compared with collisional time scales."}

On one hand,\ndiscrete damage and phase-field models are often computationally prohibitive\nfor real world applications and they are less generalizable across different\nmaterial classes. On the other hand, conventional gradient damage models which\nare based on phenomenological laws, though more computationally efficient, they\nsuffer from unrealistic widening of the damage-band as damage progresses. This\npaper presents a modified non-local gradient damage model (MNLD) that overcomes\nthese shortcomings by introducing modifications to the stress degradation\nfunction and forcing term in the Helmholtz free energy expression. These two\nmodifications ensure that as damage approaches its maximum value, both the\nthermodynamic damage driving force for damage vanishes and the evolution of the\nforcing term decays. Consequently, the damage band retains a non-growing\nconstant width throughout its evolution. The proposed approach builds on\ninsights gained from two intermediate models, which addressed the necessary\nconditions separately before integrating them into a unified formulation.\nNumerical validation is performed on several 1D and 2D benchmark problems,\ndemonstrating that the proposed model can reliably produce fixed-width damage\nbands.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

The long-time existence of\nsuch flow is derived using Bernstein-type theorems of higher codimensional\nself-shrinkers in the whole space and the half-space. Another novel aspect is\nthat our hypothesis imposes no restriction on the diameter of the domains,\nwhich implies an existence result for an exterior Dirichlet problem of the\nminimal surface system."}

Among other things, we give a positive solution to the Problem\n151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we\nconstruct a nonzero harmonic function in the whole space that vanishes on the\nedges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we construct certain\nnew nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in\nthe unit ball in n-dimensional space for all n greater than or equal to 4. This\nextends results of Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present some (presumably)\nnew results on harmonic functions in the space whose nodal sets are unions of\n(affine) subspaces."}
