The kernels that appear in these surface\nintegrals are nearly singular when evaluated near the boundary, and\nstraightforward numerical integration produces inaccurate results. In Beale and\nTlupova (Adv. Comput. Math, 2024), an extrapolated regularization method was\nproposed to accurately evaluate the nearly singular single and double-layer\nsurface integrals for harmonic potentials or Stokes flow. The kernels are\nregularized using a smoothing parameter, and then a standard quadrature is\napplied. The integrals are computed for three choices of the smoothing\nparameter to find the extrapolated value to fifth order accuracy. In this work,\nwe apply several techniques to reduce the computational cost of the\nextrapolated regularization method applied to the Stokes single and double\nlayer integrals. First, we use a straightforward OpenMP parallelization over\nthe target points. Second, we note that the effect of the regularization is\nlocal and evaluate only the local component of the sum for three values of the\nsmoothing parameter. The non-local component of the sum is only evaluated once\nand reused in the other sums. This component is still the computational\nbottleneck as it is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size. We apply the\nkernel-independent treecode to these far-field interactions to reduce the CPU\ntime. We carry out experiments to determine optimal parameters both in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency of the computations. We then use these techniques to\ncompute Stokes flow around two spheres that are nearly touching."}

Recent experimental observations showing a\nstrong spatial correlation between NV centers, brown coloration, and the 468 nm\nluminescence center in as-grown CVD diamonds prompted us to investigate the\natomistic origin of these phenomena in the presence of NxVHy-type complex\ndefects.

This procedure dramatically increases the characteristic\ntimescale and reduces the dimensionality of the modeled system. The natural\ncoordinates for such calculations are the constants of motion (COM) of the fast\nparticle motion, which by definition do not change during an orbit. However,\nfor sufficiently complicated fields -- particularly in the presence of local\nmaxima of the electric potential and magnetic field -- the COM are not\nsufficient to specify the particle trajectory. In such cases, multiple domains\nin COM space must be used to solve the problem, with boundary conditions\nenforced between the domains to ensure continuity and particle conservation.\nPreviously, these domains have been imposed by hand, or by recognizing local\nmaxima in the fields, limiting the flexibility of bounce-averaged simulations.\nHere, we present a general set of conditions for identifying consistent domains\nand the boundary condition connections between the domains, allowing the\napplication of bounce-averaged theories in arbitrarily complicated and\ndynamically-evolving electromagnetic field geometries.

Our results reveal a\nstrong diffusion anisotropy along the b and c axes, with dopant behavior\ngoverned by competition between diffusion and incorporation (or dissociation)\nactivation energies. Under interstitial diffusion, Ca$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ and\nMg$^{2+}_{\\text{i}}$ show the most favorable combination of low migration and\nincorporation barriers, making them promising candidates for efficient doping\nalong the b and c axes, respectively.

To this end, very weak solutions are considered to establish the\nwell-posedness of the problem. Most previously proposed numerical methods use\nregularizations of the boundary data. The main purpose of this paper is to use\nthe Raviart--Thomas mixed finite element method to solve the Poisson equation\nwith rough boundary data directly.

It is often used to\nunderstand how stable flow can arise even in strongly interacting singular\nconfigurations. Typical examples include the Sadovskii vortex patches and the\nChaplygin-Lamb dipole. Our first result concerns the stability of a nonempty\ncollection of Sadovskii vortex patches with prescribed impulse and unique\ntraveling speed. If the initial vorticity is close to one of these patches, the\nvorticity travels at a similar speed while staying close to the class up to a\nshift.

In this paper we combine the ideas of both dynamic\nstring-averaging and strong coherence, in order to analyze our GDSA method for\na general class of operators and its bounded perturbation resilience in the\ninconsistent case with weak and strong convergence. We then discuss an\napplication of the GDSA method to the Superiorization Methodology, developing\nresults on the behavior of its superiorized version."}

The parameter $\\eps$ is small and the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ respectively\nrepresent the kinetic energy, the electronic repulsive correlation, the\npotential interaction term between electrons and nuclei. Several expressions\nfor the above terms have been considered in the literature and our framework is\ngeneral enough to include most of them.\n  It is known that in general, when the positive charge of the nuclei is small,\nthe so-called {\\it ionization phenomenon} may occur, consisting in the fact\nthat the minimizers of $F_\\eps$ can have a total mass lower than $m$; this\nphysically means that some of the electrons may escape to infinity when the\nattraction of the nuclei is not strong enough.\n  Our main goal, continuing the research we started in \\cite{bbcd18}, is to\nstudy the asymptotic behavior of the minimizers of $F_\\eps$ as $\\eps\\to0$. We\nshow that the $\\Gamma$-limit functional is defined on sums of Dirac masses and\nhas an explicit expression that depends on the terms $T$, $C$, $U$ that the\nmodel takes into account.\n  Some explicit examples illustrate how the electrons are distributed around\nthe nuclei according to the model used."}

Due to insufficient molecular collisions to achieve equilibrium,\nrarefied gas effects are present in the flow field. Thus, numerical methods\ncapable of accurately resolving multi-scale flows are required. Furthermore,\nhigh-temperature gas effects in hypersonic flows mean vibrational excitation of\npolyatomic molecules. Consequently, numerical methods accounting for\nnon-equilibrium in rotational and vibrational internal energy modes are\nrequired. This study derives a quantified model-competition (QMC) mechanism for\ndiatomic gases with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium, starting from\nintegral solutions of kinetic model equations with rotational and vibrational\nenergy. The QMC mechanism categorize collisional and free-transport particles\nin cell, applying computational weighting based on their local scale regimes.\nWe developed a simplified unified wave-particle (SUWP) method for diatomic\ngases based on QMC mechanism. For the macroscopic of the method, a\nthree-temperature model accounting for rotational and vibrational energy is\nincorporated into both the kinetic inviscid flux scheme and {Navier-Stokes}\nsolvers. For the microscopic of the method, a collisionless DSMC solver is\nemployed to resolve non-equilibrium flow physics. This work validates the\nproposed SUWP method with rotational and vibrational non-equilibrium through\nbenchmark cases, including shock tube, shock structures, flow past a cylinder,\nApollo 6 command module and space station Mir. Compared to the DSMC and\ndeterministic methods, the SUWP method exhibits favorable computational\nefficiency while maintaining accuracy."}

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel particle-based optimization algorithm where velocities are\nupdated via random jumps, a strategy commonly used to enhance stochastic\nexploration. We formalize this approach by describing the dynamics through a\nkinetic modelling of BGK type, offering a unified framework that accommodates\ngeneral noise distributions, including heavy-tailed ones like Cauchy. Under\nsuitable parameter scaling, the model reduces to the Consensus-Based\nOptimization (CBO) dynamics.
