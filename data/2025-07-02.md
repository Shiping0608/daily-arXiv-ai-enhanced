### [1] [Localized evaluation and fast summation in the extrapolated regularization method for integrals in Stokes flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00156)
*Joseph Siebor,Svetlana Tlupova*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to reduce computational costs for evaluating nearly singular surface integrals in Stokes flow using extrapolated regularization, parallelization, and treecode optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boundary integral methods for partial differential equations face inaccuracies with nearly singular kernels. The goal is to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The approach combines extrapolated regularization, OpenMP parallelization, localized regularization effects, and kernel-independent treecode for far-field interactions.

Result: Optimal parameters for accuracy and efficiency are identified, and the method is successfully applied to Stokes flow around nearly touching spheres.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy for evaluating nearly singular integrals in Stokes flow.

Abstract: Boundary integral equation methods are widely used in the solution of many
partial differential equations. The kernels that appear in these surface
integrals are nearly singular when evaluated near the boundary, and
straightforward numerical integration produces inaccurate results. In Beale and
Tlupova (Adv. Comput. Math, 2024), an extrapolated regularization method was
proposed to accurately evaluate the nearly singular single and double-layer
surface integrals for harmonic potentials or Stokes flow. The kernels are
regularized using a smoothing parameter, and then a standard quadrature is
applied. The integrals are computed for three choices of the smoothing
parameter to find the extrapolated value to fifth order accuracy. In this work,
we apply several techniques to reduce the computational cost of the
extrapolated regularization method applied to the Stokes single and double
layer integrals. First, we use a straightforward OpenMP parallelization over
the target points. Second, we note that the effect of the regularization is
local and evaluate only the local component of the sum for three values of the
smoothing parameter. The non-local component of the sum is only evaluated once
and reused in the other sums. This component is still the computational
bottleneck as it is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size. We apply the
kernel-independent treecode to these far-field interactions to reduce the CPU
time. We carry out experiments to determine optimal parameters both in terms of
accuracy and efficiency of the computations. We then use these techniques to
compute Stokes flow around two spheres that are nearly touching.

### [2] [An energy-stable parametric finite element method for Willmore flow with normal-tangential velocity splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00193)
*Harald Garcke,Robert Nürnberg,Quan Zhao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces an energy-stable, fully discrete parametric approximation for Willmore flow in 2D and 3D, handling spontaneous curvature and open surfaces with boundary. It combines mean curvature evolution with tangential velocity, ensuring unconditional energy stability. A novel weak formulation and finite element method are proposed, validated by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and accurate numerical method for Willmore flow in hypersurfaces, accommodating spontaneous curvature and boundary conditions, while ensuring energy stability.

Method: A geometric PDE combining mean curvature evolution and tangential velocity is discretized using a parametric finite element method. A novel weak formulation enforces boundary conditions naturally.

Result: The scheme is unconditionally energy-stable, with rigorous well-posedness and stability proofs. Numerical experiments confirm accuracy and robustness for curves and surfaces.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively computes Willmore flow, offering stability and flexibility for various boundary conditions and dimensions.

Abstract: We propose and analyze an energy-stable fully discrete parametric
approximation for Willmore flow of hypersurfaces in two and three space
dimensions. We allow for the presence of spontaneous curvature effects and for
open surfaces with boundary. The presented scheme is based on a new geometric
partial differential equation (PDE) that combines an evolution equation for the
mean curvature with a separate equation that prescribes the tangential
velocity. The mean curvature is used to determine the normal velocity within
the gradient flow structure, thus guaranteeing an unconditional energy
stability for the discrete solution upon suitable discretization. We introduce
a novel weak formulation for this geometric PDE, in which different types of
boundary conditions can be naturally enforced. We further discretize the weak
formulation to obtain a fully discrete parametric finite element method, for
which well-posedness can be rigorously shown. Moreover, the constructed scheme
admits an unconditional stability estimate in terms of the discrete energy.
Extensive numerical experiments are reported to showcase the accuracy and
robustness of the proposed method for computing Willmore flow of both curves in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

*Hasan Alzubaidi,Yahya Alnashri*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified numerical analysis for time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction models using the gradient discretisation method (GDM), proving convergence rates and solution uniqueness under small time steps. It validates results with numerical tests on the GBF model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for analyzing numerical approximations of time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction models, covering various methods and applications like GBF and GBH models.

Method: Uses the gradient discretisation method (GDM) to analyze convergence rates and prove solution existence/uniqueness. Numerical tests are performed using the hybrid mimetic mixed (HMM) method on general meshes.

Result: Theoretical convergence rates are confirmed by numerical tests, even on highly distorted meshes.

Conclusion: The GDM framework effectively unifies numerical analysis for such models, with practical validation demonstrating robustness across diverse mesh conditions.

Abstract: We use a generic framework, namely the gradient discretisation method (GDM),
to propose a unified numerical analysis for general time-dependent
convection-diffusion-reaction models. We establish novel results for
convergence rates of numerical approximations of such models under reasonable
assumptions on exact solutions, and prove the existence and uniqueness of the
approximate solution for suitably small time steps. The main interest of our
results lies in covering several approximation methods and various applications
of the considered model such as the generalised Burgers-Fisher (GBF) and the
generalised Burgers-Huxley (GBH) models. Numerical tests based on the hybrid
mimetic mixed (HMM) method for the GBF model are performed on various types of
general meshes to examine the accuracy of the proposed gradient scheme. The
results confirm our theoretical rates of convergence, even on mesh with extreme
distortions.

### [4] [Minimal residual rational Krylov subspace method for sequences of shifted linear systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00267)
*Hussam Al Daas,Davide Palitta*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel projection strategy using rational Krylov subspace with minimal residual condition is proposed for solving shifted linear systems, especially for nonsymmetric problems with complex shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with nonsymmetric problems involving complex shifts that are not conjugate pairs, highlighting the need for improved solvers.

Method: The paper introduces a projection strategy based on rational Krylov subspace and a tailored pole selection procedure for faster convergence.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for challenging problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses gaps in current solvers, offering better performance for complex shift scenarios.

Abstract: The solution of sequences of shifted linear systems is a classic problem in
numerical linear algebra, and a variety of efficient methods have been proposed
over the years. Nevertheless, there still exist challenging scenarios
witnessing a lack of performing solvers. For instance, state-of-the-art
procedures struggle to handle nonsymmetric problems where the shifts are
complex numbers that do not come as conjugate pairs. We design a novel
projection strategy based on the rational Krylov subspace equipped with a
minimal residual condition. We also devise a novel pole selection procedure,
tailored to our problem, providing poles for the rational Krylov basis
construction that yield faster convergence than those computed by available
general-purpose schemes. A panel of diverse numerical experiments shows that
our novel approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques, especially
on the very challenging problems mentioned above.

### [5] [Global well-posedness and Asymptotic analysis of a nonlinear heat equation with constraints of finite codimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00160)
*Ashish Bawalia,Zdzisław Brzeźniak,Manil T. Mohan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for a nonlinear heat equation with constraints in bounded domains, using Faedo-Galerkin and compactness methods. It also generalizes asymptotic results to any smooth domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of solutions for a constrained nonlinear heat equation in any dimension.

Method: Faedo-Galerkin approximation, compactness arguments, and leveraging monotonicity and hemicontinuity of nonlinear operators.

Result: Global existence and uniqueness of solutions are proven, and the solution converges to a unique positive ground state for positive initial data.

Conclusion: The study successfully generalizes previous results and confirms the invariance of a Hilbertian manifold describing the constraint.

Abstract: We prove the global existence and the uniqueness of the $L^p\cap
H_0^1-$valued ($2\leq p < \infty$) strong solutions of a nonlinear heat
equation with constraints over bounded domains in any dimension $d\geq 1$.
Along with the \textit{Faedo-Galerkin} approximation method and the compactness
arguments, we utilize the monotonicity and the hemicontinuity properties of the
nonlinear operators to establish the well-posedness results. In particular, we
show that a Hilbertian manifold $\mathbb{M}$, which is the unit sphere in $L^2$
space, describing the constraint is invariant.
  Finally, in the asymptotic analysis, we generalize the recent work of [P.
Antonelli, et. al. \emph{Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations}, 63(4),
2024] to any bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq1$, when the
corresponding nonlinearity is a damping. In particular, we show that, for
positive initial datum and any $2\le p < \infty$, the unique positive strong
solution of the above mentioned nonlinear heat equation with constraints
converges in $L^p\cap H_0^1$ to the unique positive ground state.

### [6] [Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688)
*Zhandos A. Moldabekov,Xuecheng Shao,Hannah M. Bellenbaum,Cheng Ma,Wenhui Mi,Sebastian Schwalbe,Jan Vorberger,Tobias Dornheim*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: A new method combining time-dependent and static DFT improves the accuracy of estimating the electron-electron static structure factor in warm dense hydrogen, addressing limitations of traditional DFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the modeling of astrophysical objects and optimize inertial confinement fusion by improving the accuracy of warm dense matter theory.

Method: Combines time-dependent DFT for dynamic structure factor with static DFT for density response to estimate electron-electron static structure factor.

Result: High accuracy in estimating the electron-electron static structure factor of warm dense hydrogen across various densities and temperatures.

Conclusion: The approach not only benefits warm dense matter studies but also opens new possibilities for exploring electronic correlations within DFT for diverse applications.

Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for
the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further
optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm
dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which,
however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the
utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated
and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the
density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent
DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with
static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the
electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense
hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures.
In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up
new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within
the framework of DFT for a host of applications.
