The kernels that appear in these surface\nintegrals are nearly singular when evaluated near the boundary, and\nstraightforward numerical integration produces inaccurate results. In Beale and\nTlupova (Adv. Comput. Math, 2024), an extrapolated regularization method was\nproposed to accurately evaluate the nearly singular single and double-layer\nsurface integrals for harmonic potentials or Stokes flow. The kernels are\nregularized using a smoothing parameter, and then a standard quadrature is\napplied. The integrals are computed for three choices of the smoothing\nparameter to find the extrapolated value to fifth order accuracy. In this work,\nwe apply several techniques to reduce the computational cost of the\nextrapolated regularization method applied to the Stokes single and double\nlayer integrals. First, we use a straightforward OpenMP parallelization over\nthe target points. Second, we note that the effect of the regularization is\nlocal and evaluate only the local component of the sum for three values of the\nsmoothing parameter. The non-local component of the sum is only evaluated once\nand reused in the other sums. This component is still the computational\nbottleneck as it is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size. We apply the\nkernel-independent treecode to these far-field interactions to reduce the CPU\ntime. We carry out experiments to determine optimal parameters both in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency of the computations. We then use these techniques to\ncompute Stokes flow around two spheres that are nearly touching.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a method to reduce computational costs for evaluating nearly singular surface integrals in Stokes flow using extrapolated regularization, parallelization, and treecode optimization.", "motivation": "Boundary integral methods for partial differential equations face inaccuracies with nearly singular kernels.
