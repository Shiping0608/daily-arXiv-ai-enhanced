Mechanical response\nis characterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive model, relating\nstress to linearized strain. Non-physical strain singularities at the crack\napex are mitigated, ensuring bounded strain magnitudes. This methodology\nsignificantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for\nfirst-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid\nwith a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum\nbalance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. This BVP is solved using a robust\nnumerical scheme combining Picard-type linearization with a continuous Galerkin\nfinite element method for spatial discretization. Numerical results are\npresented for various loading conditions, including uniform tension,\nnon-uniform slope, and parabolic loading, with two distinct material fiber\norientations. It is demonstrated that crack-tip strain growth is substantially\nlower than stress growth. Nevertheless, strain-energy density is found to be\nconcentrated at the crack tip, consistent with linear elastic fracture\nmechanics principles. The proposed framework provides a robust basis for\nformulating physically meaningful, rigorous BVPs, critical for investigating\nfundamental processes like crack propagation, damage, and nucleation in\nanisotropic, strain-limiting elastic solids under diverse loading conditions."}

In\nparticular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a\ngiven sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after\napplying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained\nvia any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence\nor photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography,\nwhich first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then\nreconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach\nwhich computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements.\nTo do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based,\nregularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the\nadvantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically\nfound in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more\nstable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence\nanalysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its\napplication to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical\nimplementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical\ncoherence elastography (OCE) experiment."}
