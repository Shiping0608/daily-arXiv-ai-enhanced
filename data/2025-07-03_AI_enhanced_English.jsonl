This methodology\nsignificantly advances boundary value problem (BVP) formulation, especially for\nfirst-order approximate theories. For a transversely isotropic elastic solid\nwith a crack, the governing equilibrium equation, derived from linear momentum\nbalance and the nonlinear constitutive model, is reduced to a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP.

Numerical results are\npresented for various loading conditions, including uniform tension,\nnon-uniform slope, and parabolic loading, with two distinct material fiber\norientations.

The proposed method formulates mesh movement as an optimization\nproblem, with an objective function defined as a convex combination of a mesh\nquality metric and a measure of the accuracy of the PDE solution obtained via\nfinite element discretization. The proposed formulation achieves optimized,\nwell-defined high-order meshes by integrating mesh quality control, PDE\nsolution accuracy, and robust gradient regularization. We adopt the\nTarget-Matrix Optimization Paradigm to control geometric properties across the\nmesh, independent of the PDE of interest. To incorporate the accuracy of the\nPDE solution, we introduce error measures that control the finite element\ndiscretization error. The implicit dependence of these error measures on the\nmesh nodal positions is accurately captured by adjoint sensitivity analysis.\nAdditionally, a convolution-based gradient regularization strategy is used to\nensure stable and effective adaptation of high-order meshes. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed framework can improve mesh quality and reduce the error by up\nto 10 times for the solution of Poisson and linear elasto-static problems.
