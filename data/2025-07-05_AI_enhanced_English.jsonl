The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a\ndozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in\nthis direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used.\nLarge $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is\nstudied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the\nrenormalization group. While, for $N_z>1$, the critical exponents calculated\nwith the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate\nslightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of\ncritical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the\nhyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation\nand the critical exponents obtained for $N_z>1$ to calculate the dimension of\nthe system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be\nviewed as an \"effective\" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We\nalso show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while\nvarying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin\nfilm. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order\nparameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical\nexponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry\nbreakings.
