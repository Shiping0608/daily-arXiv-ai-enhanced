To address these, we propose a\nhybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with\nsurface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of\nMaxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar\npotentials ($\\mathbf{A}$-$\\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural\ncompatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to\nlow-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded\nregions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is\ndiscretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological\ninvariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured\nmeshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently\nsatisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain\ntruncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the\nSIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to\ntwo by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the\nvector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a\ncorresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is\nrepresented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form\nrepresentation. This novel treatment improves compatibility at the interface\nand significantly enhances numerical performance. The proposed hybrid method\nthus offers a unified, efficient, and physically consistent framework for\nsolving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in complex geometries\nand heterogeneous materials"}

In a departure\nfrom the 'decide-announce-defend' approach typically used to site energy\ninfrastructure, we develop a participatory design methodology for\ncollaboratively designing fusion energy facilities with prospective host\ncommunities. We present here our findings from a participatory design workshop\nthat brought together 22 community participants and 34 engineering students.\nOur analysis of the textual and visual data from this workshop shows a range of\ndesign values and decision-making criteria with 'integrity' and 'respect'\nranking highest among values and 'economic benefits' and 'environmental\nprotection/safety' ranking highest among decision-making criteria. Salient\ndesign themes that emerge across facility concepts include connecting the\nhistory and legacy of the community to the design of the facility, care for\nworkers, transparency and access to the facility, and health and safety of the\nhost community. Participants reported predominantly positive sentiments,\nexpressing joy and surprise as the workshop progressed from learning about\nfusion to designing the hypothetical facility. Our findings suggest that\ncarrying out participatory design in the early stages of technology development\ncan invite and make concrete public hopes and concerns, improve understanding\nof, and curiosity about, an emerging technology, build toward social license,\nand inform context-specific development of fusion energy facilities."}
