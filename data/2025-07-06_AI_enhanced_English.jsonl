To address these, we propose a\nhybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with\nsurface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of\nMaxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar\npotentials ($\\mathbf{A}$-$\\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural\ncompatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to\nlow-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded\nregions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is\ndiscretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological\ninvariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured\nmeshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently\nsatisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain\ntruncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the\nSIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to\ntwo by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the\nvector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a\ncorresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is\nrepresented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form\nrepresentation.
