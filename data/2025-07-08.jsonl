This paper approaches the description\nof these heat-flux instabilities in a novel manner using regularized Kappa\ndistributions (RKDs) to characterize the electron strahl. RKDs conform to the\nvelocity distributions with suprathermal tails observed in situ, and at the\nsame time allow for consistent macromodeling, based on their singularity-free\nmoments. In contrast, the complexity of RKD models makes the analytical kinetic\nformalism complicated and still inaccessible, and therefore, here heat-flux\ninstabilities are resolved using the advanced solver ALPS. Two primary types of\ninstabilities emerge depending on plasma conditions: the whistler and firehose\nheat-flux instabilities. The solver is successfully tested for the first time\nfor such instabilities by comparison with previous results for standard\ndistributions, such as Maxwellian and Kappa. Moreover, the new RKD results show\nthat idealized Maxwellian models can overrate or underestimate the effects of\nthese instabilities, and also show differences from those obtained for the\nstandard Kappa, which, for instance, underestimate the firehose heat-flux\ngrowth rates."}

In practical scenarios, the PDE\nevaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical\nnoise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate\nfrom loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can\nlead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical\noscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in\ndownstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To\ncorrect this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can\nautomatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model\nconstruction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors\nthe spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation\nin the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise.

In this research, GRAS/Geant4 simulations were\nperformed to characterise the count rates that a simple Cherenkov detector\ndesign would experience in a low Earth orbit, and we find that Cherenkov count\nrates due to most particle components vary significantly depending on many\ndifferent factors, including the location in the orbit, the date of the orbit,\nwhether or not the detector is within the van Allen belts, and whether or not a\nsolar particle event is occurring.

High-order methods such as the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme are attractive candidates for their\nnumerical approximation.

A popular counter measure to\nstabilize DG methods is the use of entropy-stable formulations based on\nsummation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The present paper aims to construct a\nrobust and efficient entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element\nmethod (DGSEM) of arbitrary order on heterogeneous, curvilinear grids composed\nof triangular and quadrilateral elements or hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral\nand pyramid elements. To the author's knowledge, with the exception of\nhexahedral and quadrilateral elements, entropy-stable DGSE operators have been\nconstructed exclusively for tetrahedral and triangular meshes. The extension of\nthe DGSEM to more complex element shapes is achieved by means of a collapsed\ncoordinate transformation.

The purely hyperbolic operator is extended to\nhyperbolic-parabolic problems by the use of a lifting procedure.

A\nunified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to\nfamilies of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP\ndynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization\nof orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers\nto planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde\norbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as\nbutterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo\nOrbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate\nthe method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized\ntrajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching\nit with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and\nunderlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families.\nFinally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid\nrefinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific\nneeds."}

This has motivated the development of reconstruction\nmethods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the\nnonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this\nwork, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a\nsimple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We\nimplement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the\nleast squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming\napproach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a\nvery small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by\nNewton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less\nmeasurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant\nradial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local\nminimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise.

Some results in this setting have been extended to\nsuper Ricci flows, revealing a unified approach to analysis on Ricci\nnonnegative manifolds and Ricci flows. However we observe that the monotonicity\nof Perelman's functionals ($\\mathcal{F}$, $\\mathcal{W}$, reduced volume), which\nhold true for Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, cannot be strictly\ngeneralized to super Ricci flows. In 2010 Buzano introduced a condition which\nstill generalizes Ricci flows and Ricci nonnegative manifolds, and on which\nPerelman's monotonicities do hold.
