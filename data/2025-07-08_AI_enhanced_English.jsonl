A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible\ncorrect model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard\ninformation criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.\n  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information\ncriterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\\mathcal{B}\n\\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of\ncandidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model\n($n_\\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance\nthreshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more\nparameters than necessary when comparing many models.\n  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for\nSDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,\ncross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model\nidentification and predictive capability.\n  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals\n($\\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\\sigma$), which can impair model learning\nand selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants\nof PASTIS, PASTIS-$\\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\\sigma$, thus extending the\napplicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.\n  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical\nmethodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with\nstochastic dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PASTIS is a new information criterion for selecting the simplest correct SDE/SPDE models from noisy data, outperforming AIC, BIC, CV, and SINDy.

This interpretation is consistent with its\nequivalence to Ricci nonnegativity on Perelman's infinite dimensional manifold.\n  More precisely, we prove that for smooth evolutions of Riemannian manifolds,\nthis condition is equivalent to a Bochner inequality (resembling Perelman's\nHarnack inequality but for the forward heat flow), a gradient estimate for the\nheat flow, a Wasserstein contraction along the adjoint heat flow, the convexity\nof a modified entropy along Wasserstein geodesics, and an Evolutionary\nVariational Inequality (EVI).
