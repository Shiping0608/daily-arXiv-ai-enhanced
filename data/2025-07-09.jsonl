A workflow\nfor parameter inference in the UEDGE fluid code is developed using Bayesian\noptimization with parallelized sampling and integrated uncertainty\nquantification. In this workflow, transport coefficients are inferred by\nmaximizing their posterior probability distribution, which is generally\nmultidimensional and non-Gaussian. Uncertainty quantification is integrated\nthroughout the optimization within the Bayesian framework that combines\ndiagnostic uncertainties and model limitations. As a concrete example, we infer\nthe anomalous electron thermal diffusivity $\\chi_\\perp$ from an interpretive\n2-D model describing electron heat transport in the conduction-limited region\nwith radiative power loss. The workflow is first benchmarked against synthetic\ndata and then tested on H-, L-, and I-mode discharges to match their midplane\ntemperature and divertor heat flux profiles.

The evaluation of objective and\nconstraint functions and their gradients is potentially computationally\nexpensive, but it is assumed that one can construct effective, computationally\ninexpensive models of these functions. This paper specifies how these models\ncan be used to generate new iterates. At each iteration, the models have to\nsatisfy function error and relative gradient error tolerances determined by the\nalgorithm based on its progress. Moreover, bounds for the model errors are used\nto explore regions where the combined objective function and constraint models\nare sufficiently accurate. The algorithm has the same first-order global\nconvergence properties as a line-search SQP algorithm with $\\ell_1$-merit\nfunction, but only uses objective and constraint function models and the model\nerror bounds. The algorithm is applied to a discretized boundary control\nproblem in which the evaluation of the objective and constraint functions\nrequires the solution of the Boussinesq partial differential equation (PDE).\nThe models are constructed from projection-based reduced-order models of the\nBoussinesq PDE."}
