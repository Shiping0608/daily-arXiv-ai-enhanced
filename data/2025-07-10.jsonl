The key novelty is that we establish a Morawetz type energy\nestimate for the perturbed inhomogeneous wave equation in the exterior domain,\nwhich yields $t^{-\\frac12}$ decay inside the cone. In addition, two new\nweighted $L^2$ product estimates are established to produce $t^{-\\frac12}$\ndecay close to the cone. We then show that the existence lifespan $T_\\e$ for\nthe quasilinear wave equations with general quadratic nonlinearity satisfies\n\\begin{equation*} \\varepsilon^2T_{\\varepsilon}\\ln^3T_{\\varepsilon}=A,\n\\end{equation*} for some fixed positive constant $A$, which is almost sharp\n(with some logarithmic loss) comparing to the known result of the corresponding\nCauchy problem."}
