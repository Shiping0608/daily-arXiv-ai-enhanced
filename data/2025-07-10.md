### [1] [A Family of Block-Centered Schemes for Contaminant Transport Equations with Adsorption via Integral Method with Variational Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06551)
*He Liu,Xiongbo Zheng,Xiaole Li,Mingze Ji*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces high-order conservative schemes for contaminant transport with equilibrium adsorption, using a unified framework to achieve fourth- to eighth-order accuracy. It analyzes stability, convergence, and mass conservation, and validates the schemes numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a versatile and accurate numerical framework for contaminant transport with equilibrium adsorption, addressing the need for high-order schemes and boundary treatments.

Method: Uses the Integral Method with Variational Limit on block-centered grids, incorporating four parameters to achieve fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order accuracy. Analyzes stability, convergence, and mass conservation under periodic boundary conditions.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the schemes' high-order accuracy and effectiveness across various adsorption models. Boundary treatments ensure uniform accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes are effective, versatile, and theoretically validated, with potential applications in contaminant transport modeling.

Abstract: This paper develops a class of high-order conservative schemes for
contaminant transport with equilibrium adsorption, based on the Integral Method
with Variational Limit on block-centered grids. By incorporating four
parameters, the scheme can reproduce classical fourth-order compact schemes and
further extend to sixth- and eighth-order accurate formulations, all within a
unified framework. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analyze the
stability, convergence, and mass conservation of the parameterized numerical
scheme. Numerical experiments are then conducted to examine the impact of
parameter variations on errors, explore the relationship between parameters and
the fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order schemes, and verify that the schemes'
high-order accuracy aligns with theoretical predictions. To enhance the
applicability of the proposed method, we further develop two fourth-order
compact boundary treatments that ensure uniform accuracy between boundary and
interior regions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
schemes across various adsorption models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scattered data approximation problems by reducing bias in multiscale approximations.

Result: Demonstrates effective bias reduction and consistent decay in various scenarios, including manifold-valued functions.

Conclusion: Multiscale approximation provides a flexible, robust framework for reducing bias in approximation errors.

Abstract: We study the bias-variance tradeoff within a multiscale approximation
framework. Our approach utilizes a given quasi-approximation operator,
repeatedly applied in an error-correction scheme over a hierarchical data
structure. We introduce a new bias measurement, the bias ratio, to
quantitatively assess the improvements made by multiscale approximations and
demonstrate that this multiscale strategy effectively reduces the bias
component of the approximation error, thereby providing a more flexible and
robust framework for addressing scattered data approximation problems. Our
findings exhibit consistent bias decay across various scenarios, including
applications to manifold-valued functions.

### [3] [Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731)
*Bernard Haasdonk,Gabriele Santin,Tizian Wenzel*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a kernel-based greedy method (PDE-β-greedy) for solving elliptic boundary value problems, achieving exponential convergence for infinitely smooth kernels and extending to parametric PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in approximating solutions of elliptic boundary value problems and parametric PDEs, especially for non-affine geometries, moving sources, or high-dimensional domains.

Method: Uses a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with a greedy selection criterion (PDE-β-greedy). Extends to parametric PDEs via state-parameter product kernels.

Result: Demonstrates exponential convergence for infinitely smooth kernels and efficient approximation for complex parametric problems.

Conclusion: The method is effective for challenging parametric problems without requiring precomputed snapshots, offering a priori model reduction.

Abstract: We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for
approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure
is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta
\geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of
function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for
Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a
result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth
kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the
case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the
surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a
priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be
precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation
procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR
procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or
high-dimensional domains.

### [5] [Sharp uniform approximation for spectral Barron functions by deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06789)
*Yulei Liao,Pingbing Ming,Hao Yu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work explores the neural network approximation capabilities for
functions within the spectral Barron space $\mathscr{B}^s$, where $s$ is the
smoothness index. We demonstrate that for functions in $\mathscr{B}^{1/2}$, a
shallow neural network (a single hidden layer) with $N$ units can achieve an
$L^p$-approximation rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. This rate also applies to
uniform approximation, differing by at most a logarithmic factor. Our results
significantly reduce the smoothness requirement compared to existing theory,
which necessitate functions to belong to $\mathscr{B}^1$ in order to attain the
same rate. Furthermore, we show that increasing the network's depth can notably
improve the approximation order for functions with small smoothness.
Specifically, for networks with $L$ hidden layers, functions in $\mathscr{B}^s$
with $0 < sL \le 1/2$ can achieve an approximation rate of
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-sL})$. The rates and prefactors in our estimates are
dimension-free. We also confirm the sharpness of our findings, with the lower
bound closely aligning with the upper, with a discrepancy of at most one
logarithmic factor.

Motivation: To address error estimation in thin plate vibration problems using virtual element methods for polygonal/polyhedral meshes.

Method: Conforming $C^1$ discrete formulation for polygonal/polyhedral meshes, with residual-based error estimation.

Result: Dimension-independent proof of reliability and efficiency; numerical experiments confirm optimal performance in 2D and 3D.

Conclusion: The method is effective for error estimation in thin plate vibration problems across dimensions.

Abstract: We propose and analyse residual-based a posteriori error estimates for the
virtual element discretisation applied to the thin plate vibration problem in
both two and three dimensions. Our approach involves a conforming $C^1$
discrete formulation suitable for meshes composed of polygons and polyhedra.
The reliability and efficiency of the error estimator are established through a
dimension-independent proof. Finally, several numerical experiments are
reported to demonstrate the optimal performance of the method in 2D and 3D.

### [7] [An overlapping domain decomposition method for parametric Stokes and Stokes-Darcy problems via proper generalized decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06861)
*Marco Discacciati,Ben J. Evans,Matteo Giacomini*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A method (DD-PGD) combines proper generalized decomposition and domain decomposition to create efficient local surrogate models for parametric Stokes and Stokes-Darcy systems, outperforming traditional high-fidelity solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency in solving parametric Stokes and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems.

Method: Uses PGD for dimensionality reduction and overlapping domain decomposition to minimize globally coupled degrees of freedom. Non-intrusive, leveraging existing discretization matrices.

Result: Demonstrates accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, outperforming high-fidelity finite element solvers.

Conclusion: DD-PGD is a versatile and efficient approach for parametric flow problems, compatible with various discretization schemes.

Abstract: A strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric
Stokes flows and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems is presented. The methodology
relies on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method to reduce the
dimensionality of the parametric flow fields and on an overlapping domain
decomposition (DD) paradigm to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of
freedom in space. The DD-PGD approach provides a non-intrusive framework in
which end-users only need access to the matrices arising from the (finite
element) discretization of the full-order problems in the subdomains. The
traces of the finite element functions used for the discretization within the
subdomains are employed to impose arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at
the interface, without introducing auxiliary basis functions. The methodology
is seamless to the choice of the discretization schemes in space, being
compatible with both LBB-compliant finite element pairs and stabilized
formulations, and the DD-PGD paradigm is transparent to the employed
overlapping DD approach. The local surrogate models are glued together in the
online phase by solving a parametric interface system to impose continuity of
the subdomain solutions at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange
multipliers to enforce the continuity in the entire overlap and without solving
any additional physical problem in the reduced space. Numerical results are
presented for parametric single-physics (Stokes-Stokes) and multi-physics
(Stokes-Darcy) systems, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and computational
efficiency of DD-PGD, and its capability to outperform DD methods based on
high-fidelity finite element solvers in terms of computing times.

### [8] [Structure-preserving space discretization of differential and nonlocal constitutive relations for port-Hamiltonian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06869)
*Antoine Bendimerad-Hohl,Ghislain Haine,Laurent Lefèvre,Denis Matignon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents a structure-preserving discretization method for port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems using Stokes-Lagrange structures, applied to 1D and 2D models, preserving energy properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for discretizing pH systems with differential constitutive relations while preserving their structural and energetic properties.

Method: Uses Stokes-Lagrange structures and a structure-preserving Finite Element Method to reduce systems to finite-dimensional pH forms. Applied to 1D nanorod, shear beam, and 2D Navier-Stokes models.

Result: The discretization preserves enstrophy and kinetic energy in semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels, validated theoretically and numerically.

Conclusion: The method successfully preserves structural and energetic properties of pH systems across various models, demonstrating its robustness and applicability.

Abstract: We study the structure-preserving space discretization of port-Hamiltonian
(pH) systems defined with differential constitutive relations. Using the
concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are
reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a
structure-preserving Finite Element Method.
  To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are
considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations
for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports
naturally occur.
  Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It
is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along
with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space
discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system.
Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy
evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.

### [9] [A new class of one-step A-stable and L-stable schemes of high-order accuracy for parabolic type equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06985)
*Xiaoyi Li,Aijie Cheng,Zhengguang Liu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces high-order one-step schemes for linear parabolic equations, improving on multi-step BDF methods by achieving A-stability or L-stability with tunable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of multi-step BDF schemes, the authors aim to develop more practical one-step methods with high-order accuracy and stability.

Method: Constructs new one-step schemes using Taylor expansions at tunable time points (β_i) and explores two techniques: parameter selection and adding intermediate layers.

Result: The schemes achieve A-stability or L-stability, with some resembling stabilized Runge-Kutta methods. Numerical experiments confirm effectiveness and superconvergence.

Conclusion: The proposed one-step schemes outperform traditional BDF methods in stability and practicality, validated by numerical results.

Abstract: Recently, a new class of BDF schemes proposed in [F. Huang and J. Shen, SIAM
J Numer. Anal., 62.4, 1609--1637] for the parabolic type equations are studied
in this paper. The basic idea is based on the Taylor expansions at time
$t^{n+\beta}$ with $\beta>1$ being a tunable parameter. These new BDF schemes
allow larger time steps at higher order r for stiff problems than that which
allowed with a usual higher-order scheme. However, multi-step methods like BDF
exhibit inherent disadvantages relative to one-step methods in practical
implementations. In this paper, inspired by their excellent work, we construct
a new class of high-order one-step schemes for linear parabolic-type equations.
These new schemes, with several suitable $\beta_i$, can achieve A-stable, or
even L-stable. Specially, the new scheme with special parameters $\beta_i$ can
be regarded as the classical one-step Runge-Kutta scheme with a stabilized
term. Besides, we provide two different techniques to construct the one-step
high-order schemes: the first one is by choosing different parameters
$\beta_i$, and the second one is by increasing the number of intermediate
layers. Both methods have been proven to be highly effective and even exhibit
superconvergence property. Finally, we also conducted several numerical
experiments to support our conclusions.

### [10] [Energetic Derivation and Geometric Reduction of Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Holling-Type Functional Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06319)
*Jan-Eric Sulzbach*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper derives multi-species reaction-diffusion systems using the Energetic Variational Approach, linking thermodynamics with ecological models and analyzing asymptotic regimes to recover Holling-type functional responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge thermodynamic consistency with ecological modeling and provide a framework for studying multi-scale reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Method: Uses the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) and generalized geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) for PDEs.

Result: Derives Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics and Holling-type functional responses, proving the existence of attracting slow manifolds.

Conclusion: The framework robustly connects thermodynamics with ecological models and enables analysis of multi-scale dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents an energetic derivation of a class of multi-species
reaction-diffusion systems incorporating various functional responses, with a
focus on and application to ecological models. Starting point is a closed
reaction network for which we apply the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA)
to derive the corresponding reaction-diffusion system. This framework captures
both diffusion and nonlinear reaction kinetics, and recovers
Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics with species-dependent interactions. Moreover, we
find an open subsystem embedded into the larger closed system, that contains
the physical and ecological important quantities. By analyzing different
asymptotic regimes in the reaction parameters of the resulting system, we
formally derive classical Holling type I, II, and III functional responses. To
rigorously justify these reductions and their dynamical properties, we apply
the generalized geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) for PDEs and
prove the existence of an attracting and invariant slow manifolds near the
critical manifold of the reduced system. Our analysis not only bridges
thermodynamic consistency with ecological modeling but also provides a robust
framework to study the dynamics of slow manifolds in multi-scale
reaction-diffusion systems.

### [12] [Bifurcation Analysis, Modulational Instability and Solitons Solutions for a Coupled Nonlinear Schrödinger-Type Equations with Variable Coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06431)
*J. M. Escorcia*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study explores nonlinear dynamics of a novel coupled nonlinear Schrödinger system with variable coefficients, revealing solitonic structures, stability, and chaotic tendencies under perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand, predict, and control physical processes by analyzing PDE dynamics, focusing on a novel coupled nonlinear Schrödinger system.

Method: Analyzed traveling-wave solutions using bifurcation theory, conducted sensitivity analysis for stability, and tested under perturbations.

Result: Discovered Jacobi elliptic functions, solitonic structures, and modulational instability under specific parameter configurations.

Conclusion: The system exhibits rich dynamics, including stability and chaos, with potential implications for controlling physical processes.

Abstract: Understanding, predicting, and controlling physical processes often relies on
the analysis of the dynamics of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this
context, the present study offers an in-depth investigation into the nonlinear
dynamics of a novel coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with variable
coefficients. To begin with, the dynamics of traveling-wave solutions is
analyzed through bifurcation theory, which uncovers the presence of Jacobi
elliptic functions and solitonic structures. Then, a sensitivity analysis is
carried out to confirm the numerical relevance and stability of these
solutions. However, when subjected to external perturbations, the system
exhibits a tendency toward chaotic behavior. Finally, the results point to the
emergence of modulational instability under specific configurations of the
dispersion and nonlinearity parameters.

### [13] [Decay of small energy solutions in the ABCD Boussinesq model under the influence of an uneven bottom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06487)
*Christopher Maulén,Claudio Muñoz,Felipe Poblete*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper generalizes previous work on the Hamiltonian ABCD Boussinesq systems by analyzing small data decay in a variable bottom regime, proving global solution existence and decay properties for a specific set of systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of decay properties in the Boussinesq $abcd$ system, particularly in the physically relevant variable bottom regime, and to generalize prior results.

Method: The study considers a smooth space-time dependent function for bathymetry, proves global solution existence in $H^1\times H^1$, and analyzes decay properties for a specific set of dispersive $abcd$ systems.

Result: Existence of small global solutions in $H^1\times H^1$ is proven, and decay to zero within a subset of the light cone is shown for certain systems.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes prior results, providing insights into decay properties of the Boussinesq $abcd$ system in a variable bottom regime.

Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in
$\mathbb{R}_t\times\mathbb{R}_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as
first order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two
dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the
spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among many particular regimes,
depending each of them in terms of the value of the parameters $(a,b,c,d)$
present in the equations, the generic regime is characterized by the setting
$b,d>0$ and $a,c<0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is hamiltonian.
Previously, sharp local in space $H^1\times H^1$ decay properties were proved
in the case of a large class of $abcd$ model under the small data assumption.
In this paper, we generalize [C. Kwak, et. al., The scattering problem for
Hamiltonian ABCD Boussinesq systems in the energy space. J. Math. Pures Appl.
(9) 127 (2019), 121--159] by considering the small data $abcd$ decay problem in
the physically relevant variable bottom regime described by M. Chen. The
nontrivial bathymetry is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function
$h=h(t,x)$, which obeys integrability in time and smallness in space. We prove
first the existence of small global solutions in $H^1\times H^1$. Then, for a
sharp set of dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of
parameters $a, b$ and $c$), all $H^1\times H^1$ small solutions must decay to
zero in proper subset of the light cone $|x|\leq |t|$.

### [14] [Analysis of Reaction-Diffusion Predator-Prey System under Random Switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06491)
*Nguyen H. Du,Nhu N. Nguyen*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a predator-prey system with random environmental fluctuations using a hybrid PDE model under Markovian switching. It identifies a critical threshold for species persistence and describes long-term behavior, supported by numerical simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how random environmental fluctuations, modeled by Markovian switching, impact the long-term dynamics and coexistence of predator-prey systems in a spatial context.

Method: A hybrid system of PDEs is used, incorporating Markovian switching to model environmental randomness. Theoretical analysis derives a critical threshold and characterizes asymptotic behavior. Numerical simulations validate findings.

Result: A critical threshold determines species persistence or extinction. The analysis reveals how random switching influences species distribution and long-term coexistence.

Conclusion: This work bridges spatial ecology and stochastic hybrid PDE systems, providing the first rigorous analysis of such a model under Markovian switching.

Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term dynamics of a reaction-diffusion
predator-prey system subject to random environmental fluctuations modeled by
Markovian switching. The model is formulated as a hybrid system of partial
differential equations (PDEs), where the switching between different ecological
regimes captures the randomness in environmental conditions. We derive a
critical threshold parameter that determines whether the predator species will
eventually go extinct or persist. We further characterize the system's
asymptotic behavior by providing a detailed pathwise description of the
omega-limit set of solutions. This analysis reveals how the effects of random
switching shape the distribution and long-term coexistence of the species.
Numerical simulations are provided to validate and illustrate the theoretical
findings, highlighting transitions between different dynamical regimes. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously analyzes a
spatially diffusive predator-prey model under Markovian switching, thereby
bridging the gap between spatial ecology and stochastic hybrid PDE systems.

epsilon-isometries, which allows us to pass to the Gromov--Hausdorff limit
without embedding the spaces into a common ambient space. As a byproduct, we
give a PDE-based proof of the stability of the dual Kantorovich problems under
measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of gas-liquid two-phase flows in unbounded domains and establish regularity estimates for the evolution problem.

Method: Constructs an R-solver for the resolvent problem of the gas-liquid two-phase operator, analyzing explicit resolvent operators in unbounded domains with flat boundaries.

Result: Successfully establishes maximal L_p-L_q regularity estimates for the evolution problem.

Conclusion: The analysis of resolvent operators in unbounded domains is key to solving the evolution equations for gas-liquid two-phase flows.

Abstract: This paper studies some evolution equations arising from the sharp interface
problem of the compressible-incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in unbounded
domains in $\mathbb{R}^N (N\geq2)$, where the viscous gases initially occupy
the upper half space and the viscous liquids below initially lie in the
strip-like domain. In order to establish the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity
estimates of the evolution problem, we construct the R-solver of the resolvent
problem associated to the gas-liquid two-phase operator. The crucial part of
our proof lies in the analysis of the explicit resolvent operators defined in
the unbounded domains with flat boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the identifiability and stability of variable-order parameters in subdiffusion models, which is crucial for accurate modeling and inversion.

Method: Uses resolvent estimates in $L^r(\Omega)$ spaces, Laplace domain solution representation, and asymptotic expansions of the Laplace transform of boundary flux at specific points.

Result: Establishes unique identifiability results from single-point boundary observations and conditional Lipschitz stability for full-boundary observations.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations for recovering variable-order parameters in subdiffusion models, enhancing their practical applicability.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the unique identifiability and stable recovery of
a spatially dependent variable-order in the subdiffusion model from the
boundary flux measurement. We establish several new unique identifiability
results from the observation at one point on the boundary without / with the
knowledge of medium properties, and a conditional Lipschitz stability when the
observation is available on the whole boundary. The analysis crucially employs
resolvent estimates in $L^r(\Omega)$, $r>2$, spaces, solution representation in
the Laplace domain and novel asymptotic expansions of the Laplace transform of
the boundary flux at $p= 0$ and $p=1$.

Namely, the main result establishes that the unknown potential can be H\"older
stably retrieved from the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the
sequence of the boundary measurements of the corresponding eigenfunctions where
finitely many terms are missing.

*Tatsu-Hiko Miura*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper estimates the difference between weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations on a 3D thin spherical shell and a 2D unit sphere using a weak-strong uniqueness approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how weak solutions on a thin spherical shell compare to those on a unit sphere, leveraging the energy inequality and Leray-Hopf solutions.

Method: Extends the weak solution on the unit sphere to an approximate solution on the shell, then applies the weak-strong uniqueness argument.

Result: Derives difference estimates between the two weak solutions.

Conclusion: The weak-strong uniqueness argument effectively estimates solution differences, validating the approach for such geometries.

Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional thin spherical
shell and on the two-dimensional unit sphere, and estimate the difference of
weak solutions on the thin spherical shell and the unit sphere. Assuming that
the weak solution on the thin spherical shell is a Leray-Hopf weak solution
satisfying the energy inequality, we derive difference estimates for the two
weak solutions by the weak-strong uniqueness argument. The main idea is to
extend the weak solution on the unit sphere properly to an approximate solution
on the thin spherical shell, and to use the extension as a strong solution in
the weak-strong uniqueness argument.

TL;DR: Study of an inverse problem for a wave equation with fractional derivatives, proving local existence, uniqueness, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the solvability of an inverse problem involving a potential coefficient in a wave equation with fractional derivatives.

Method: Uses Fourier decomposition for the direct problem and fixed point theorem in a Banach space for the inverse problem.

Result: Local existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution are established.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the inverse problem under study.

Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of determining a potential
coefficient in an abstract wave equation that includes a lower-order term. The
equation incorporates a time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense, as well
as a fractional power of an abstract operator defined on a Hilbert space. Using
the Fourier decomposition method, we analyze the solvability of the direct
problem. Leveraging the properties of the solution to the direct problem, we
conduct an examination of the inverse problem. By applying the fixed point
theorem within a suitable Banach space, we derive results concerning the local
existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution.

Motivation: To understand the behavior of the 3D-rotating MHD system under strong rotation when initial conditions have a 2D component.

Method: Uses weak and strong solutions, adapted Strichartz estimates, and an additional 3D magnetic field transported by the 2D limit velocity.

Result: The limit system is a 2D-MHD system with three components, and explicit global-in-time convergence rates are derived.

Conclusion: The study successfully characterizes the limit system and provides convergence rates, enhancing understanding of MHD systems under strong rotation.

Abstract: In this article, we consider the 3D-rotating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system
when the initial velocity and magnetic field both feature some 2D-part (i.-e.
depending only on the horizontal space variables). We prove for weak and strong
solutions, that the limit system, when the Rossby number goes to zero (i.-e.
for strong rotation), is a 2D-MHD system with three components. Moreover we are
able to provide explicit global-in-time convergence rates thanks to adapted
Strichartz estimates and with the help of an additional 3D magnetic field
transported by the 2D limit velocity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of solutions to complex anisotropic parabolic equations, particularly their positivity and oscillation properties.

Result: Demonstrates expansion of positivity and reduction of oscillation for solutions, with separate treatments for singular and degenerate scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the diffusion competition in anisotropic equations, offering tools for analyzing their solutions.

Abstract: We prove expansion of positivity and reduction of the oscillation results to
the local weak solutions to a doubly nonlinear anisotropic class of parabolic
differential equations with bounded and measurable coefficients, whose
prototype is \begin{equation*} u_t-\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \left(
u^{(m_i-1)(p_i-1)} \ |u_{x_i}|^{p_i-2} \ u_{x_i} \right)_{x_i}=0 ,
\end{equation*} for a restricted range of $p_i$s and $m_i$s, that reflects
their competition for the diffusion. The positivity expansion relies on an
exponential shift and is presented separately for singular and degenerate
cases. Finally we present a study of the local oscillation of the solution for
some specific ranges of exponents, within the singular and degenerate cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive an optimal Hardy-weight for the fractional Laplacian on the discrete half-line, improving existing results and applications in fractional Schrödinger equations.

Method: Analyze Hardy inequalities for the fractional Laplacian, derive optimal Hardy-weight, and compare with classical results.

Result: Optimal Hardy-weight outperforms classical results, especially for σ=1, and enables unique continuation at infinity.

Conclusion: The derived Hardy-weight enhances fractional Hardy inequalities and supports unique continuation in fractional Schrödinger equations.

Abstract: In the context of Hardy inequalities for the fractional Laplacian
$(-\Delta_{\mathbb{N}})^{\sigma}$ on the discrete half-line $\mathbb{N}$, we
provide an optimal Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{\sigma}$ for exponents
$\sigma\in\left(0,1\right]$. As a consequence, we provide an estimate of the
sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality with the classical
Hardy-weight $n^{-2\sigma}$ on $\mathbb{N}$. It turns out that for $\sigma =1$
the Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{1}$ is pointwise larger than the optimal
Hardy-weight obtained by Keller--Pinchover--Pogorzelski near infinity. As an
application of our main result, we obtain unique continuation results at
infinity for the solutions of some fractional Schr\"odinger equation.

*Kenta Kumagai*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new nonlinearity for the Gelfand problem, showing that bifurcation curves can have infinitely many turning points even when growth rates exceed the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity, challenging previous assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and classify bifurcation structures in the Gelfand problem beyond the known behavior tied to growth rates of nonlinearities.

Method: Introduces a new type of nonlinearity and provides a general criterion to determine bifurcation structures, including classification.

Result: Demonstrates that bifurcation curves can exhibit infinitely many turning points even when growth rates surpass the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity.

Conclusion: The bifurcation structure is not solely determined by growth rate comparisons, requiring a broader criterion for classification.

Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with Sobolev supercritical nonlinearities $f$
in the unit ball. In the case where $f$ is a power type nonlinearity or the
exponential nonlinearity, it is well-known that the bifurcation curve has
infinitely many turning points when the growth rate of $f$ is smaller than that
of the specific nonlinearity (called the Joseph-Lundgren critical
nonlinearity), while the bifurcation curve has no turning point when the growth
rate of $f$ is greater than or equal to that of the Joseph-Lundgren critical
nonlinearity.
  In this paper, we give a new type of nonlinearity $f$ such that the growth
rate is greater than or equal to that of the Joseph-Lundgren critical
nonlinearity, while the bifurcation curve has infinitely many turning points.
This result shows that the bifurcation structure is not determined solely by
the comparison between the growth rate of $f$ and that of the Joseph-Lundgren
critical nonlinearity. In fact, we find a general criterion which determines
the bifurcation structure; and give a classification of the bifurcation
structure.

### [26] [On surface energies in scaling laws for singular perturbation problems for martensitic phase transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06773)
*Angkana Rüland,Camillo Tissot,Antonio Tribuzio,Christian Zillinger*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper compares surface energies in multi-well singular perturbation problems for martensitic phase transformations, showing robust scaling laws regardless of surface energy type or anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different surface energies affect scaling laws in higher-order laminates, especially given experimental challenges in determining precise surface energy structures.

Method: Analyzes scaling laws in the singular perturbation parameter for various surface energies (diffuse, sharp, interpolated, discrete) and examines the role of anisotropy.

Result: Scaling laws are robust across surface energy types and anisotropies, with only the innermost lamination direction significantly impacting the scaling.

Conclusion: The precise structure of surface energies is not crucial for scaling behavior in higher-order laminates, simplifying experimental applications.

Abstract: The objective of this article is to compare different surface energies for
multi-well singular perturbation problems associated with martensitic phase
transformations involving higher order laminates. We deduce scaling laws in the
singular perturbation parameter which are robust in the choice of the surface
energy (e.g., diffuse, sharp, an interpolation thereof or discrete).
Furthermore, we show that these scaling laws do not require the presence of
isotropic surface energies but that generically also highly anisotropic surface
energies yield the same scaling results. More precisely, the presence of
essentially generic partial directional derivatives in the regularization terms
suffices to produce the same scaling behaviour as in the isotropic setting. The
only sensitive directional dependences are directly linked to the lamination
directions of the well structure -- and even for these only the ``inner-most''
lamination direction is of significance in determining the scaling law. In view
of experimental applications, this shows that also for higher-order laminates,
the precise structure of the surface energies -- which is often very difficult
to determine experimentally -- does not have a crucial impact on the scaling
behaviour of the investigated structures but only enters when considering finer
properties.

*Lucas Broux,Harprit Singh,Rhys Steele*

TL;DR: The paper extends convergence results for renormalised models in regularity structures to variable coefficient singular SPDEs, introducing renormalisation functions and proving their locality and continuous dependence on coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize previous results on renormalised models for singular SPDEs beyond the translation-invariant setting, addressing the need for renormalisation functions in variable coefficient cases.

Method: Uses regularity structures framework, introduces renormalisation functions, and proves their locality and continuity under general assumptions, including second-order parabolic operators.

Result: Demonstrates that renormalisation functions can be chosen locally and depend continuously on the coefficient field, extending prior work.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes convergence results for renormalised models to variable coefficient singular SPDEs, providing a foundation for broader applications.

Abstract: In this work we prove convergence of renormalised models in the framework of
regularity structures [Hai14] for a wide class of variable coefficient singular
SPDEs in their full subcritical regimes. In particular, we provide for the
first time an extension of the main results of [CH16, HS24, BH23] beyond the
translation invariant setting. In the non-translation invariant setting, it is
necessary to introduce renormalisation functions rather than renormalisation
constants. We show that under a very general assumption, which we prove covers
the case of second order parabolic operators, these renormalisation functions
can be chosen to be local in the sense that their space-time dependence enters
only through a finite order jet of the coefficient field of the differential
operator at the given space-time point. Furthermore we show that the models we
construct depend continuously on the coefficient field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine the Kuznecov sum formula by improving remainder estimates for period integrals of Laplace eigenfunctions.

Method: Building on a prior two-term asymptotic expansion, the study focuses on a Baire-generic class of metrics to eliminate the oscillatory second term.

Result: For generic metrics, the oscillatory second term is eliminated, leading to an improved remainder estimate.

Conclusion: The work provides a refined understanding of the Kuznecov formula, particularly for generic metrics, by simplifying its structure and improving estimates.

Abstract: We obtain improved remainder estimates in the Kuznecov sum formula for period
integrals of Laplace eigenfunctions on a Riemannian manifold $M$. Building upon
the two-term asymptotic expansion established in [arXiv:2204.13525], we prove
that for a Baire-generic class of metrics, the oscillatory second term in the
Kuznecov formula can be eliminated, yielding an improved remainder estimate.

TL;DR: Study of well-posedness in Sobolev spaces for incompressible Euler equations in an infinite strip with non-flat bottom and free-surface, including vorticity and density variations. Extends water waves equations and justifies convergence to non-linear shallow water equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the well-studied water waves equations by including density variations and vorticity, while tracking shallow water parameter dependency.

Method: Analysis of well-posedness in Sobolev spaces, leveraging existing results for water waves and non-linear shallow water equations.

Result: Proves well-posedness for free-surface Euler equations on a logarithmic time-scale in a suitable regime.

Conclusion: The study justifies the convergence to non-linear shallow water equations and provides existence results for the free-surface Euler equations.

Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness in Sobolev spaces of the
incompressible Euler equations in an infinite strip delimited from below by a
non-flat bottom and from above by a free-surface. We allow the presence of
vorticity and density variations, and in these regards the present system is an
extension of the well-studied water waves equations. When the bottom is flat
and with no density variations (but when the flow is not necessarily
irrotational), our study provides an alternative proof of the already known
large-time well-posedness results for the water waves equations. Our main
contribution is that we allow for the presence of density variations, while
also keeping track of the dependency in the shallow water parameter. This
allows us to justify the convergence from the free-surface Euler equations
towards the non-linear shallow water equations in this setting. Using an
already established large time existence result for these latter equations, we
also prove the existence of the free-surface Euler equations on a logarithmic
time-scale, in a suitable regime.

TL;DR: The paper studies long-time existence for small data solutions of quasilinear wave equations in 2D exterior to star-shaped regions, establishing decay rates and lifespan estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend understanding of quasilinear wave equations in exterior domains, particularly for small data solutions, and improve decay estimates.

Method: Uses a Morawetz-type energy estimate for perturbed inhomogeneous wave equations and introduces two new weighted $L^2$ product estimates.

Result: Achieves $t^{-\frac12}$ decay inside and near the cone, with lifespan estimate $\varepsilon^2 T_\varepsilon \ln^3 T_\varepsilon = A$.

Conclusion: The results are nearly sharp, with a logarithmic loss compared to the Cauchy problem, advancing the analysis of quasilinear wave equations in exterior domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time existence result for small data
solutions of quasilinear wave equations exterior to star-shaped regions in two
space dimensions. The key novelty is that we establish a Morawetz type energy
estimate for the perturbed inhomogeneous wave equation in the exterior domain,
which yields $t^{-\frac12}$ decay inside the cone. In addition, two new
weighted $L^2$ product estimates are established to produce $t^{-\frac12}$
decay close to the cone. We then show that the existence lifespan $T_\e$ for
the quasilinear wave equations with general quadratic nonlinearity satisfies
\begin{equation*} \varepsilon^2T_{\varepsilon}\ln^3T_{\varepsilon}=A,
\end{equation*} for some fixed positive constant $A$, which is almost sharp
(with some logarithmic loss) comparing to the known result of the corresponding
Cauchy problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve shape optimization problems for spectral quantities of specific operators, aiming to find optimal domains for minimizing eigenvalues and maximizing torsional rigidity.

Method: Analyzes operators of the form Δ²−τΔ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using Szegő-type and Saint-Venant-type inequalities to establish optimality of the ball.

Result: The ball minimizes the first eigenvalue for domains with fixed-sign eigenfunctions and maximizes torsional rigidity, providing sharp bounds.

Conclusion: The ball is the optimal shape for the studied problems, and additional properties and optimality conditions for eigenvalue minimization are presented.

Abstract: We address extremum problems for spectral quantities associated with
operators of the form $\Delta^2-\tau\Delta$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions,
for non-negative values of $\tau$. The focus is on two shape optimisation
problems: minimising the first eigenvalue; and maximising the torsional
rigidity, both under volume constraint. We establish, on the one hand, a
Szeg\H{o}-type inequality, that is, we show that among all domains having a
first eigenfunction of fixed sign the ball minimises the corresponding first
eigenvalue; on the other hand a Saint--Venant-type inequality, namely, a sharp
upper bound on the torsional rigidity, again achieved by the ball. We further
present other properties related to these operators and express the optimality
condition associated with the minimisation of the first eigenvalue.

TL;DR: A deep neural network (DNN) using a U-Net architecture is proposed for fast and accurate prediction of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time significantly compared to traditional methods like LES.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate wind flow prediction in urban areas is vital for pedestrian comfort and urban design, but traditional methods are costly and time-consuming.

Method: A U-Net model trained on LES data from 252 synthetic urban configurations predicts mean velocity magnitude and turbulence intensity. Inputs include 2D building representations with signed distance functions.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy with mean relative errors of 9.3% for velocity and 5.2% for turbulence, reducing computation time from hours to seconds.

Conclusion: Deep learning offers a fast, accurate alternative for urban wind assessments, supporting safer and more sustainable urban environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wind flow fields in urban canopies is crucial for
ensuring pedestrian comfort, safety, and sustainable urban design. Traditional
methods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy
Simulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time
requirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast
and accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time
from an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1
second on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture
trained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind
directions ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two
key quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence
intensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D
building representations augmented with signed distance functions and their
gradients as inputs, forming a $256\times256\times9$ tensor. In addition, a
Spatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections.
The loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their
gradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases
demonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for
velocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity. This research shows the
potential of deep learning approaches to provide fast, accurate urban wind
assessments essential for creating comfortable and safe urban environments.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper adapts Ewald summation methods from molecular dynamics to improve the efficiency of vortex filament simulations, achieving O(N log N) complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive methods for simulating turbulent vortex flows are inefficient for large numbers of vortex elements, necessitating a better approach.

Method: The Biot-Savart law is analogized to electrostatics to apply Ewald summation, splitting velocity into coarse-grained and short-range components, evaluated using nonuniform fast Fourier transform.

Result: The method achieves O(N log N) complexity, verified through numerical experiments, and maintains accuracy and conservation properties.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly outperforms naive methods, making it suitable for large-scale vortex simulations.

Abstract: The Biot-Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including
electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a
fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes
the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The
Biot-Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of
classical and quantum fluid flows. Naive methods are inefficient when dealing
with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for
simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the
Biot-Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely
used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in
three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split
the induced velocity onto (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a
Gaussian-filtered vorticity field, and (ii) a short-range correction accounting
for near-singular behaviour near the vortices. The former component can be
accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier
transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function
of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account
for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical
experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the
proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of the
method over a wide range of problem sizes $N$, considerably better than the
$O(N^2)$ cost of a naive approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of large, complex X-ray free-electron lasers by leveraging ultra-bright electron beams from plasma wakefield accelerators.

Method: Start-to-end simulations demonstrate ultra-low-emittance electron beams from a plasma photocathode, balanced by space-charge forces, and focused into a metre-scale undulator.

Result: Produces wavelength-tunable, coherent, femtosecond X-ray pulses with millijoule-gigawatt-class power across the water window.

Conclusion: This approach democratizes access to high-power, coherent soft X-ray radiation, offering robustness and tunability.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers are large and complex machines, limited by
electron beam brightness. Here we show through start-to-end simulations how to
realise compact, robust and tunable X-ray lasers in the water window, based on
ultra-bright electron beams from plasma wakefield accelerators. First, an
ultra-low-emittance electron beam is released by a plasma photocathode in a
metre-scale plasma wakefield accelerator. By tuning the beam charge,
space-charge forces create a balance between beam fields and wakefields that
reduces beam energy spread and improves energy stability - both critical for
beam extraction, transport, and focusing into a metre-scale undulator. Here,
the resulting ultra-bright beams produce wavelength-tunable, coherent,
femtosecond scale photon pulses at ultra-high gain. This regime enables
reliable generation of millijoule-gigawatt-class X-ray laser pulses across the
water window, offering tunability via the witness beam charge and robustness
against variations in plasma wakefield strength. Our findings help democratise
access to coherent, high-power, soft X-ray radiation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the interplay between 3D shaping, equilibrium properties, and B in quasisymmetric MHS equations, which are nonlinear and overdetermined.

Method: Combines analysis and regression on a dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators.

Result: Demonstrates that B on a flux surface is determined by three or four flux functions, each a critical value of B's derivative along the field line.

Conclusion: The findings are global, consistent with near-axis models, and applicable even on the last closed flux surface.

Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a hidden symmetry of the magnetic field strength, B,
that enables effective confinement of charged particles in a fully
three-dimensional (3D) toroidal plasma equilibrium. Such equilibria are
typically modeled by the ideal magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equation. The
nonlinear, overdetermined nature of the quasisymmetric MHS equations severely
complicates our understanding of the interplay between 3D shaping, equilibrium
properties such as pressure and rotational transform, and B. Progress has been
made through expansions near the magnetic axis; however, a more comprehensive
theory is desirable. Using a combination of analysis and regression on a large
dataset of numerically optimized quasisymmetric stellarators, we demonstrate
that there is a hidden lower dimensionality of B on a magnetic flux surface
with connections to the theory of periodic solitons. We show that $B$ on a flux
surface is determined by three or at most four flux functions, each of which is
a critical value of the derivative of B along the field line. While being
consistent with the near-axis models, our results are global and hold even on
the last closed flux surface.

Method: Direct numerical simulations to calculate shell-to-shell energy transfer rates in b-to-b and j-to-b channels, analyzing local and non-local interactions.

Result: Local inverse transfer in b-to-b channel; j-to-b channel transitions from weak inverse to strong direct cascade. Non-local triads mediate significant local transfers, especially in small-scale j-to-b.

Abstract: A systematic study of inertial energy cascade in three-dimensional Hall
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is conducted to probe into the locality of
energy conserving triads and the subsequent transfers. Using direct numerical
simulations, we calculate the shell-to-shell energy transfer rates
corresponding to b-to-b (magnetic to magnetic) and j-to-b (current to magnetic)
channels due to the Hall term, and convincingly show that both channels
comprise of a combination of local and non-local energy transfers. A local
inverse transfer is consistently observed at all scales of the b-to-b channel
whereas for the j-to-b channel, the transfer due to local interactions shows a
transition from a weak inverse to a strong direct cascade across the Hall
scale. Calculating mediator-specific transfer rates, we also conclude that a
considerable amount of local energy transfer is mediated by the non-local
triads, especially at small-scales of j-to-b transfer. Assuming power-laws for
the modal fields, we offer heuristic arguments for some of our observed
results. The present study captures the intricate dynamics of energy transfer
due to the Hall term and hence can be used to develop more insightful
analytical models (shell models for example) for Hall magnetohydrodynamic
cascade and to carefully segregate the local and the non-local heating in the
space plasmas.

*Zisu Zhao*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend gradient estimates and inequalities to nonlinear parabolic equations on Finsler manifolds with mixed weighted Ricci curvature bounds.

Method: Uses a new Laplacian comparison theorem to derive a Li-Yau type gradient estimate for the Finslerian logarithmic Schrödinger equation.

Result: Establishes a Harnack inequality and a priori estimates for positive solutions of the equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of known examples of stable proper weak biharmonic maps from compact domains, particularly for higher dimensions.

Method: Constructs explicit maps and derives a second variation formula for bienergy to analyze stability.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of stable proper biharmonic maps to Euclidean spheres.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational examples and tools for studying biharmonic maps in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We construct an explicit family of stable proper weak biharmonic maps from
the unit ball $B^m$, $m\geq 5$, to Euclidean spheres. To the best of the
authors knowledge this is the first example of a stable proper weak biharmonic
map from at compact domain. To achieve our result we first establish the second
variation formula of the bienergy for maps from the unit ball into a Euclidean
sphere. Employing this result, we examine the stability of the proper weak
biharmonic maps $q:B^m\to\mathbb{S}^{m^{\ell}}$, $m,\ell\in\mathbb{N}$ with
$\ell\leq m$, which we recently constructed in \cite{BS25} and thus deduce the
existence of an explicit family of stable proper biharmonic maps to Euclidean
spheres.

TL;DR: The paper explores internally heated and cooled convection, showing it can achieve diffusion-free heat transport scalings more efficiently than traditional methods, with implications for computational modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical assumptions of diffusion-free heat transport in astrophysical convection and the computational challenges of achieving such behavior in simulations.

Method: Direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal convection using internal heating and cooling functions to avoid sharp thermal boundary layers.

Result: High Rossby numbers recover mixing length theory scalings for heat transport, while velocity amplitudes show diffusion-limited scalings. Internally heated cases exhibit more thermal dissipation in the bulk, enhancing convective efficiency.

Conclusion: Internally heated convection in 2.5D offers a computationally efficient way to study diffusion-free heat transport, bridging theory and simulation.

Abstract: Models of astrophysical convection, such as mixing length theory, typically
assume that the heat transport is independent of microphysical diffusivities.
Such 'diffusion-free' behaviour is, however, not observed in numerical
simulations employing standard fixed-flux or fixed-temperature boundary
conditions, except possibly in extreme parameter regimes that are
computationally expensive to achieve. Recent numerical and experimental work
has suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit
diffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we
present direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal
convection driven by an internal heating and cooling function. The use of
distributed heating and cooling functions alleviates sharp thermal boundary
layers that would otherwise be present, allowing the flows to be simulated with
modest computational resources. We show that for high Rossby numbers this
set-up recovers mixing length theory scalings for the heat transport. The
velocity amplitudes, in contrast, are observed to display diffusion-limited
scalings. By comparing against boundary driven rotating convection, we show
that internally heated cases have a larger fraction of their thermal
dissipation occuring in the bulk of the fluid. We suggest this is connected to
the increased convective efficiency observed in these cases. Our results
indicate that 2.5D internally heated convection can be used as a
computationally inexpensive test-bed to investigate some aspects of
diffusion-free heat transport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of MLFFs for solids by leveraging higher-level CC theory and addressing limitations in training data.

Method: Delta-learning approach to combine CC and DFT data, followed by phonon dispersion and VDOS calculations for validation.

Result: MLFFs trained on CC theory yield better agreement with experiments for optical modes and enable anharmonic VDOS estimation.

Conclusion: CC-trained MLFFs outperform DFT-based ones, offering a promising path for accurate solid-state simulations.

Abstract: We investigate Machine-Learned Force Fields (MLFFs) trained on approximate
Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC) level potential energy
surfaces for the carbon diamond and lithium hydride solids. We assess the
accuracy and precision of the MLFFs by calculating phonon dispersions and
vibrational densities of states (VDOS) that are compared to experiment and
reference ab initio results. To overcome limitations from long-range effects
and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning
approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored.
Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational
frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore,
the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium
hydride at the level of CC theory.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes an actor-critic algorithm for solving high-dimensional HJB equations, ensuring boundary conditions and computational efficiency. It proves convergence to an ODE and validates performance with numerical tests up to 200 dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving high-dimensional HJB equations from stochastic control theory using neural networks, ensuring theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Method: Uses a structured critic to satisfy boundary conditions perfectly and a biased gradient for efficiency. The actor minimizes the Hamiltonian integral, estimated by the critic. Proves convergence to an ODE and validates with numerical tests.

Result: Training dynamics converge to an infinite-dimensional ODE, and fixed points solve the control problem. Numerical tests confirm accuracy in up to 200 dimensions.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees and practical performance for solving high-dimensional HJB equations, though limitations exist for non-convex Hamiltonians.

Abstract: We mathematically analyze and numerically study an actor-critic machine
learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
partial differential equations from stochastic control theory. The architecture
of the critic (the estimator for the value function) is structured so that the
boundary condition is always perfectly satisfied (rather than being included in
the training loss) and utilizes a biased gradient which reduces computational
cost. The actor (the estimator for the optimal control) is trained by
minimizing the integral of the Hamiltonian over the domain, where the
Hamiltonian is estimated using the critic. We show that the training dynamics
of the actor and critic neural networks converge in a Sobolev-type space to a
certain infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number
of hidden units in the actor and critic $\rightarrow \infty$. Further, under a
convexity-like assumption on the Hamiltonian, we prove that any fixed point of
this limit ODE is a solution of the original stochastic control problem. This
provides an important guarantee for the algorithm's performance in light of the
fact that finite-width neural networks may only converge to a local minimizers
(and not optimal solutions) due to the non-convexity of their loss functions.
In our numerical studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm can solve
stochastic control problems accurately in up to 200 dimensions. In particular,
we construct a series of increasingly complex stochastic control problems with
known analytic solutions and study the algorithm's numerical performance on
them. These problems range from a linear-quadratic regulator equation to highly
challenging equations with non-convex Hamiltonians, allowing us to identify and
analyze the strengths and limitations of this neural actor-critic method for
solving HJB equations.

TL;DR: Numerical evidence shows finite-time singularities in 3D axisymmetric IMHD equations, dependent on initial velocity-magnetic field strength ratio C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how finite-time singularities develop in IMHD equations under varying initial conditions.

Method: Analyzed 3D axisymmetric IMHD equations in a wall-bounded cylindrical domain with smooth initial data, varying C.

Result: Singularity type depends on C: shear intensification (C<1), no evolution (C=1), or cusp-type (C>1). Pressure evolution provides insights.

Conclusion: Initial conditions (C) critically determine singularity development in IMHD systems.

Abstract: We provide compelling numerical evidence for the development of (potential)
finite-time singularities in the three-dimensional (3D) axisymmetric, ideal,
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (IMHD) equations, in a wall-bounded
cylindrical domain, starting from smooth initial data, for the velocity and
magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the nature of the singularity depends
crucially on the relative strength C of the velocity and magnetic fields at the
time of initialisation: (i) if C < 1, then the swirl components, at the wall,
evolve towards square profiles that lead to the intensification of shear at the
meridional plane (r = 1, z = L/2) and the development of a finite-time
singularity; (ii) if C = 1, there is no temporal evolution; (iii) if C > 1,
then the swirl components, at the wall, evolve towards a cusp-type singularity.
By examining the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure, we obtain insights
into the development of these singularities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability of fluid-structure interactions in viscous fluids at zero Reynolds number, particularly for numerical simulations.

Method: Uses the method of regularized Stokeslets (MRS) in a doubly periodic 3D domain, linearizing the system to solve for eigenvalues determining critical time steps.

Result: Derives a power law relationship between regularization parameters and surface discretization, validated numerically across various conditions.

Conclusion: The stability analysis and new Stokeslets provide practical insights for numerical simulations, with empirical validation extending to finite surfaces in bulk fluids.

Abstract: A linear stability analysis of an elastic surface immersed in a viscous fluid
is presented. The coupled system is modeled using the method of regularized
Stokeslets (MRS), a Lagrangian method for simulating fluid-structure
interaction at zero Reynolds number. The linearized system is solved in a
doubly periodic domain in a 3D fluid. The eigenvalues determine the theoretical
critical time step for numerical stability for a forward Euler time
integration, which are then verified numerically across several regularization
functions, elastic models, and parameter choices. New doubly periodic
regularized Stokeslets are presented, allowing for comparison of the stability
properties of different regularization functions. The stability results for a
common regularization function are approximated by a power law relating the
regularization parameter and the surface discretization for two different
elastic models. This relationship is empirically shown to hold in the different
setting of a finite surface in a bulk fluid.

Conclusion: Spectral Barron spaces unify approximation theory, functional analysis, and machine learning, offering analytical foundations and practical applications.

Abstract: Spectral Barron spaces, constituting a specialized class of function spaces
that serve as an interdisciplinary bridge between mathematical analysis,
partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning, are distinguished
by the decay profiles of their Fourier transform. In this work, we shift from
conventional numerical approximation frameworks to explore advanced functional

present a rigorous characterization of the dual space structure of spectral
Barron spaces, alongside continuous embedding in H\"older spaces established
through real interpolation theory. Furthermore, we investigate applications to
boundary value problems governed by the Schr\"odinger equation, including
spectral analysis of associated linear operators. These contributions elucidate

Motivation: Addressing limitations in traditional cardiovascular treatments by developing targeted, efficient drug delivery systems using sustainable medical technologies.

Method: Investigates Casson-Maxwell nanofluid flow, analyzing velocity profiles, skin friction, and heat transfer rates with varying nanoparticle volume fractions and parameters.

Result: Casson-Maxwell fluid improves drug residence time; heat transfer varies with nanoparticle types; skin friction changes significantly with Maxwell and Casson parameters.

Conclusion: The study advances interdisciplinary collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare, supporting sustainable development goals through innovative drug delivery solutions.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in
traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems
that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing
directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable
medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a
Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities,
such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The
Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids,
which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The
heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and
aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of
silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a
unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a
unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by
fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and
healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with
an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation
training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source
and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume
fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to
the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Result: MAD demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in 2D parametric problems, handling complex parameter spaces effectively.

Conclusion: MAD offers a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing, combining rigor and scalability.

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving

model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This

Motivation: Addressing shot-to-shot fluctuations in electron beams from laser wakefield accelerators to improve beam stability and quality for applications.

Method: Employing fluctuating beams to drive a plasma photocathode-based wakefield refinement stage, leveraging simulation-based analysis.

Result: Secondary beams exhibit greater stability, higher quality, and improved reliability due to compensation mechanisms in plasma wakefield acceleration and photocathode injection.

Conclusion: Plasma photocathodes are ideal injectors for hybrid laser-plasma wakefield accelerators, enhancing prospects for demanding applications like free-electron lasers.

Abstract: Shot-to-shot fluctuations in electron beams from laser wakefield accelerators
present a significant challenge for applications. Here, we show that instead of
using such fluctuating beams directly, employing them to drive a plasma
photocathode-based wakefield refinement stage can produce secondary electron
beams with greater stability, higher quality, and improved reliability. Our
simulation-based analysis reveals that drive beam jitters are compensated by
both the insensitivity of beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration, and the
decoupled physics of plasma photocathode injection. While beam-driven,
dephasing-free plasma wakefield acceleration mitigates energy and energy spread
fluctuations, intrinsically synchronized plasma photocathode injection
compensates charge and current jitters of incoming electron beams, and provides
a simultaneous quality boost. Our findings suggest plasma photocathodes are
ideal injectors for hybrid laser-plasma wakefield accelerators, and nurture
prospects for demanding applications such as free-electron lasers.
