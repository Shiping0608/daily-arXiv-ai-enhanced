The methodology\nrelies on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method to reduce the\ndimensionality of the parametric flow fields and on an overlapping domain\ndecomposition (DD) paradigm to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of\nfreedom in space. The DD-PGD approach provides a non-intrusive framework in\nwhich end-users only need access to the matrices arising from the (finite\nelement) discretization of the full-order problems in the subdomains. The\ntraces of the finite element functions used for the discretization within the\nsubdomains are employed to impose arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at\nthe interface, without introducing auxiliary basis functions. The methodology\nis seamless to the choice of the discretization schemes in space, being\ncompatible with both LBB-compliant finite element pairs and stabilized\nformulations, and the DD-PGD paradigm is transparent to the employed\noverlapping DD approach. The local surrogate models are glued together in the\nonline phase by solving a parametric interface system to impose continuity of\nthe subdomain solutions at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange\nmultipliers to enforce the continuity in the entire overlap and without solving\nany additional physical problem in the reduced space. Numerical results are\npresented for parametric single-physics (Stokes-Stokes) and multi-physics\n(Stokes-Darcy) systems, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and computational\nefficiency of DD-PGD, and its capability to outperform DD methods based on\nhigh-fidelity finite element solvers in terms of computing times.", "AI": {"tldr": "A method (DD-PGD) combines proper generalized decomposition and domain decomposition to create efficient local surrogate models for parametric Stokes and Stokes-Darcy systems, outperforming traditional high-fidelity solvers.", "motivation": "To reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency in solving parametric Stokes and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems.", "method": "Uses PGD for dimensionality reduction and overlapping domain decomposition to minimize globally coupled degrees of freedom.
