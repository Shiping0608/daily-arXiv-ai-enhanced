Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive\nor iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the\ndimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is\nimportant that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively.\nSecondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract\nvectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to\nemploy so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder\nQR.\n  For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used\nin MOR applications.

By reformulating the problem in an abstract\nframework, we use semigroup theory and energy methods to establish\nwell-posedness and derive conditions that guarantee exponential energy decay.\nIn the second case, we examine a scenario where a frictional damping term\nappears in the first equation, while the second equation contains an indefinite\ndamping term, namely with a sign-changing coefficient. Although this setup can\nbe viewed as a special case of the first, we analyze it separately and show\nthat exponential stability still holds under a weaker condition."}

The\nproposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the\nSPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal\nreference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a\nreference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered\nvia traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH\nspace via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The\nproposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \\emph{meshless}\nGalerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection\nmodel-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three\nnumerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and\n3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and\npredictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed\nframework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations\nin a low-dimensional subspace.

This\nuniversality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus\nshowing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity,\nprovided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The\nproof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and\ncosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between\nBeltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds."}

By applying the half-Laplacian\noperator $(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the\nrelationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\\Delta)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, we\nreformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then\nconvert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \\textit{spectrum\ndoubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the\ninitial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals\nduring the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For\nthe resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose\nstability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt\nBoundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and\nsecond-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error\nestimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large\nlinear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a\nparallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the\nsecond-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection\nor for complex fractional Schr\\\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach."}
