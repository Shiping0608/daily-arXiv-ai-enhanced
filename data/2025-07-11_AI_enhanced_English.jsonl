The proposed\nframework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the\nchallenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic,\nand mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The\nproposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the\nSPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal\nreference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a\nreference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered\nvia traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH\nspace via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The\nproposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \\emph{meshless}\nGalerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection\nmodel-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three\nnumerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and\n3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and\npredictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed\nframework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations\nin a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is\nsensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible\nassumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through\nnonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented\nmeshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic\ncost savings of SPH simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "A meshless model-order reduction framework for SPH simulations using modal reference spaces to achieve low-dimensional representations while preserving meshless qualities.", "motivation": "To address challenges in discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic SPH simulations.", "method": "Introduces modal reference spaces, projects SPH data onto them for low-dimensional representation, and maps back via interpolation.
