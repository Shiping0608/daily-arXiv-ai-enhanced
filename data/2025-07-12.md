### [1] [Scalable ADER-DG Transport Method with Polynomial Order Independent CFL Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07304)
*Kieran Ricardo,Kenneth Duru*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel ADER-DG scheme with local implicitness is introduced to overcome restrictive time step constraints in high-order DG methods, achieving stability independent of polynomial degree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DG methods face efficiency limitations due to time step constraints at high polynomial orders, prompting the need for a more stable approach.

Method: The proposed method combines local implicit solutions with global explicit ADER-DG, enabling stable time steps governed by element-width CFL conditions.

Result: The method achieves stability for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions, validated by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The scheme effectively addresses DG stability issues, offering a practical solution for transport-dominated problems.

Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are known to suffer from increasingly
restrictive time step constraints as the polynomial order increases, limiting
their efficiency at high orders. In this paper, we introduce a novel locally
implicit, but globally explicit ADER-DG scheme designed for transport-dominated
problems. The method achieves a maximum stable time step governed by an
element-width based CFL condition that is independent of the polynomial degree.
By solving a set of element-local implicit problems at each time step, our
approach more effectively captures the domain of dependence. As a result, our
method remains stable for CFL numbers up to $1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ spatial
dimensions. We provide a rigorous stability proof in one dimension, and extend
the analysis to two and three dimensions using a semi-analytical von Neumann
stability analysis. The accuracy and convergence of the method are demonstrated
through numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear test cases.

### [2] [Spectral connvergece of random feature method in one dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07371)
*Pingbing Ming,Hao Yu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper shows spectral convergence of RFM for 1D elliptic equations in Gevrey/Sobolev spaces, highlights PUM's role in improving convergence, and analyzes RFMtx's singular value decay and condition number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the approximation error and convergence properties of RFM for solving PDEs, and explore PUM's impact on RFM's performance.

Method: Applies RFM to 1D second-order elliptic equations, uses PUM to enhance convergence, and analyzes RFMtx's singular values and condition number.

Result: RFM exhibits spectral convergence in Gevrey/Sobolev spaces; PUM improves convergence rate; RFMtx's singular values decay exponentially, and PUM mitigates excessive decay.

Conclusion: RFM is efficient for PDEs, PUM enhances its convergence, and understanding RFMtx's properties is crucial for stability.

Abstract: Among the various machine learning methods solving partial differential
equations, the Random Feature Method (RFM) stands out due to its accuracy and
efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrate that the approximation error of RFM
exhibits spectral convergence when it is applied to the second-order elliptic
equations in one dimension, provided that the solution belongs to Gevrey
classes or Sobolev spaces. We highlight the significant impact of incorporating
the Partition of Unity Method (PUM) to enhance the convergence of RFM by
establishing the convergence rate in terms of the maximum patch size.
Furthermore, we reveal that the singular values of the random feature matrix
(RFMtx) decay exponentially, while its condition number increases exponentially
as the number of the features grows. We also theoretically illustrate that PUM
may mitigate the excessive decay of the singular values of RFMtx.

### [3] [A structure-preserving finite element framework for the Vlasov-Maxwell system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07607)
*Katharina Kormann,Murtazo Nazarov,Junjie Wen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A stabilized, structure-preserving finite element framework for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, using tensor product spaces and novel artificial viscosity for stability, validated on reduced systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and high-order accurate method for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations while preserving structure and ensuring stability.

Method: Uses tensor product of polynomial spaces for Vlasov equation and curl-/divergence-conforming elements for Maxwell's equations, with residual-based artificial viscosity for stabilization.

Result: Achieves optimal convergence orders in 1D2V and 2D2V reduced systems, validated through challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective, robust, and high-order accurate for solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations.

Abstract: We present a stabilized, structure-preserving finite element framework for
solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations. The method uses a tensor product of
continuous polynomial spaces for the spatial and velocity domains,
respectively, to discretize the Vlasov equation, combined with curl- and
divergence-conforming N\'ed\'elec and Raviart-Thomas elements for Maxwell's
equations on Cartesian grids. A novel, robust, consistent, and high-order
accurate residual-based artificial viscosity method is introduced for
stabilizing the Vlasov equations. The proposed method is tested on the 1D2V and
2D2V reduced Vlasov-Maxwell system, achieving optimal convergence orders for
all polynomial spaces considered in this study. Several challenging benchmarks
are solved to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [4] [Non-uniform time-stepping in k-space pseudospectral time domain models of acoustic propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07635)
*Matthew J. King,B. E. Treeby,B. T. Cox*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends the k-space correction to non-uniform time stepping in acoustic propagation models, addressing accuracy and computational efficiency in heterogeneous domains like breast ultrasound tomography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve acoustic simulations by adapting the k-space correction for non-uniform time stepping, enabling better accuracy and cost efficiency in heterogeneous domains.

Method: Expands the existing k-space correction to accommodate non-uniform time stepping, demonstrating its application in pseudo-spectral time domain models.

Result: The proposed method allows for accurate simulations with non-uniform time steps, balancing computational cost and precision in heterogeneous regions.

Conclusion: The extended k-space correction enhances acoustic propagation models, offering flexibility and efficiency for simulations like breast ultrasound tomography.

Abstract: Non-uniform time stepping in acoustic propagation models can be used to
preserve accuracy or reduce computational cost for an acoustic simulation with
a wave front propagating through a domain with both heterogeneous and
homogenous regions, such as for a simulation of breast ultrasound tomography.
The k-space correction already exist within the literature to remove numerical
dispersion caused by the time stepping procedure in pseudo-spectral time domain
models, but requires a uniform time step. Here we expand this correction to be
able to account for a non-uniform time stepping method and illustrate the
potential advantages and considerations. A version of this Article has been
submitted for review to the Journal of Theoretical and Computational Acoustics.

### [5] [A preconditioned boundary value method for advection-diffusion equations with half Laplacian via spectrum doubling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07717)
*Pu Yuan,Paul Zegeling,Xian-Ming Gu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper reformulates a fractional advection-diffusion equation using a half-Laplacian operator, avoiding singular integrals and reducing errors. It employs Boundary Value Methods for stability and proposes efficient solvers, demonstrating second-order convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address numerical challenges in solving fractional advection-diffusion equations, such as singular integrals and stability issues with standard methods.

Method: Reformulates the problem using a half-Laplacian operator, converts it into a first-order system, and applies Boundary Value Methods (BVMs) for stable and accurate solutions.

Result: Achieves second-order convergence in time and space, validated through numerical experiments, including complex fractional Schr√∂dinger-type problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective and versatile, offering stable and accurate solutions for fractional advection-diffusion problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an advection-diffusion equation that involves a
half-Laplacian operator derived from the Riesz fractional Laplacian, combined
with a differential operator \(\mathcal{L}\). By applying the half-Laplacian
operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the
relationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we
reformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then
convert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \textit{spectrum
doubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the
initial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals
during the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For
the resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose
stability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt
Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and
second-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error
estimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large
linear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a
parallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the
second-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection
or for complex fractional Schr\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the
effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.

### [6] [Towards an Efficient Shifted Cholesky QR for Applications in Model Order Reduction using pyMOR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07788)
*Maximilian Bindhak,Art J. R. Pelling,Jens Saak*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper discusses efficient orthogonalization methods for model order reduction (MOR), focusing on iterative and communication-avoiding algorithms like Cholesky QR, with proposed improvements for ill-conditioned matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOR requires iterative and adaptable orthogonalization methods that avoid explicit vector access and communication bottlenecks, especially for high-dimensional problems.

Method: The work proposes an updating scheme for Cholesky QR algorithms and an improved shifting strategy for ill-conditioned matrices, validated through numerical experiments.

Result: The proposed extensions enhance the performance of Cholesky QR for MOR, particularly in memory-bandwidth-limited and parallel settings.

Conclusion: The improved Cholesky QR methods are effective for MOR, offering better adaptability and performance for ill-conditioned matrices.

Abstract: Many model order reduction (MOR) methods rely on the computation of an
orthonormal basis of a subspace onto which the large full order model is
projected. Numerically, this entails the orthogonalization of a set of vectors.
The nature of the MOR process imposes several requirements for the
orthogonalization process. Firstly, MOR is oftentimes performed in an adaptive
or iterative manner, where the quality of the reduced order model, i.e., the
dimension of the reduced subspace, is decided on the fly. Therefore, it is
important that the orthogonalization routine can be executed iteratively.
Secondly, one possibly has to deal with high-dimensional arrays of abstract
vectors that do not allow explicit access to entries, making it difficult to
employ so-called `orthogonal triangularization algorithms' such as Householder
QR.
  For these reasons, (modified) Gram-Schmidt-type algorithms are commonly used
in MOR applications. These methods belong to the category of `triangular
orthogonalization' algorithms that do not rely on elementwise access to the
vectors and can be easily updated. Recently, algorithms like shifted Cholesky
QR have gained attention. These also belong to the aforementioned category and
have proven their aptitude for MOR algorithms in previous studies. A key
benefit of these methods is that they are communication-avoiding, leading to
vastly superior performance on memory-bandwidth-limited problems and parallel
or distributed architectures. This work formulates an efficient updating scheme
for Cholesky QR algorithms and proposes an improved shifting strategy for
highly ill-conditioned matrices.
  The proposed algorithmic extensions are validated with numerical experiments
on a laptop and computation server.

### [7] [A fast algorithm for the wave equation using time-windowed Fourier projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07823)
*Nour G. Al Hassanieh,Alex H. Barnett,Leslie Greengard*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A high-order method for evaluating hyperbolic potentials efficiently, reducing computational work from O(M¬≤N_t¬≤) to O((M + N_F log N_F)N_t) in 1D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of naive implementations for hyperbolic potentials, which require O(M¬≤N_t¬≤) work.

Method: Uses a smoothly windowed decomposition into local and history parts, approximating the latter with a Fourier series and leveraging the non-uniform fast Fourier transform.

Result: Achieves 10-digit accuracy in tests, scaling efficiently even for large M (up to a million).

Conclusion: The method is highly efficient and accurate for time-domain scattering problems with hyperbolic potentials.

Abstract: We introduce a new arbitrarily high-order method for the rapid evaluation of
hyperbolic potentials (space-time integrals involving the Green's function for
the scalar wave equation). With $M$ points in the spatial discretization and
$N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive implementation would require
$\mathcal O(M^2N_t^2)$ work in dimensions where the weak Huygens' principle
applies. We avoid this all-to-all interaction using a smoothly windowed
decomposition into a local part, treated directly, plus a history part,
approximated by a $N_F$-term Fourier series. In one dimension, our method
requires $\mathcal O\left((M + N_F \log N_F)N_t\right)$ work, with $N_F
=\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, by exploiting the non-uniform fast Fourier transform.
We demonstrate the method's performance for time-domain scattering problems
involving a large number $M$ of springs (point scatterers) attached to a
vibrating string at arbitrary locations, with either periodic or free-space
boundary conditions. We typically achieve 10-digit accuracy, and include tests
for $M$ up to a million.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise behavior of singular solutions to the equation -Œîu = exp(u) in specific parameter ranges and domains.

Method: A priori estimates near singular points and dynamical systems techniques for radial solutions.

Result: Precise behavior of singular solutions is derived, and existence of such solutions is proven.

Abstract: We study the local properties of positive solutions of the equation -Delta u=
exp(u) in a punctured domain Omega of RN in the range of parameters q > 1 and M

of radial solutions we use various techniques inherited from the dynamical
systems theory to obtain the precise behaviour of singular solutions. We prove
also the existence of singular solutions with these precise behaviours.

### [9] [$C^{\infty}$-structures approach to travelling wave solutions to the gKdV equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07112)
*Antonio J. Pan-Collantes*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A geometric method for finding traveling wave solutions to the generalized KdV equation using a C‚àû-structure-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the analysis of the gKdV equation by reducing it to an ODE and leveraging geometric methods for solution derivation.

Method: Uses a traveling wave ansatz to reduce the gKdV equation to an ODE, then applies a C‚àû-structure-based geometric framework involving involutive distributions and Pfaffian equations.

Result: Derived implicit general solutions and explicit solutions for specific cases like modified KdV and Schamel-KdV equations.

Conclusion: The geometric method effectively simplifies and solves the gKdV equation for various nonlinearities.

Abstract: We present a geometric method for finding travelling wave solutions to the
generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation $$ u_t + u_{xxx} + a(u)u_x = 0,
$$ where $a(u)$ is a smooth function characterizing the nonlinearity. Using the
travelling wave ansatz, the gKdV equation reduces to an ordinary differential
equation (ODE), which we analyze via the $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure-based
method, a geometric framework involving sequences of involutive distributions
and Pfaffian equations. Starting with the symmetry $\partial_z$, we construct a
$\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure for the ODE and apply the stepwise integration
algorithm to obtain an implicit general solution. We illustrate the method by
deriving explicit solutions for specific forms of $a(u)$, including the
modified KdV and Schamel--KdV equations, as well as power-law nonlinearities.

### [10] [Global invertibility of Sobolev mappings with prescribed homeomorphic boundary values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07206)
*Sabrina Traver*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies Sobolev mappings with positive Jacobian determinants that extend homeomorphisms between Lipschitz domains, proving they are continuous, monotone surjections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of Sobolev mappings in the context of weak interpenetration of matter, generalizing prior work on global invertibility.

Method: Analyze Sobolev mappings in $W^{1,n}$ with positive Jacobian determinants, extending homeomorphisms between Lipschitz domains.

Result: Mappings are continuous, monotone surjections, avoiding folding but allowing weak interpenetration.

Conclusion: The results generalize Ball's work, showing global invertibility despite weak interpenetration.

Abstract: Let $X, Y \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be Lipschitz domains, and suppose there is a
homeomorphism $\varphi \colon \overline{X} \to \overline{Y}$. We consider the
class of Sobolev mappings $f \in W^{1,n} (X, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with a strictly
positive Jacobian determinant almost everywhere, whose Sobolev trace coincides
with $\varphi$ on $\partial X$. We prove that every mapping in this class
extends continuously to $\overline{X}$ and is a monotone (continuous)
surjection from $\overline{X}$ onto $\overline{Y}$ in the sense of C.B. Morrey.
As monotone mappings, they may squeeze but not fold the reference configuration
$X$. This behavior reflects weak interpenetration of matter, as opposed to
folding, which corresponds to strong interpenetration. Despite allowing weak
interpenetration of matter, these maps are globally invertible, generalizing
the pioneering work of J.M. Ball.

### [11] [Global Bifurcation In Four-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates In Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07235)
*Carlos Garc√≠a-Azpeitia,Anna Go≈Ç»©biewska,Wieslaw Krawcewicz,Jingzhou Liu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a 3D unitary ball, analyzing bifurcations in the system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations. It proves multiple global bifurcations for high-dimensional kernels and uses G-equivariant gradient degree to handle complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates under atom-to-atom interactions, particularly focusing on bifurcations from trivial solutions.

Method: Uses the system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations and applies G-equivariant gradient degree to analyze bifurcations in high-dimensional kernels.

Result: Establishes multiple global bifurcations, with at least two branches for k=0 and six for k=1.

Conclusion: The G-equivariant gradient degree effectively addresses high-dimensional kernel challenges, proving the existence of multiple bifurcating branches.

Abstract: We analyze a system of coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the domain of a
unitary ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The coupling is due to atom-to-atom
interactions that occur between different gas components. The multi-component
Bose-Einstein condensate is described by a system of Gross-Pitaevskii
equations, which has an explicit trivial branch of constant solutions
bifurcating from the zero-solution. Our main theorem establishes that this
trivial branch undergoes multiple global bifurcations at any critical values
with kernels of dimensions at least $3(2k+1)$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}^+$.
Handling these high dimension kernels poses a challenge from the perspective of
bifurcation theory. Our methodology, which relies on the $G$-equivariant
gradient degree, effectively manages these complexities and establishes the
existence of at least two global branch in the particular case of $k = 0$ and
at least six branches in the case of $k = 1$.

### [12] [Indirect stabilization of nonlinear coupled wave equations in the presence of time delay or indefinite damping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07311)
*Alhabib Moumni,Cristina Pignotti,Jawad Salhi,Mouhcine Tilioua*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the exponential stability of two coupled nonlinear wave equations, examining two cases: one with damping and time delay, and another with frictional and indefinite damping. Stability conditions are derived using semigroup theory and energy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and establish conditions for exponential stability in coupled nonlinear wave equations with varying damping and delay effects.

Method: Uses semigroup theory and energy methods to reformulate the problem and derive stability conditions.

Result: Exponential stability is proven for both cases, with weaker conditions required for the second scenario.

Conclusion: The study confirms exponential stability in coupled wave equations under specific damping and delay conditions, providing insights for similar systems.

Abstract: This paper explores the exponential stability of two nonlinear wave equations
coupled through their velocities. The analysis is divided into two main cases.
First, we consider a system where one equation is damped, while the other
experiences a discrete time delay. By reformulating the problem in an abstract
framework, we use semigroup theory and energy methods to establish
well-posedness and derive conditions that guarantee exponential energy decay.
In the second case, we examine a scenario where a frictional damping term
appears in the first equation, while the second equation contains an indefinite
damping term, namely with a sign-changing coefficient. Although this setup can
be viewed as a special case of the first, we analyze it separately and show
that exponential stability still holds under a weaker condition.

*Gayoung An,Donghyun Lee*

TL;DR: The paper establishes optimal $C^{\frac{1}{2}}_{x,v}$ regularity for the Boltzmann equation past a convex obstacle using a new dynamical singular regime integration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of severe singularity in billiard trajectories near grazing sets in non-convex domains with specular reflection boundary conditions, a problem unresolved until recently.

Method: A novel dynamical singular regime integration methodology is introduced.

Result: Optimal $C^{\frac{1}{2}}_{x,v}$ regularity is proven for the Boltzmann equation past a convex obstacle.

Conclusion: The new method successfully overcomes the singularity issue, achieving the optimal regularity result.

Abstract: Regularity of the Boltzmann equation, particularly in the presence of
physical boundary conditions, heavily relies on the geometry of the boundaries.
In the case of non-convex domains with specular reflection boundary conditions,
the problem remained outstanding until recently due to the severe singularity
of billiard trajectories near the grazing set, where the trajectory map is not
differentiable. This challenge was addressed in [32], where
$C^{\frac{1}{2}-}_{x,v}$ H\"{o}lder regularity was proven. In this paper, we
introduce a novel dynamical singular regime integration methodology to
establish the optimal $C^{\frac{1}{2}}_{x,v}$ regularity for the Boltzmann
equation past a convex obstacle.

### [15] [On the weak flocking of the kinetic Cucker-Smale model in a fully non-compact support setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07493)
*Seung-Yeal Ha,Xinyu Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes weak solutions of the kinetic Cucker-Smale (KCS) model in non-compact spatial-velocity settings, overcoming challenges like zero lower bounds for communication weights and lack of linear growth bounds. It refines estimates for spatial-velocity moments, proves uniqueness, and shows emergent flocking dynamics for distributions with exponential or polynomial decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend understanding of flocking dynamics in the KCS model beyond compact support settings, addressing challenges posed by non-compact support.

Method: Derives refined estimates for second-order spatial-velocity moments and uses trajectory deviation analysis to prove uniqueness. Examines two classes of distribution functions (exponential and polynomial decay) to study emergent dynamics.

Result: Shows asymptotic convergence of velocity deviation to zero and bounded spatial deviation, confirming robust mono-cluster flocking in non-compact settings.

Conclusion: The study generalizes previous compact support results, demonstrating the KCS model's robustness in non-compact phase space for flocking dynamics.

Abstract: We study the emergent behaviors of the weak solutions to the kinetic
Cucker-Smale (in short, KCS) model in a non-compact spatial-velocity support
setting. Unlike the compact support situation, non-compact support of a weak
solution can cause a communication weight to have zero lower bounds, and
position difference does not have a uniformly linear growth bound. These cause
the previous approach based on the nonlinear functional approach for spatial
and velocity diameters to break down. To overcome these difficulties, we derive
refined estimates on the upper bounds for the second-order spatial-velocity
moments and show the uniqueness of the weak solution using the estimate on the
deviation of particle trajectories. For the estimate of emergent dynamics, we
consider two classes of distribution functions with decaying properties (an
exponential decay or polynomial decay) in phase space, and then verify that the
second moment for the velocity deviation from an average velocity tends to zero
asymptotically, while the second moment for spatial deviation from the center
of mass remains bounded uniformly in time. This illustrates the robustness of
the mono-cluster flocking dynamics of the KCS model even for fully non-compact
support settings in phase space and generalizes earlier results on flocking
dynamics in a compact support setting.

### [16] [Emergent dynamics of spatially extended relativistic kinetic Cucker-Smale model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07502)
*Seung-Yeal Ha,Xinyu Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the relativistic kinetic Cucker-Smale (RKCS) model without compactness assumptions, introducing a decay ansatz and an effective domain to show weak flocking dynamics asymptotically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative flocking estimates in the RKCS model when the kernel function's lower bound is zero, overcoming limitations of the energy method.

Method: Introduces a decay ansatz for the one-particle distribution function and defines an effective domain to analyze mass decay.

Result: Weak flocking emerges asymptotically: velocity fluctuations vanish, while spatial fluctuations remain bounded.

Conclusion: The RKCS model's emergent dynamics are robust across non-compact distributions like Gaussian, sub-Gaussian, and integrable distributions.

Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of the relativistic kinetic Cucker-Smale
(RKCS) model without assuming compactness in spatial and velocity support. In
this setting, the lower bound of the kernel function in the nonlocal velocity
alignment force can be zero so that the previous approach based on the energy
method does not provide a quantitative flocking estimate. To overcome this
difficulty, we introduce a suitable decay ansatz for the one-particle
distribution function and an {\it effective domain} by identifying a
time-varying region in which the total mass outside of it decays to zero
asymptotically. Using these two ingredients, we show that weak flocking
dynamics emerges asymptotically in the sense that the second moment for the
velocity fluctuation around the velocity average tends to zero asymptotically,
whereas the second moment for spatial fluctuations around the center of mass
remains bounded uniformly in time. Our results demonstrate the robustness of
the emergent dynamics in the RKCS model across various non-compact physically
important distributions, including Gaussian, sub-Gaussian, and $D$-th moment
integrable distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the mathematical foundations of primitive equations in ocean/atmosphere dynamics on specific domains.

Method: Established global existence/uniqueness for small data in anisotropic Besov space; justified singular limit from anisotropic Navier-Stokes.

Result: Proved well-posedness for small initial data and validated the singular limit.

Conclusion: The primitive equations are well-posed under the studied conditions, and the singular limit is mathematically justified.

Abstract: In this work, we study the well-posedness of the primitive equations for the
ocean and the atmosphere on two specific domains: a bounded domain
$\Omega_1\mathrel{\mathop:}=(-1,1)^3$ with periodic boundary conditions, and
the strip $\Omega_2\mathrel{\mathop:}=\mathbb{R}^2\times(-1,1)$ with periodic
boundary conditions in the vertical direction. In a first time, we establish a
global existence and uniqueness theorem for small initial data in a suitable
anisotropic Besov space. Then, we also justify, in a similar functional
framework, the singular limit from the anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations to

*Lin Guo,Dan Li*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies a chemotaxis system with weak degradation and nonlinear motility, proving global bounded solutions, exponential convergence to equilibrium, and validating results numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of chemotaxis systems with weak degradation and nonlinear motility functions, which are relevant in biological modeling.

Method: Energy estimate methods for global bounded solutions, Lyapunov function construction for exponential convergence, and numerical simulations for validation.

Result: Existence of globally bounded solutions, exponential convergence to equilibrium under certain conditions, and numerical validation.

Conclusion: The system exhibits stable behavior under specified conditions, with numerical results supporting theoretical findings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the following chemotaxis system featuring weak
degradation and nonlinear motility functions
  \begin{equation}\label{Model1}
  \begin{cases}
  u_{t} = (\gamma(v)u)_{xx} + r - \mu u, & x \in [0,L],\ t > 0,
  v_{t} = v_{xx} - v + u, & x \in [0,L],\ t > 0,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} defined on the bounded interval $[0,L]$ with homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions. The motility function $\gamma(v)$ satisfies the
regularity conditions $\gamma \in C^{2}[0,\infty)$ with $\gamma(v) > 0$ for all
$v \geq 0$, and has bounded logarithmic derivative in the sense that
$\sup_{v\geq 0} \frac{|\gamma'(v)|^{2}}{\gamma(v)} < \infty$. Our main results
establish three fundamental properties of the system. Firstly, using energy
estimate methods, we prove the existence of globally bounded solutions for all
positive parameters $r, \mu > 0$ and non-negative, non-trivial initial data
$u_{0} \in W^{1,\infty}([0,L])$. Secondly, through the construction of an
appropriate Lyapunov function, we demonstrate that all solutions $(u,v)$
converge exponentially to the unique constant equilibrium $(r/\mu, r/\mu)$ in
the parameter regime $\mu > \frac{H_{0}}{16}$, where $H_{0} := \sup_{v \geq 0}
\frac{|\gamma'(v)|^{2}}{\gamma(v)}$ quantifies the maximal relative variation
of the motility function. Finally, we present numerical results that not only
validate the theoretical findings but also investigate the long-term behavior
of solutions under diverse parameter configurations and initial conditions in
two- and three-dimensional domains, providing valuable benchmarks for future
research.

Result: Classical Liouville theorems are reestablished for the studied equations.

Conclusion: The invariant tensor method and integral estimates provide a robust framework for revisiting and confirming classical results in this context.

Abstract: We study certain typical semilinear elliptic equations in Euclidean space

TL;DR: The paper characterizes minimizers of nonlocal anisotropic Riesz energies on ellipsoids, showing independence of anisotropy in super-Coulombic/Coulombic regimes but not in sub-Coulombic regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how anisotropy affects minimizers of Riesz energies on ellipsoids across different regimes.

Method: Analyzes minimizers using a formula for the potential inside ellipsoids involving hypergeometric functions.

Result: Minimizers are anisotropy-independent in super-Coulombic/Coulombic regimes but not in sub-Coulombic cases.

Conclusion: Anisotropy's impact on minimizers varies by regime, with explicit examples provided for sub-Coulombic cases.

Abstract: In this work we fully characterize, in any space dimension, the minimizer of
a class of nonlocal and anisotropic Riesz energies defined over probability
measures supported on ellipsoids. In the super-Coulombic and Coulombic regime,
we prove that the minimizer is independent of the anisotropy. In contrast, in
the sub-Coulombic regime we show that this property fails: we exhibit an
example of anisotropy for which the isotropic minimizer is not optimal. In
order to prove our main result, we provide a formula for the potential inside
an ellipsoid, valid in any space dimension and involving the hypergeometric
function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict subwavelength resonance in elastic metascreens, especially under extreme shear modulus contrasts.

Method: Asymptotic analysis of layer potential operators is used to study resonance conditions and calculate scattered fields.

Result: Subwavelength resonance occurs when the shear modulus of inclusions tends to infinity, but not when the background's shear modulus does.

Conclusion: The framework successfully predicts resonance conditions and field changes, offering insights for metascreen design.

Abstract: In this paper we provide a mathematical framework based on asymptotic
analysis of layer potential operators for determining the existence of
subwavelength resonance in elastic metascreen and resonance frequency
calculation. We consider the case of high shear modulus contrast between
metascreen inclusions and background medium. When the shear modulus of
inclusions tends to infinity, we prove the occurrence of subwavelength
resonance and demonstrate the dramatic change of scattered field due to
subwavelength resonance by calculating approximated field inside inclusions and
far-away from metascreen. When the shear modulus of background goes to
infinity, we prove the absence of subwavelength resonance.

TL;DR: Existence of strong time-periodic solutions for a multilayered fluid-structure interaction problem is proven using a fixed point argument and detailed linearized system analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the nonlinear coupling in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) involving Navier-Stokes equations and multilayered elastic structures, aiming to establish strong time-periodic solutions.

Method: Fixed point argument with linearized system analysis, employing the Arendt-Bu theorem for maximal periodic L^p-regularity, refined lifting, decoupling strategy, and spectral analysis.

Result: First proof of existence of strong time-periodic solutions for multilayered FSI problems.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the existence of strong time-periodic solutions for complex multilayered FSI systems.

Abstract: This article studies a nonlinearly coupled, time-periodic fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) problem involving the Navier-Stokes equations for an
incompressible, viscous fluid coupled with a multilayered elastic structure
consisting of a thin damped shell and a thick viscoelastic component. The main
objective is to establish the existence of a strong time-periodic solution. To
address the full nonlinear problem, we employ a fixed point argument, which
relies on a detailed analysis of the linearized system together with
appropriate nonlinear estimates. The linearized problem is analyzed by
employing the Arendt-Bu theorem on maximal periodic $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity,
which requires several new analytical ingredients including a careful treatment
of the thick structural layer, a refined lifting procedure, a decoupling
strategy to establish $\mathcal{R}$-sectoriality of the associated FSI operator
and a careful spectral analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first result proving the existence of strong time-periodic solutions for a
multilayered fluid-structure interaction problem.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives an exact relation for EMHD turbulence, showing energy cascade is unaffected by a uniform magnetic field. Simulations reveal a Kolmogorov-like cascade with specific power spectra and confirm a universal cascade rate. The study also identifies a pressure-balanced relaxed state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand electron-scale heating and acceleration in weakly collisional space plasmas using EMHD turbulence modeling.

Method: Derived a divergence-free exact relation for 3D EMHD turbulence, performed direct numerical simulations, and analyzed scale-by-scale energy budgets in Fourier and real space.

Result: Energy cascade is unaffected by a uniform magnetic field. Kolmogorov-like cascade observed with $k^{-7/3}$ and $k^{-5/3}$ spectra. Universal cascade rate confirmed. Pressure-balanced relaxed state identified.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into EMHD turbulence, confirming universal cascade behavior and revealing a relaxed state, advancing understanding of electron-scale plasma dynamics.

Abstract: Electron magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) provides a realistic model for
electron-scale heating and acceleration in weakly collisional space plasmas. A
divergence-free Banerjee-Galtier type (Banerjee and Galtier, JoPA, 2017) exact
relation is derived for three-dimensional homogeneous and not necessarily
isotropic EMHD turbulence. By explicit calculation, it has been shown that the
energy cascade is not affected by the presence of a uniform background magnetic
field Bo. Using direct numerical simulations, a Kolmogorov-like energy cascade
with a constant flux rate is observed across the electron inertial scale $d_e$.
However, as expected, for length scales greater than $d_e$, a magnetic power
spectra of $k^{-7/3}$ is obtained whereas for scales smaller than $d_e$, a
$k^{-5/3}$ spectra is obtained. Similar universal cascade rate is also
calculated from the scale-by-scale budget in Fourier space and is found to be
equal to the one calculated using the exact law in real space. Finally,
quenching the turbulence drive, the relaxation of a fully-developed EMHD
turbulence is studied using the recently proposed principle of vanishing
nonlinear transfers (Banerjee, Halder and Pan, PRE(L), 2023) which convincingly
shows the existence of a pressure-balanced relaxed state.

*Adnane Osmane,Elias Roussos,Peter Kollmann*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: A new drift-kinetic model explains rapid refilling of particle flux depletions (microsignatures) in planetary radiation belts by synchronization, not diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quasi-linear radial diffusion models fail to explain the rapid refilling of microsignatures observed in gas giant magnetospheres.

Method: Develop a drift-kinetic model capturing localized losses and synchronization of particle distribution's azimuthal Fourier modes.

Result: Localized loss regions synchronize particle phases, mimicking refilling, akin to the Kuramoto model.

Conclusion: Synchronization, not diffusion, is key to understanding microsignature evolution near moons in magnetized plasmas.

Abstract: We present a new theoretical framework to describe the rapid and spatially
localized loss of energetic particles in planetary radiation belts, focusing on
interactions between gas giant magnetospheres and their moons. Observations
show that flux depletions--known as microsignatures--often refill on timescales
comparable to a single drift period, which conflicts with traditional
quasi-linear radial diffusion models that assume slow, gradual transport and
predict refilling only over many drift periods. To resolve this inconsistency,
we develop a drift-kinetic model that explicitly captures localized losses
occurring on timescales similar to the azimuthal drift period. We demonstrate
that such localized loss regions can synchronize the azimuthal Fourier modes of
the particle distribution function, producing apparent refilling through
phase-space synchronization rather than diffusion. The resulting governing
equations are mathematically equivalent to a generalized Kuramoto model, widely
used to describe synchronization phenomena. This framework provides a
first-principles, non-diffusive explanation for the evolution of
microsignatures near moons, highlighting synchronization as a fundamental yet
overlooked mechanism in magnetized plasma environments.

### [26] [First-passage time for PDifMPs: an Exact simulation approach for time-varying thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07822)
*Sascha Desmettre,Devika Khurana,Amira Meddah*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: A hybrid exact simulation scheme for computing the first-passage time (FPT) of Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs) to time-dependent thresholds is proposed, addressing challenges in realistic modeling of systems with sudden shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDifMPs model systems with interrupted continuous dynamics, and FPT is crucial for understanding critical boundary crossings. Time-dependent thresholds enhance realism by reflecting evolving conditions.

Method: A hybrid exact simulation scheme is introduced, leveraging exact methods for pure diffusions between jumps. It involves simulating a conditionally constrained auxiliary process and deriving acceptance probabilities when no threshold crossing occurs in an interval.

Result: The method is proven to converge and is demonstrated through numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively computes FPT for PDifMPs to time-dependent thresholds, advancing realistic modeling of systems with dynamic interruptions.

Abstract: Piecewise Diffusion Markov Processes (PDifMPs) are valuable for modelling
systems where continuous dynamics are interrupted by sudden shifts and/or
changes in drift and diffusion. The first-passage time (FPT) in such models
plays a central role in understanding when a process first reaches a critical
boundary. In many systems, time-dependent thresholds provide a flexible
framework for reflecting evolving conditions, making them essential for
realistic modelling. We propose a hybrid exact simulation scheme for computing
the FPT of PDifMPs to time-dependent thresholds. Exact methods traditionally
exist for pure diffusions, using Brownian motion as an auxiliary process and
accepting sampled paths with a probability weight. Between jumps, the PDifMP
evolves as a diffusion, allowing us to apply the exact method within each
inter-jump interval. The main challenge arises when no threshold crossing is
detected in an interval: We then need the value of the process at the jump
time, and for that, we introduce an approach to simulate a conditionally
constrained auxiliary process and derive the corresponding acceptance
probability. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the method and illustrate
it using numerical examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of multi-species interacting particle systems and their mean-field PDEs, particularly in non-convex settings, and to investigate stationary solutions, stability, and phase transitions.

Method: The study involves analyzing the well-posedness of SDE systems, deriving coupled McKean-Vlasov PDEs, and examining long-time behavior. It uses growth assumptions on potentials and symmetry to construct a free-energy functional.

Result: Existence and (non-)uniqueness of stationary solutions are shown, along with linear stability analysis. A phase transition at low noise is proven, and convergence to stationary states is established.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the dynamics of multi-species systems and their mean-field limits, highlighting the role of free-energy functionals and phase transitions in non-convex landscapes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-species stochastic interacting particle systems
and their mean-field McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations (PDEs) in
non-convex landscapes. We discuss the well-posedness of the multi-species SDE
system, propagation of chaos and the derivation of the coupled McKean-Vlasov
PDE system in the mean field limit. Our focus is on the long-time and
asymptotic behaviour of the mean-field PDEs. Under suitable growth assumptions
on the potentials and an appropriate structural assumption, we show the
existence and (non-) uniqueness of stationary solutions and study their linear
stability. Under a symmetry assumption we construct a free-energy functional
that plays the role of a Lyapunov function for the mean-field PDE system.
Furthermore, we prove the existence of a phase transition at low noise
strengths and establish the convergence of solutions to the mean-field PDEs
(and of their free energy) to a stationary state (and the corresponding free
energy).

Motivation: The simplicity and compactness of ECRIPAC, despite past calculation errors, make it promising for future applications.

Method: The study reviews the working principle, corrects literature errors, analyzes stability conditions, designs a compact demonstrator, and validates the framework via Monte-Carlo simulations.

Result: A compact ECRIPAC design accelerates He2+ ions to 9.5 MeV/nucleon, with stricter stability limits than previously thought.

Conclusion: The corrected ECRIPAC framework is validated, offering a reliable reference for future research and applications.

Abstract: The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Plasma ACcelerator (ECRIPAC) is an
original accelerator concept proposed in the nineties for the generation of
highly energetic pulsed ion beams, suitable for a wide array of applications.
The initial studies on the subject were characterized by an important
calculation mistake, leading to an incomplete and erroneous literature on the
topic. Nevertheless, the simple and well mastered techniques involved in the
system (radio frequency and magnetic field), together with the device
compactness, are strong motivations for further studies on ECRIPAC. The working
principle and physical theory behind the ECRIPAC accelerator concept are
thoroughly reviewed in this paper, incorporating significant corrections to the
existing literature on the subject, making this work a suitable reference for
future studies. A detailed theoretical investigation of the stability condition
for the ion acceleration is presented, highlighting more stringent limitations
than previously anticipated. Next, the impact of several physical parameters on
the accelerator design is analyzed. This study led to the design of a compact
demonstrator device able to accelerate He2+ ions up to 9.5 MeV per nucleon
inside a 1.8 m long accelerating cavity. Finally, the results of a Monte-Carlo
simulation, developed to model the electron dynamics inside the system, are
used to validate the theoretical framework of ECRIPAC.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into chaotic dynamics and attractor formation in complex phase space structures.

Abstract: The well known butterfly effect got its nomenclature from its two wings
geometrical structure in phase space. There are chaotic dynamics from simple
one-wing to multiple-wings complex structures in phase space. In this

Nambu mechanics, how does a four-wings complex structure in the phase space
arise for a chaotic dynamical system. We further explore the properties of

TL;DR: A scalable method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator is proposed, avoiding unstable operations like SVD and matrix inversion, and integrating well with deep learning pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like VAMPnet and DPNet for learning Koopman operator singular subspaces involve unstable operations (SVD, matrix inversion), leading to biased gradients and scalability issues.

Method: The proposed method uses low-rank approximation to learn the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator, avoiding unstable linear algebraic operations.

Result: Empirical results show the learned singular subspaces are reliable and effective for tasks like eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: The new method is scalable, stable, and integrates seamlessly with deep learning, offering improved performance for stochastic dynamical systems.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

TL;DR: A novel inversion-free regularized framework is proposed to address numerical instabilities in context-aware low-rank approximation for neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to reliance on classical formulas involving explicit Gram matrix computation and inversion.

Method: The proposed method uses stable decompositions to avoid numerical pitfalls, handling scenarios like large calibration matrices, nearly singular input activations, and insufficient data.

Result: The framework improves approximation quality, avoids numerical singularities, and provides explicit error bounds for insufficient data cases.

Conclusion: The inversion-free approach offers a stable and scalable solution for context-aware low-rank approximation in neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Motivation: To improve understanding and robustness of transformers by refining the Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks and introducing a regularization method.

Method: Developed a refined closed-form expression for the spectral norm of the softmax function to derive a more accurate Lipschitz bound. Introduced JaSMin, a lightweight regularization term.

Result: The new bound is more accurate and reveals the impact of attention score maps on Lipschitz constants. JaSMin improves robustness and reduces Lipschitz constants.

Conclusion: The refined Lipschitz bound and JaSMin regularization enhance transformer robustness and provide deeper insights into attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

TL;DR: A meshless model-order reduction framework for SPH simulations using modal reference spaces to achieve low-dimensional representation while preserving meshless qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic SPH simulations and reduce computational costs.

Method: Introduces modal reference spaces for low-dimensional representation, using POD and APG projection techniques. Tested on three numerical experiments.

Result: Good agreement in velocity fields; pressure fields are sensitive to projection error but can be improved with nonlinear approximations like APG.

Conclusion: The framework enables significant cost savings for SPH simulations while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly
compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed
framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the
challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic,
and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The
proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the
SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal
reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a
reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered
via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH
space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The
proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless}
Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection
model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three
numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and
3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and
predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed
framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations
in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is
sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible
assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through
nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented
meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic
cost savings of SPH simulations.

Result: Provides convergence rates for UOT solutions.

Conclusion: Regularized UOT converges to original solutions for Dirac masses.

Abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) is a natural extension of optimal
transport (OT) allowing comparison between measures of different masses. It
arises naturally in machine learning by offering a robustness against outliers.
The aim of this work is to provide convergence rates of the regularized

### [36] [On the local null controllability of a viscous Burgers' system in finite time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07442)
*Hoai-Minh Nguyen,Minh-Nguyen Tran*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proves that the Burgers control system is not locally null controllable in finite time, extending prior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controllability of the Burgers system, building on Marbach's work and exploring alternative methods.

Method: Inspired by works on KdV system controllability, the authors use a different approach than Marbach.

Result: The Burgers system is not locally null controllable in finite time.

Conclusion: The study confirms the lack of local null controllability in finite time for the Burgers system, using a novel method.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the local null controllability of the Burgers
control system $y_t - y_{xx} + y y_x = u(t)$ on a bounded interval imposed by
the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. It is known from the work of Marbach
that this control system is not locally null controllable in small time. In
this paper, we prove that the system is not locally null controllable in finite
time as well. Our approach is inspired by the works of Coron, Koenig, and
Nguyen, and Nguyen on the controllability of the KdV system and is different
from the one of Marbach.

*Raj Kumar Anand*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper derives non-relativistic boundary conditions for MHD shock waves in van der Waals gases, analyzing shock strength and jump relations under varying magnetic field strengths and non-idealness parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of magnetic fields and non-ideal gas properties on MHD shock waves in van der Waals gases.

Method: Derived Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump relations for pressure, density, and particle velocity, and analyzed weak and strong shocks under different magnetic field conditions.

Result: Expressions for shock strength and simplified jump relations were obtained, showing the impact of magnetic fields and non-idealness on shock properties.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant effects of magnetic field strength and non-idealness on MHD shock behavior in van der Waals gases.

Abstract: In this article, we have presented non-relativistic boundary conditions
across a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock front propagating in van der Waals
gases. The expression for the strength of the non-relativistic MHD shock wave
has been obtained, and the Rankine-Hugoniot (R-H) shock jump relations, or
boundary conditions, for the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity
across an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a shock compression
ratio. The simplified forms of shock jump relations have been written
simultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the magnetic
field strength, the non-idealness parameter, and the ratio of specific heats of
the gas. Further, the case of weak shocks has been explored under two distinct
conditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the
field is strong, respectively. The case of strong shocks has also been
investigated under two distinct ways: (i) as in the purely non-magnetic case,
when the ratio of densities on either side of the shock nearly equals
$(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)$ or (ii) when the applied magnetic field is large. This
is when the ambient magnetic pressure is large as compared with the ambient gas
pressure. Finally, the effects on the shock strength and the pressure across
the MHD shock front are studied due to the magnetic field strength and the
non-idealness parameter of the gases. This study presents an overview of the
influence of the magnetic field strength and the non-idealness parameter on the
shock strength, the pressure, the density, and the particle velocity across the
MHD shock front in van der Waals gases.

### [38] [Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686)
*Davide Carazzato,Giulio Pascale,Marco Pozzetta*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper establishes sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for capillarity functionals and relative perimeter in convex cones, controlling both Fraenkel asymmetry and oscillation asymmetry, with barycentric versions derived.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend quantitative isoperimetric inequalities to perimeter-type functionals in Euclidean half-spaces and convex cones, addressing deviations in boundary normals and providing explicit centers for asymmetry computation.

Method: Uses Fuglede-type estimates for graphs on spherically convex domains and a new application of the selection principle to derive barycentric inequalities.

Result: Sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in strong form, controlling both Fraenkel and oscillation asymmetries, with explicit barycentric versions.

Conclusion: The technique successfully generalizes quantitative isoperimetric inequalities to new settings, providing stronger control over asymmetries and explicit centers for analysis.

Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different
perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity
functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space,
assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the
boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the
relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the
Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative
isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we
show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the
Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures
how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of
an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a
center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also
derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities
(both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the
derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically
convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection
principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.

*S√∏ren Dyhr,√Ångel Gonz√°lez-Prieto,Eva Miranda,Daniel Peralta-Salas*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper constructs stationary Navier-Stokes solutions on 3D Riemannian manifolds that are Turing complete, demonstrating computational universality under mild geometric conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intersection of fluid dynamics and computation, showing that viscosity doesn't obstruct universality if the geometry meets specific cohomological criteria.

Method: Leverages a link between nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms and cosymplectic geometry, extending the Beltrami fields-Reeb flows correspondence.

Result: Proves Turing completeness of stationary Navier-Stokes solutions on manifolds with nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms.

Conclusion: Computational universality in fluid dynamics is achievable under certain geometric conditions, broadening the scope of fluid-based computation.

Abstract: In this article, we construct stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes
equations on certain Riemannian $3$-manifolds that exhibit Turing completeness,
in the sense that they are capable of performing universal computation. This
universality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus
showing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity,
provided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The
proof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and
cosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between
Beltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds.

*Joel Saucedo,Uday Lamba,Hasitha Mahabaduge*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper resolves ambiguities in plasma-irradiated thin films by developing an exact analytical theory, unifying noise-driven evolution, defect saturation, and nucleation-loss balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile empirical observations of bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws in plasma-irradiated thin films, which existing models fail to explain.

Method: Develops the first exact analytical theory, deriving a closed-form steady-state grain area distribution and establishing a dimensionless threshold for bimodality.

Result: The theory reveals a universal scaling law and explains how competition between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure fragmentation.

Conclusion: The framework resolves long-standing ambiguities and provides a predictive foundation for materials processing under irradiation.

Abstract: A persistent paradox complicates the study of plasma-irradiated thin films,
where bimodal grain distributions and ambiguous scaling laws, roughly shifting
between $\Phi^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi^{-1}$, or a general inverse dependence on
plasma flux, are empirical yet remain theoretically unreconciled. Existing
models fail to unify noise-driven evolution, defect saturation kinetics, and
nucleation-loss balance within a single, self-consistent formalism. This work
resolves these discrepancies by developing the first exact analytical theory
for this system. We derive the closed-form steady-state grain area
distribution, $P_{ss}(A)$, establish the precise dimensionless threshold for
bimodality onset at $\Pi_c = 4/(3\sqrt{3})$, and demonstrate that defect
saturation physics mandate a universal $\langle A \rangle \propto \kappa^2
\Phi^{-1} e^{+2E_b/k_B T_s}$ scaling law. The framework reveals how competition
between stochastic impingement and deterministic growth triggers microstructure
fragmentation, resolving long-standing ambiguities in irradiation-induced
surface evolution and providing a predictive foundation for materials
processing.

### [41] [Robust Lindbladian Estimation for Quantum Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07912)
*Yinchen Liu,James R. Seddon,Tamara Kohler,Emilio Onorati,Toby S. Cubitt*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper improves Lindbladian fitting for quantum process tomography by enhancing logarithm search and integrating gate set tomography for robustness against SPAM errors, validated on simulated and real hardware data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for Lindbladian fitting either rely on theoretical logarithm searches (with non-unique solutions) or practical but ad-hoc approaches. The paper aims to bridge this gap by making logarithm search practical and robust.

Method: The authors introduce algorithmic improvements to logarithm search and combine it with gate set tomography to mitigate SPAM errors. They validate their approach using simulated data and real superconducting-qubit hardware.

Result: The improved method successfully applies logarithm search in practical settings and enhances robustness against SPAM errors, as demonstrated by benchmarks and real hardware experiments.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that logarithm search can be practically applied to Lindbladian fitting in current quantum computing contexts, offering a more systematic and robust alternative to ad-hoc methods.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of
quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached
the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close
to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This
technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so
that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In
contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real
experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead
adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a
particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic
improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in
practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We
additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate
set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement
(SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying
the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using
simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before
demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real
superconducting-qubit hardware.

### [42] [Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07819)
*Sanket Kumawat,Mohit Sharma,Ujjwal Kumar Nandi,Indrajit Tah,Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: The study investigates structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the KALJ model, showing that coarse-graining a structural order parameter reveals growth matching dynamical lengthscales, reconciling previous discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the debate on whether a single lengthscale controls glassy dynamics in systems without medium-range crystalline order (MRCO).

Method: Used the KALJ model in two compositions (80:20 and 60:40), computed dynamical lengthscales from displacement correlations, and analyzed static lengthscales via coarse-grained structural order parameters.

Result: Coarse-graining revealed structural length growth tracking dynamical lengthscales, especially for certain particle types, linking structural order, dynamics, and latent crystallization.

Conclusion: Intermediate-range structural descriptors are necessary to reconcile static and dynamical lengthscales in MRCO-free systems, with implications for understanding glassy dynamics and crystallization.

Abstract: A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether
a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics,
particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs or medium range
crystalline order (MRCO). In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical
lengthscales in supercooled liquids using the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones
(KALJ) model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical
lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a
consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart,
we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging
potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively,
its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by
recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we
perform spatial coarse-graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale
$L_{max}$ that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the
structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse-grained over $L_{max}$
exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical
lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and
B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed
absence of static length growth in MRCO-free models like KALJ by highlighting
the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we
find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to
species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link
between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.
