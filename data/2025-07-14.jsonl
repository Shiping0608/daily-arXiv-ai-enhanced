By rigorously\nconstructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these\npathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By\nsystematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the\nresulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an\norder-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF.
