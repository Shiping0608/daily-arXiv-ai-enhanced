The NSFR scheme has been successfully applied to unsteady\ncompressible flows. Through the use of a bound-preserving limiter, positivity\nof thermodynamic quantities is preserved, and this enables the extension of\nNSFR to hyperbolic conservation laws. We extend the limiter of Zhang and Shu\n[1] to ensure robustness for the proposed scheme. The limiter is modified to\nconsider the minimum density and pressure at the solution nodes when\ndetermining the value to scale the solution. The modifications are thoroughly\ntested with a suite of test cases. In addition to these modifications, this\npaper conducts a thorough investigation into the shock-capturing capabilities\nof the NSFR scheme and the advantages it presents over standard discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) methods, where, on select variants of the flux reconstruction\n(FR) scheme, essentially oscillation-free solutions are demonstrated. Various\nparameters of the scheme are extensively tested and analyzed through several 1D\nand 2D compressible Euler tests that verify the high-order accuracy, entropy\nstability, time step advantage and shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR\nscheme. These parameters include the two-point flux, quadrature nodes and the\nstrength of the FR parameter. In addition to investigating the impact of the\nvarious two-point fluxes, this paper also presents numerical studies to\ndetermine the CFL condition required to maintain positivity for the two-point\nflux of choice. The investigation yields insightful results for all parameters,\nwith the results pertaining to the type of FR scheme being of special interest.\nThe tests showcase increased robustness, time step advantages and\noscillation/overshoot mitigation when employing a stronger FR parameter."}

The effect of\na broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed\nelectron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values\nis investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous\nstudies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband\nprecipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution,\nwhich is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the\ndensity vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the\nPedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the\nconductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally,\nthe Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the\ncorresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances\nare globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution\nrather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct\noutputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression\npresented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron\ncollision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance\nvalues. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation\nenforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the\nfield-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere\nare also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned\ncurrents."}
