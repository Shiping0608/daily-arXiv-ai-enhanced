### [1] [Investigation of Shock-Capturing with Bound-Preserving Limiters for the Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09131)
*Sai Shruthi Srinivasan,Siva Nadarajah*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) scheme for compressible flows, ensuring robustness and positivity via a modified limiter. It demonstrates superior shock-capturing and time-step advantages over standard DG methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the robustness and stability of flux reconstruction schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws while preserving positivity of thermodynamic quantities.

Method: Extends the Zhang and Shu limiter for NSFR, modifies it to consider minimum density and pressure, and tests parameters like two-point flux and FR strength.

Result: NSFR shows high-order accuracy, entropy stability, and improved shock-capturing with oscillation-free solutions. Stronger FR parameters enhance robustness and time-step efficiency.

Conclusion: NSFR is a robust, high-order scheme with advantages over DG methods, validated through extensive 1D and 2D Euler tests.

Abstract: Nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) combines the key properties of
provable nonlinear stability with the increased time step from energy-stable
flux reconstruction. The NSFR scheme has been successfully applied to unsteady
compressible flows. Through the use of a bound-preserving limiter, positivity
of thermodynamic quantities is preserved, and this enables the extension of
NSFR to hyperbolic conservation laws. We extend the limiter of Zhang and Shu
[1] to ensure robustness for the proposed scheme. The limiter is modified to
consider the minimum density and pressure at the solution nodes when
determining the value to scale the solution. The modifications are thoroughly
tested with a suite of test cases. In addition to these modifications, this
paper conducts a thorough investigation into the shock-capturing capabilities
of the NSFR scheme and the advantages it presents over standard discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) methods, where, on select variants of the flux reconstruction
(FR) scheme, essentially oscillation-free solutions are demonstrated. Various
parameters of the scheme are extensively tested and analyzed through several 1D
and 2D compressible Euler tests that verify the high-order accuracy, entropy
stability, time step advantage and shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR
scheme. These parameters include the two-point flux, quadrature nodes and the
strength of the FR parameter. In addition to investigating the impact of the
various two-point fluxes, this paper also presents numerical studies to
determine the CFL condition required to maintain positivity for the two-point
flux of choice. The investigation yields insightful results for all parameters,
with the results pertaining to the type of FR scheme being of special interest.
The tests showcase increased robustness, time step advantages and
oscillation/overshoot mitigation when employing a stronger FR parameter.

### [2] [Crack-tip field characterization in nonlinearly constituted and geometrically linear elastoporous solid containing a star-shaped crack: A finite element study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09263)
*S. M. Mallikarjunaiah,Kun Gou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A 3-D framework for crack-tip fields in star-shaped cracks in porous elastic solids, integrating density-dependent moduli and solved via finite elements and Picard linearization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model crack-tip fields in porous materials more realistically by accounting for density-dependent elastic moduli.

Method: Uses a 3-D quasilinear PDE system with traction-free boundary conditions, solved with trilinear Galerkin finite elements and Picard linearization.

Result: Accurately describes stress/strain states, recovers classical singularities, and shows peak values near crack tips.

Conclusion: The model effectively captures realistic material behavior and aligns with classical fracture mechanics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a three-dimensional (3-D) mathematical and
computational framework for the characterization of crack-tip fields in
star-shaped cracks within porous elastic solids. A core emphasis of this model
is its direct integration of density-dependent elastic moduli, offering a more
physically realistic representation of engineering materials where intrinsic
porosity and density profoundly influence mechanical behavior. The governing
boundary value problem, formulated for the static equilibrium of a 3-D,
homogeneous, and isotropic material, manifests as a system of second-order,
quasilinear partial differential equations. This system is meticulously coupled
with classical traction-free boundary conditions imposed at the complex crack
surface. For the robust numerical solution of this intricate nonlinear problem,
we employ a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element discretization.
The inherent strong nonlinearities arising within the discrete system are
effectively managed through a powerful and stable {Picard-type linearization
scheme}. The proposed model demonstrates a remarkable ability to accurately
describe the full stress and strain states in a diverse range of materials,
crucially recovering the well-established classical singularities observed in
linearized elastic fracture mechanics. A comprehensive numerical examination of
tensile stress, strain, and strain energy density fields consistently reveals
that these quantities attain their peak values in the immediate vicinity of the
crack tip, an observation that remarkably aligns with established findings in
standard linearized elastic fracture mechanics.

### [3] [Benchmark stress tests for flow past a cylinder at higher Reynolds numbers using EMAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09274)
*Henry von Wahl,Leo G. Rebholz,L. Ridgway Scott*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the EMAC formulation of Navier-Stokes equations for flow around a cylinder, showing its advantages over standard methods for low-order elements but instability for higher-order ones on under-resolved meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in simulating periodic flows around a cylinder at Reynolds numbers 500 and 1000, especially for long-time simulations, by incorporating more physical conservation into finite element methods.

Method: The study examines the EMAC formulation, which conserves energy, momentum, and angular momentum, comparing its performance with standard convective formulations using Taylor-Hood elements.

Result: EMAC outperforms standard methods for lowest-order Taylor-Hood elements but becomes unstable for higher-order elements on under-resolved meshes.

Conclusion: EMAC is effective for low-order elements in long-time simulations but requires careful handling for higher-order elements to avoid instability.

Abstract: We consider a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around
a cylinder at Reynolds numbers 500 and 1000, where the solution is observed to
be periodic when the problem is sufficiently resolved. Computing the resulting
flow is a challenge, even for exactly divergence-free discretization methods,
when the scheme does not include sufficient numerical dissipation. We examine
the performance of the energy, momentum and angular momentum conserving (EMAC)
formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. This incorporates more physical
conservation into the finite element method even when the numerical solution is
not exactly divergence-free. Consequently, it has a chance to outperform
standard methods, especially for long-time simulations. We find that for
lowest-order Taylor-Hood elements, EMAC outperforms the standard convective
formulations. However, for higher-order elements, EMAC can become unstable on
under-resolved meshes.

### [4] [Finite element modeling of V-notched thermoelastic strain-limiting solids containing inclusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09300)
*G. Shylaja,V. Kesavulu Naidu,B. Venkatesh,S. M. Mallikarjunaiah*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient FEM for solving thermoelastic problems with V-notches and inclusions, reducing discretization errors and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate numerical approximation of differential operators in collocation methods is crucial for reducing errors in complex thermoelastic models.

Method: A tailored FEM is developed, using higher-order shape functions and a Picard-type linearization scheme to handle nonlinearities and complex boundaries.

Result: Numerical tests show significant accuracy improvements in solving the thermoelastic model.

Conclusion: The proposed FEM effectively addresses nonlinearities and complex geometries, providing precise solutions for thermoelastic problems.

Abstract: A precise domain triangulation is recognized as indispensable for the
accurate numerical approximation of differential operators within collocation
methods, leading to a substantial reduction in discretization errors. An
efficient finite element method (FEM) is presented in this paper, meticulously
developed to solve a complex mathematical model. This model governs the
behavior of thermoelastic solids containing both a V-notch and inclusions. The
system of partial differential equations underlying this model consists of two
primary components: a linear elliptic equation, which is used to describe the
temperature distribution, and a quasilinear equation, which governs the
mechanical behavior of the body. Through the application of this specifically
tailored FEM, accurate and efficient solutions are able to be obtained for
these intricate thermoelastic problems. The algebraically nonlinear
constitutive equation, alongside the balance of linear momentum, is effectively
reduced to a second-order quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation.
Complex curved boundaries are represented through the application of a smooth,
distinctive point transformation. Furthermore, higher-order shape functions are
employed to ensure the accurate computation of entries within the FEM matrices
and vectors, from which a highly precise approximate solution to the BVP is
subsequently obtained. The inherent nonlinearities in the governing
differential equation are addressed through the implementation of a Picard-type
linearization scheme. Numerical results, derived from a series of test cases,
have consistently demonstrated a significant enhancement in accuracy, a crucial
achievement for the nuanced analysis of thermoelastic solids.

### [5] [ORCHA -- A Performance Portability System for Post-Exascale Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09337)
*Youngjun Lee,Klaus Weide,Wesley Kwiecinski,Jared O'Neal,Johann Rudi,Anshu Dubey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: ORCHA is a toolchain developed to address hardware and software heterogeneity in HPC, enabling optimal performance across platforms for complex applications like Flash-X.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity in HPC hardware and growing complexity of applications challenge developers to maintain performance and solution quality.

Method: ORCHA consists of three tools: one for control flow and platform mapping, another for unified data structure and arithmetic variants, and a third for runtime orchestration. It uses code generation and synthesis.

Result: ORCHA successfully enables exploration of optimal configurations for Flash-X, demonstrated through three distinct hardware mappings.

Conclusion: ORCHA provides a flexible solution for managing heterogeneity in HPC, enhancing performance and adaptability for complex applications.

Abstract: Heterogeneity is the prevalent trend in the rapidly evolving high-performance
computing (HPC) landscape in both hardware and application software. The
diversity in hardware platforms, currently comprising various accelerators and
a future possibility of specializable chiplets, poses a significant challenge
for scientific software developers aiming to harness optimal performance across
different computing platforms while maintaining the quality of solutions when
their applications are simultaneously growing more complex. Code synthesis and
code generation can provide mechanisms to mitigate this challenge. We have
developed a toolchain, ORCHA, which arises from the needs of a large
multiphysics simulation software, Flash-X, which were not met by any of the
existing solutions. ORCHA is composed of three stand-alone tools -- one to
express high-level control flow and a map of what to execute where on the
platform, a second one to express variants of data structures and arithmetic
operations in the solvers in a unified fashion, and a third one that manages
the runtime orchestration of the data and computation. We use an
application-specific interface layer that uses code generation and code
synthesis to stitch together the application. In this paper, we describe the
interface layer for the application Flash-X and demonstrate the use of ORCHA in
exploring possible configurations from which the optimal one can be selected
for production, including a case study in which a single simulation recipe is
realized on three distinct hardware mappings -- a GPU-centric, a CPU/GPU
balanced, and a CPU/GPU concurrent layouts -- highlighting the breadth of
configurations ORCHA enables.

### [6] [A discontinuous Galerkin method for one-dimensional nonlocal wave problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09401)
*Qiang Du,Kui Ren,Lu Zhang,Yin Zhou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A fully discrete numerical scheme for 1D nonlocal wave equations is proposed, combining DG spatial discretization and Crank-Nicolson time integration, with proven optimal L2 error convergence and energy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of discretizing nonlocal wave equations and ensure compatibility with classical PDE methods.

Method: Uses an auxiliary variable for spatial DG discretization and Crank-Nicolson for time integration, with theoretical analysis for radial and general kernels.

Result: Optimal L2 error convergence, asymptotic compatibility with local PDEs, and energy preservation are proven. Numerical experiments validate the theory.

Conclusion: The scheme is effective for nonlocal wave equations, bridging nonlocal and classical PDE methods while preserving key properties.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully discrete numerical scheme for one-dimensional
nonlocal wave equations and provides a rigorous theoretical analysis. To
facilitate the spatial discretization, we introduce an auxiliary variable
analogous to the gradient field in local discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods
for classical partial differential equations (PDEs) and reformulate the
equation into a system of equations. The proposed scheme then uses a DG method
for spatial discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method for time integration.
We prove optimal L2 error convergence for both the solution and the auxiliary
variable under a special class of radial kernels at the semi-discrete level. In
addition, for general kernels, we demonstrate the asymptotic compatibility of
the scheme, ensuring that it recovers the classical DG approximation of the
local wave equation in the zero-horizon limit. Furthermore, we prove that the
fully discrete scheme preserves the energy of the nonlocal wave equation. A
series of numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical
findings.

### [7] [A modified tamed scheme for stochastic differential equations with superlinear drifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09475)
*Zichang Ju,Lei Li,Yuliang Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A modified tamed scheme is proposed to address instability in explicit discretizations of stochastic differential equations with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients, preserving accuracy and simplifying analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like truncated and tamed schemes have limitations (e.g., stopping time analysis or reduced accuracy). The goal is to improve stability and accuracy.

Method: Introduces a cut-off function in taming to maintain original order of explicit discretization, with rigorous analysis for Euler discretization. Applied to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.

Result: Achieves uniform-in-time near-sharp error estimate under relative entropy for super-linear drift sampling.

Conclusion: The modified tamed scheme effectively balances stability and accuracy, with practical applications in stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.

Abstract: Explicit discretizations of stochastic differential equations often encounter
instability when the coefficients are not globally Lipschitz. The truncated
schemes and tamed schemes have been proposed to handle this difficulty, but
truncated schemes involve analyzing of the stopping times while the tamed
schemes suffer from the reduced order of accuracy. We propose a modified tamed
scheme by introducing an additional cut-off function in the taming, which
enjoys the convenience for error analysis and preserving the original order of
explicit discretization. While the strategy could be applied to any explicit
discretization, we perform rigorous analysis of the modified tamed scheme for
the Euler discretization as an example. Then, we apply the modified tamed
scheme to the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for sampling with
super-linear drift, and obtain a uniform-in-time near-sharp error estimate
under relative entropy.

### [8] [Bayesian dictionary learning estimation of cell membrane permeability from surface pH data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09651)
*Alberto Bocchinfuso,Daniela Calvetti,Erkki Somersalo*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dictionary learning-based algorithm for estimating cell membrane permeability, challenging traditional diffusion theories and offering computational efficiency over particle filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to resolve the debate between Overton's diffusion theory and the gas channel hypothesis for gas transport across cell membranes, using mathematical models due to insufficient experimental evidence.

Method: The authors introduce a dictionary learning algorithm to estimate membrane permeability, applicable when membrane properties remain constant during data collection.

Result: The proposed method is shown to be computationally more efficient than the particle filter approach used in prior work.

Conclusion: The dictionary learning algorithm provides a viable and efficient alternative for estimating cell membrane permeability, supporting further investigation into gas transport mechanisms.

Abstract: Gas transport across cell membrane is a very important process in
biochemistry which is essential for many crucial tasks, including cell
respiration pH regulation in the cell. In the late 1990's, the suggestion that
gasses are transported via preferred gas channels embedded into the cell
membrane challenged the century old Overton's theory that gases pass through
the lipid cell membrane by diffusing across the concentration gradient. Since
experimental evidence alone does not provide enough evidence to favor one of
the proposed mechanisms, mathematical models have been introduced to provide a
context for the interpretation of laboratory measurement. Following up on
previous work where the membrane permeability was estimated using particle
filter, in this article we propose an algorithm based on dictionary learning
for estimating cell membrane permeability. Computed examples illustrate that
the novel approach, which can be applied when the properties of the membrane do
not change in the course of the data collection process, is computationally
much more efficient than particle filter.

### [9] [Pyramid transforms via nonstationary subdivision schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09668)
*Hadar Landau,Wael Mattar,Nir Sharon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces nonstationary subdivision schemes for pyramid transforms, enhancing flexibility in multiscale analysis, especially for geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pyramid transforms use stationary upsampling/downsampling, limiting flexibility. Nonstationary schemes can better capture geometric structures.

Method: Proposes nonstationary subdivision schemes as upsampling operators, varying by refinement level. Analyzes their properties and applications.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in capturing geometric features, with applications in detecting structures in planar objects.

Conclusion: Nonstationary schemes offer advanced multiscale analysis, particularly useful for geometric feature detection.

Abstract: Pyramid transforms are constructive methods for analyzing sequences in a
multiscale fashion. Traditionally, these transforms rely on stationary
upsampling and downsampling operations. In this paper, we propose employing
nonstationary subdivision schemes as upsampling operators that vary according
to the refinement level. These schemes offer greater flexibility, enabling the
development of advanced multiscale transforms, including geometric multiscale
analysis. We establish the fundamental properties of these nonstationary
operators and demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing and analyzing
geometric features. In particular, we present applications to highlight their
utility in detecting geometric structures in planar objects.

### [10] [Energy Dissipation Rate Guided Adaptive Sampling for Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Resolving Surface-Bulk Dynamics in Allen-Cahn Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09757)
*Chunyan Li,Wenkai Yu,Qi Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: EDRAS enhances PINNs by using energy dissipation rate to guide adaptive sampling, improving accuracy and efficiency in solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of PINNs in solving thermodynamically consistent PDEs by aligning training with physical system structure.

Method: EDRAS dynamically samples critical collocation points using local energy dissipation rate density.

Result: Achieves up to sixfold error reduction and outperforms traditional RAR methods in efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: EDRAS is an effective, physics-informed enhancement for PINNs, making them robust for complex thermodynamic processes.

Abstract: We introduce the Energy Dissipation Rate guided Adaptive Sampling (EDRAS)
strategy, a novel method that substantially enhances the performance of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving thermodynamically
consistent partial differential equations (PDEs) over arbitrary domains. EDRAS
leverages the local energy dissipation rate density as a guiding metric to
identify and adaptively re-sample critical collocation points from both the
interior and boundary of the computational domain. This dynamical sampling
approach improves the accuracy of residual-based PINNs by aligning the training
process with the underlying physical structure of the system. In this study, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of EDRAS using the Allen-Cahn phase field model
in irregular geometries, achieving up to a sixfold reduction in the relative
mean square error compared to traditional residual-based adaptive refinement
(RAR) methods. Moreover, we compare EDRAS with other residual-based adaptive
sampling approaches and show that EDRAS is not only computationally more
efficient but also more likely to identify high-impact collocation points.
Through numerical solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation with both static
(Neumann) and dynamic boundary conditions in 2D disk- and ellipse-shaped
domains solved using PINN coupled with EDRAS, we gain significant insights into
how dynamic boundary conditions influence bulk phase evolution and
thermodynamic behavior. The proposed approach offers an effective, physically
informed enhancement to PINN frameworks for solving thermodynamically
consistent models, making PINN a robust and versatile computational tool for
investigating complex thermodynamic processes in arbitrary geometries.

*Muhammad Luthfi Shahab,Fidya Almira Suheri,Rudy Kusdiantara,Hadi Susanto*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is introduced for solving nonlinear lattice challenges, including solution approximation, bifurcation diagrams, and stability analysis, showing high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges in nonlinear lattices, such as solution approximation and stability analysis, using scalable and efficient neural network tools.

Method: Employ PINNs with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solution approximation, stochastic sampling for efficiency, and coupling with continuation for bifurcation diagrams. Adapt PINNs for stability analysis with output constraints.

Result: The method achieves accuracy comparable to or better than traditional methods, especially in high-dimensional settings, as demonstrated on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation.

Conclusion: Neural networks, particularly PINNs, are promising for scalable and efficient study of complex nonlinear lattice systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for addressing key challenges in nonlinear lattices, including solution
approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis.
We first employ PINNs to approximate solutions of nonlinear systems arising
from lattice models, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize
network weights for greater accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency in
high-dimensional settings, we integrate a stochastic sampling strategy. We then
extend the method by coupling PINNs with a continuation approach to compute
snaking bifurcation diagrams, incorporating an auxiliary equation to
effectively track successive solution branches. For linear stability analysis,
we adapt PINNs to compute eigenvectors, introducing output constraints to
enforce positivity, in line with Sturm-Liouville theory. Numerical experiments
are conducted on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation with cubic and quintic
nonlinearities in one to five spatial dimensions. The results demonstrate that
the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to, or better than,
traditional numerical methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where
computational resources are a limiting factor. These findings highlight the
potential of neural networks as scalable and efficient tools for the study of
complex nonlinear lattice systems.

*Xuelong Gu,Qi Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A swarming optimization framework is proposed, coupling agents' dynamics and using energy-stable algorithms to enhance convergence toward global minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve swarm-based optimization by dynamically coupling agents' inertia, positions, and masses, leveraging controlled energy dissipation.

Method: Formulated as a dissipative dynamical system, solved with energy-stable algorithms preserving or enhancing energy dissipation.

Result: Convergence toward low local minima, outperforming traditional swarm-based gradient descent, especially with fewer agents.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances optimization performance, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: We formulate the swarming optimization problem as a weakly coupled,
dissipative dynamical system governed by a controlled energy dissipation rate
and initial velocities that adhere to the nonequilibrium Onsager principle. In
this framework, agents' inertia, positions, and masses are dynamically coupled.
To numerically solve the system, we develop a class of efficient, energy-stable
algorithms that either preserve or enhance energy dissipation at the discrete
level. At equilibrium, the system tends to converge toward one of the lowest
local minima explored by the agents, thereby improving the likelihood of
identifying the global minimum. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed approach, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional
swarm-based gradient descent methods, especially when operating with a limited
number of agents.

Motivation: Standard finite element methods produce spurious oscillations for nonsmooth solutions in hyperbolic differential equations, which is problematic for accurate DNA transcription modeling.

Method: Incorporates stabilization terms with spatial and temporal filtering into the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards Model. Analyzes backward Euler and time-filtered formulations for stability and convergence.

Result: Proves numerical stability and convergence for the proposed methods. Computational results demonstrate spatial and temporal rates, as well as applicability to biological scenarios.

Conclusion: The stabilization technique effectively mitigates spurious oscillations and ensures reliable numerical solutions for hyperbolic differential equations in DNA transcription modeling.

Abstract: This work studies a stabilization technique for first-order hyperbolic
differential equations used in DNA transcription modeling. Specifically we use
the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards Model with a nonlinear Greenshield's velocity
proposed in [1]. Standard finite element methods are known to produce spurious
oscillations when applied to nonsmooth solutions. To address this, we
incorporate stabilization terms involving spatial and temporal filtering into
the system. We present numerical stability and prove convergence results for
both the backwards Euler and time filtered formulations. We also present
several computational results to demonstrate the rates in space and in time as
well as for selected biological scenarios.

### [14] [A structural bound for cluster robustness of randomized small-block Lanczos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10144)
*Nian Shao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Randomized Small-Block Lanczos (RSBL) method to improve cluster robustness in eigenvalue problems, provides a theoretical bound, and validates it empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Lanczos method struggles with clustered eigenvalues due to lack of cluster robustness. RSBL aims to address this without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency.

Method: The RSBL method uses a random small-block initial to enhance cluster robustness. Theoretical analysis leverages matrix polynomials and addresses non-commuting matrix multiplication.

Result: A structural bound for RSBL's cluster robustness is developed, and a conjectured probabilistic bound is empirically validated.

Conclusion: Insights into cluster robustness improve understanding of RSBL for eigenvalue computation and low-rank approximation.

Abstract: The Lanczos method is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for solving
large-scale symmetric eigenvalue problems. However, its rapid convergence can
deteriorate significantly when computing clustered eigenvalues due to a lack of
cluster robustness. A promising strategy to enhance cluster robustness --
without substantially compromising convergence speed or memory efficiency -- is
to use a random small-block initial, where the block size is greater than one
but still much smaller than the cluster size. This leads to the Randomized
Small-Block Lanczos (RSBL) method. Despite its empirical effectiveness, RSBL
lacks the comprehensive theoretical understanding already available for
single-vector and large-block variants. In this paper, we develop a structural
bound that supports the cluster robustness of RSBL by leveraging tools from
matrix polynomials. We identify an intrinsic theoretical challenge stemming
from the non-commuting nature of matrix multiplication. To provide further
insight, we propose a conjectured probabilistic bound for cluster robustness
and validate it through empirical experiments. Finally, we discuss how insights
into cluster robustness can enhance our understanding of RSBL for both
eigenvalue computation and low-rank approximation.

*Andrew Scharf,Martina Bukač,Sunčica Čanić*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper develops a numerical scheme for simulating fluid-structure interaction in multilayered poroelastic structures, validated with biological applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological tissues like cartilage and bioartificial organs inspire the study of fluid-poroelastic structure interactions.

Method: A partitioned numerical scheme combines backward Euler Stokes-Biot splitting and fixed-strain Biot splitting to decouple fluid and structure problems.

Result: The scheme is stable under specific conditions, validated with manufactured solutions and applied to blood vessel flow.

Conclusion: The method converges to the limiting case without the plate, confirming its robustness.

Abstract: Multilayered poroelastic structures are found in many biological tissues such
as cartilage and the cornea, and play a key role in the design of bioartificial
organs and other bioengineering applications. Motivated by these applications,
we study the interaction between a free fluid flow, governed by the
time-dependent Stokes equations, and a multilayered poroelastic structure
composed of a thick Biot layer and a thin, linear poroelastic plate located at
the interface. The resulting equations are linearly coupled across the thin
structure domain through physical coupling conditions. We develop a partitioned
numerical scheme for this poroelastic fluid-structure interaction problem,
combining the backward Euler Stokes-Biot splitting method with the fixed-strain
Biot splitting approach. The first decouples the Stokes problem from the
multilayered structure problem, while the second decouples the flow and
mechanical subproblems within the poroelastic structures. Stability of the
splitting scheme is proven under different combinations of time-step conditions
and parameter constraints. The method is validated using manufactured
solutions, and further applied to a biologically inspired blood vessel flow
problem. We also demonstrate convergence of the solution to the limiting case
without the plate as its thickness tends to zero, providing additional
validation of the numerical method.

Motivation: To address the challenge of finding exact solutions for nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are often complex and lack closed-form solutions.

Method: An iterative approach providing rapidly converging series solutions, applied to the extended (2 + 1) dimensional thermophoretic motion equation.

Result: Closed-form solutions in terms of exponential, hyperbolic, trigonometric, algebraic, and Jacobi elliptic functions, with three solutions illustrating thermophoretic wave characteristics.

Conclusion: The method is efficient and yields exact, unique solutions, outperforming traditional methods like variation of parameters for nonlinear problems.

Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach for determining exact solutions to
nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The recommended iterative method
provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a
closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially
perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional
equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in
graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested
approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential
functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions,
and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions
illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene
sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined.
Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of
parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact
and unique.

*Zachary Mullaghy*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Divergence-Free Radiant Transform (DFRT) for divergence-free vector fields, with applications in fluid dynamics. It covers construction, properties, and algebraic structures, linking to cohomology and offering insights into regularity and singularity prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a spectral transform tailored to divergence-free vector fields, particularly in incompressible fluid dynamics and solenoidal systems.

Method: Constructs DFRT basis functions using a curl-based formulation, defines forward/inverse transforms, proves Parseval identity, and establishes basis completeness. Introduces a spectral coboundary operator and links it to cohomology.

Result: Develops DFRT with proven properties, derives modal evolution equations for Navier-Stokes, and shows entropy-maximizing distributions lead to exponential decay.

Conclusion: DFRT provides a rigorous framework for analyzing divergence-free systems, with potential applications in fluid dynamics and cohomological structures.

Abstract: This paper presents the rigorous mathematical construction and foundational
properties of the Divergence-Free Radiant Transform (DFRT), a spectral
transform specifically designed for divergence-free vector fields, with
applications in incompressible fluid dynamics and other solenoidal systems. The
DFRT basis functions are constructed using a curl-based formulation that
ensures the divergence-free condition is satisfied identically. We define the
forward and inverse transforms, prove the Parseval identity, and establish the
completeness of the basis. The DFRT coefficient space is equipped with an
algebraic structure via a spectral coboundary operator, defined using Wigner 3j
and 6j symbols to encode angular momentum coupling. This cohomological
structure, and its connection to the Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT), is
developed in a companion paper using a bigraded cohomology framework. We derive
a modal evolution equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in
DFRT coordinates and introduce a persistent regularity class based on
cohomological constraints. Finally, we present a variational argument showing
that an entropy-maximizing energy distribution leads to exponential decay,
offering a new perspective on regularity and singularity prevention in
incompressible flows.

*Micah Warren*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper uses a Korevaar-style maximum principle to prove that, under a $C^{2}$ bound on log densities, a quantifiable Wasserstein neighborhood ensures smooth optimal transport despite unfavorable MTW curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in optimal transport caused by unhelpful MTW curvature, focusing on smooth measures with bounded log densities.

Method: A Korevaar-style maximum principle is applied, analyzing the Kantorovich potential's gradient and Hessian to ensure boundedness along a continuity path.

Result: The Hessian remains bounded under the given conditions, ensuring smooth optimal transport in the specified Wasserstein neighborhood.

Conclusion: The approach successfully guarantees smooth optimal transport in the presence of MTW curvature by leveraging boundedness properties of the Hessian.

Abstract: We use a Korevaar-style maximum principle approach to show the following:
Fixing a $C^{2}$ bound on the log densities of a set of smooth measures, there
is a quantifiably-sized Wasserstein neighborhood over which all pairs of such
measures will enjoy smooth optimal transport. \ We do this in spite of
unhelpful MTW\ curvature, by showing that when the gradient of the Kantorovich
potential is small enough, the Hessian ``bound" places the Hessian in one of
two disconnected regions, one bounded and the other unbounded. \ Tracking the
estimate along a continuity path which starts in the bounded region, we
conclude the Hessian must stay bounded.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes an age-structured SIS epidemic model with reaction-diffusion, Neumann boundary conditions, and a blow-up death rate. It establishes solution existence, derives the basic reproduction number, and studies disease-free equilibrium stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of age-structured SIS epidemics with complex mortality rates and boundary conditions.

Method: Uses age-structured semigroup theory for solution existence, linearization for the basic reproduction number, and ω-limit set techniques for stability analysis.

Result: Existence of solutions is proven, and disease-free equilibrium stability is shown when the reproduction number is below 1.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into epidemic dynamics but highlights limitations due to non-separable mortality rates and lack of comparison principles.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spatio-temporal dynamics of an
age-structured reaction-diffusion system of KPP-epidemic type (SIS), subject to
Neumann boundary conditions and incorporating $L^1$ blow-up type death rate. We
first establish the existence of time dependent solutions using age-structured
semigroup theory. Afterward, the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ is
derived by linearizing the system around the disease-free equilibrium state. In
the case $\mathcal{R}_0<1$, the existence, uniqueness and stability of
disease-free equilibrium are shown by using $\omega$-limit set approach of
Langlais \cite{langlais_large_1988}, combined with the technique developed in
recent works of Zhao et al. \cite{zhao_spatiotemporal_2023} and Ducrot et al.
\cite{ducrot_age-structured_2024}. We highlight that the absence of a general
comparison principle for the age-structured SIS-model and non-separable
variable mortality rate prevent the direct application of the semi-flow
technique developed in \cite{ducrot_age-structured_2024} to study the long time
dynamics.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies the existence of positive ground state solutions for a linearly coupled Kirchhoff--Choquard system in ℝ³ using a variational approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the existence of solutions under specific conditions for the coupled system, extending previous work on variational methods.

Method: A variational approach based on the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold, inspired by prior research, is employed to find ground state solutions.

Result: Ground state solutions are obtained under certain conditions, even in critical cases, by adjusting parameters like μ or ν.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends regularity results and validates the Pohozaev identity, providing solutions for the coupled system.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following linearly coupled Kirchhoff--Choquard
system in $\mathbb{R}^3$: \begin{align*} \begin{cases} -\left(a_1 +
b_1\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2\,dx\right)\Delta u + V_1 u = \mu
(I_{\alpha} * |u|^p) |u|^{p - 2} u + \lambda v, \ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3\\
-\left(a_2 + b_2\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla v|^2\,dx\right)\Delta v + V_2 v =
\nu (I_{\alpha} * |v|^q) |v|^{q - 2} v + \lambda u,\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^3 \\ u, v
\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3),
  \end{cases} \end{align*} where $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, V_1, V_2$, $\lambda$,
$\mu$ and $\nu$ are positive constants. The function $I_{\alpha} : \mathbb{R}^3
\setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Riesz potential with $\alpha \in
(0, 3)$.
  We study the existence of positive ground state solutions under the
conditions $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} < p \le q < 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 +
\alpha}{3} < p < q = 3 + \alpha$, or $\frac{3 + \alpha}{3} = p < q < 3 +
\alpha$. Assuming suitable conditions on $V_1$, $V_2$, and $\lambda$, we obtain
a ground state solution by employing a variational approach based on the
Nehari--Pohozaev manifold, inspired by the works of Ueno (Commun. Pure Appl.
Anal. 24 (2025)) and Chen--Liu (J. Math. Anal. 473 (2019)).
  In particular, we emphasize that in the upper half critical case $\frac{3 +
\alpha}{3} < p < q = 3 + \alpha$ and the lower half critical case $\frac{3 +
\alpha}{3} = p < q < 3 + \alpha$, a ground state solution can still be obtained
by taking $\mu$ or $\nu$ sufficiently large to control the energy level of the
minimization problem.
  To employ the Nehari--Pohozaev manifold we extend a regularity result to the
linearly coupled system, which is essential for the validity of the Pohozaev
identity.

Result: Key results include insights into overdetermined problems, Harnack inequalities for antisymmetric solutions, and new geometric identities involving fractional mean curvature.

Conclusion: The thesis advances understanding of symmetry and geometry in nonlocal PDEs, with applications to stability estimates and geometric analysis.

Abstract: In this thesis, we explore several related topics broadly regarding the
symmetry and geometric properties of nonlocal partial differential equations
(PDE). This thesis is split into three parts. In the first part, we study two
overdetermined problems, namely Serrin's problem and the parallel surface
problem, driven by the fractional Laplacian. In the second part, we study the
Harnack inequality for solutions to nonlocal PDE which are antisymmetric, that
is, they have an odd symmetry with respect to reflections across some
hyperplane. This topic has a strong motivation coming from proving quantitative
stability estimates for nonlocal overdetermined problems. In the third part, we
prove several geometric identities and inequalities involving the fractional
mean curvature.

TL;DR: The paper studies weak-strong uniqueness for the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in 3D, introducing a new uniqueness criterion to handle nonlinear challenges from parameter ξ. It also reveals a new weak-strong uniqueness regime for ξ=0 and proves global well-posedness for small initial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of weak-strong uniqueness results for the Beris-Edwards model, especially with arbitrary parameter ξ, and to overcome nonlinear difficulties introduced by ξ.

Method: Proposes a new uniqueness criterion using (ΔQ,∇u) with L_t^qL_x^p regularity (2/q + 3/p = 3/2, 2 ≤ p ≤ 6) to manage ξ-related nonlinearities.

Result: Establishes weak-strong uniqueness for the model, including a new regime for ξ=0, and proves global well-posedness for small initial data in H^s.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for analyzing the Beris-Edwards model, extending weak-strong uniqueness results and demonstrating global well-posedness for small data.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the weak-strong uniqueness for the Leray-Hopf type
weak solutions to the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ with an arbitrary parameter $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$, which measures
the ratio of tumbling and alignment effects caused by the flow. This result is
obtained by proposing a new uniqueness criterion in terms of $(\Delta Q,\nabla
u)$ with regularity $L_t^qL_x^p$ for $\frac{2}{q}+\frac{3}{p}=\frac{3}{2}$ and
$2\leq p\leq 6$, which enable us to deal with the additional nonlinear
difficulties arising from the parameter $\xi$. Comparing with the related
literature, our finding also reveals a new regime of weak-strong uniqueness for
the simplified case of $\xi=0$. Moreover, we establish the global
well-posedness of this model for small initial data in $H^s$-framework.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for analyzing generalized solutions in Hilbert spaces, with practical applications in transport and Euler equations, and highlights the role of operator properties in solution uniqueness.

Abstract: We study generalized solutions of an evolutionary equation related to a

existence of a contractive semigroup, which provides generalized solutions, and
find criteria of uniqueness of generalized solutions. Some applications are
given including the transport equations and the linearised Euler equations with
solenoidal (and generally discontinuous) coefficients. Under some additional

Motivation: To understand the decay behavior of solitary wave solutions in the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation, building on previous work.

Motivation: To understand the stability of vortex sheets under large perturbations and small Mach numbers, addressing challenges in nonlinear interactions and decay rates.

Method: Introduces an auxiliary flow, reformulates the problem, uses frequency decomposition, and exploits cancellation properties in zero modes. Also employs anti-derivative techniques for decay rate analysis.

Result: Derives global estimates for strong solutions uniform in Mach number and justifies the incompressible limit.

Conclusion: The study successfully analyzes vortex sheet stability, revealing essential cancellation properties and enabling uniform global estimates, with implications for incompressible limits.

Abstract: This paper concerns the global nonlinear stability of vortex sheets for the
Navier-Stokes equations. When the Mach number is small, we allow both the
amplitude and vorticity of the vortex sheets to be large. We introduce an
auxiliary flow and reformulate the problem as a vortex sheet with small
vorticity but subjected to a large perturbation. Based on the decomposition of
frequency, the largeness of the perturbation is encoded in the zero modes of
the tangential velocity. We discover an essential cancellation property that
there are no nonlinear interactions among these large zero modes in the
zero-mode perturbed system. This cancellation is owing to the shear structure
inherent in the vortex sheets. Furthermore, with the aid of the anti-derivative
technique, we establish a faster decay rate for the large zero modes.These
observations enable us to derive the global estimates for strong solutions that
are uniform with respect to the Mach number. As a byproduct, we can justify the
incompressible limit.

Motivation: To understand the impact of obstacles, velocity at infinity, and circulation on vortex patch flows in steady Euler flows.

Method: Uses a new Green's function, stable minima of Kirchhoff-Routh functions, and kinetic energy maximizers to construct flows.

Result: Demonstrates how obstacle, velocity, and circulation affect the existence of vortex patch flows.

Conclusion: The interplay of obstacle, velocity, and circulation is crucial for the existence of vortex patch flows.

Abstract: We consider the steady Euler flows past an obstacle in an infinity long strip
with horizontal constant velocity at infinity, prescribed circulation around
the obstacle and sharply concentrated patch-type vorticity. The construction of
these flows are based on the structure of a new Green's function, the existence
of stable minimum points of the Kirchhoff-Routh functions and the existence of
maximizers of the kinetic energy for the vorticity. We mainly focus on the
effect from the obstacle, the velocity at infinity and the circulation around
the obstacle on the existence of minimum points of the Kirchhoff-Routh
function, and hence on the existence of vortex patch flows.

Motivation: To establish a global $L^\infty$-estimate for solutions of the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation and apply it to decay estimates and minimizer comparisons.

Method: The authors derive an $L^\infty$-estimate for solutions and use it to prove decay estimates via nonlinear Wolff potentials. They then apply these results to compare minimizers in different function spaces.

Result: A new $L^\infty$-estimate is obtained, leading to decay estimates and a Brezis-Nirenberg type result for minimizers.

Conclusion: The findings provide tools for analyzing solutions of the fractional $p$-Laplacian equation and their properties in various function spaces.

Abstract: In this paper we present a new global $L^\infty$-estimate for solutions $u\in

$$ \|u\|_{\infty}\le C \Phi(\|u\|_{\beta}) $$ % for some $\beta> p$, where
$\Phi: \R^+\to \R^+$ is a data independent function with $\lim_{s\to

estimate based on pointwise estimates in terms of nonlinear Wolff potentials.
Taking advantage of both the $L^\infty$ and decay estimate we prove a
Brezis-Nirenberg type result regarding $D^{s,2}(\R^N)$ versus $C_b\left(\R^N,

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper explores exponential stabilization of a two-string system with a dynamic interior mass, using three feedback mechanisms, and proves unconditional exponential stability without constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon earlier results that required additional structural conditions for exponential decay, by analyzing combined feedback mechanisms.

Method: Uses a Lyapunov framework to analyze boundary damping, higher-order nodal damping, and lower-order nodal damping.

Result: Exponential stability is achieved unconditionally, and lower-order feedback can be removed without losing stability.

Conclusion: The findings apply to hybrid systems like cranes and cables, validated by simulations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the exponential stabilization of a coupled two-string
system joined by a dynamic interior mass. The combined effect of three feedback
mechanisms, boundary damping from tip velocity, higher-order nodal damping from
angular velocity, and lower-order nodal damping from mass velocity, is analyzed
using a Lyapunov framework. Exponential stability is established
unconditionally, without constraints on wave speeds or mass location, improving
upon earlier results that lower-order nodal damping, as in {Hansen-Zuazua'95},
or boundary damping alone, as in {Lee-You'89}, does not ensure exponential
decay without additional structural conditions. Moreover, the lower-order
feedback can be removed without loss of exponential decay when combined with
the other two mechanisms, via a compact perturbation argument. These results
apply to hybrid systems with interior or tip mass interfaces, including
overhead cranes, deep-sea cables, and fluid structure interaction. Theoretical
findings are validated through numerical simulations.

### [35] [Adaptive dynamics of nonlocal competition models with heterogeneous resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09572)
*Shen Bian*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies the long-time behavior of phenotype-structured models for asexual populations, focusing on nonlocal interactions and resource heterogeneity. It analyzes two scenarios: one without diffusion and phenotypic changes, and another with diffusion and heritable changes, proving convergence to fitness peaks and steady states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how nonlocal interactions and resource distributions impact the evolutionary dynamics of asexual populations, particularly in terms of trait selection and long-term behavior.

Method: The study uses integro-differential and reaction-diffusion systems, employing entropy methods and transformations to address nonlocal interactions and resource heterogeneity. Numerical experiments complement theoretical proofs.

Result: For the first scenario, the species converges to a Dirac mass at the fitness peak. For the second, distinct steady states emerge, concentrated at resource maxima. Numerical results support and extend theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates how resource heterogeneity and nonlocal interactions shape evolutionary outcomes, with theoretical and numerical insights into trait selection and steady-state behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of phenotype-structured models
describing evolutionary dynamics of asexual populations, and analyze the joint
effects of nonlocal interactions and spatial resource distributions on the
global dynamics of the two species. In the first part, we consider an
integro-differential system without diffusion terms, where phenotypic changes
are absent and the spatial distribution of resources for one species is
heterogeneous while that of the other is homogeneous. Using an entropy method
to address nonlocal interactions and resource heterogeneity, we prove that the
species subject to heterogeneous resources converges to a Dirac mass
concentrated at the peak of the phenotypic fitness landscape, which establishes
the selection of the best adapted trait. Numerical experiments further provide
a sufficient criterion to identify the positions of fitness peaks. In the
second part, we extend our study to a nonlocal reaction-diffusion system
involving a linear diffusion operator, where heritable phenotypic changes occur
and both resources are spatially heterogeneous. Through an appropriate
transformation, we overcome the challenges induced by resource heterogeneity
and prove that the long-time limits of the two species under different
interspecific competitive coefficients are given by distinct steady states of
the parabolic system, with concentrations at the maxima of their respective
resource functions. Numerical results confirm the predictions and further
reveal phenomena beyond the theoretical analysis.

*Elissa Eggenweiler,Iryna Rybak*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper extends generalized interface conditions for coupling free-flow and porous-medium flow, proving rigorous error estimates and validating them numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coupling conditions are limited to flows parallel to the interface, necessitating more accurate generalized conditions for arbitrary flow directions.

Method: The authors use homogenization and boundary layer theory to derive higher-order interface conditions, compute effective parameters numerically, and validate them against pore-scale resolved models.

Result: The new coupling conditions are more accurate than traditional and previously generalized conditions, with rigorous error estimates provided.

Conclusion: The derived higher-order terms in the coupling conditions significantly improve accuracy, highlighting their importance for precise numerical simulations.

Abstract: The choice of interface conditions for coupling free-flow and porous-medium
flow systems is crucial in order to obtain accurate coupled flow models and
precise numerical simulation results. Typically, the Stokes equations are
considered in the free-flow region, Darcy's law is applied in the porous
medium, and traditional coupling conditions (conservation of mass, balance of
normal forces, the Beavers-Joseph condition on tangential velocity) are set on
the interface. However, these traditional conditions are applicable to flows
parallel to the fluid-porous interface only. Recently, we derived generalized
interface conditions accounting for arbitrary flow directions to the porous
layer using homogenization and boundary layer theory. We validated these
conditions numerically and demonstrated that they are more accurate than the
traditional coupling conditions. However, error estimates have not been derived
yet. In this paper, we extend the generalized coupling conditions and prove
rigorous error estimates for the homogenization result. All effective
parameters appearing in the developed higher-order interface conditions are
computed numerically based on the pore geometry. We validate the derived
conditions by comparing numerical simulation results for the coupled
Stokes-Darcy model and the pore-scale resolved model. Moreover, we compare the
new coupling conditions to the traditional as well as generalized interface
conditions and highlight the importance of the additional higher-order terms
appearing in the derived coupling concept.

Motivation: To generalize the extension of $BMO^{x}$ functions beyond a local cube to the entire space without significantly altering their seminorm properties.

Method: Proving the extension of $BMO^{x}$ functions from a cube to $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ while nearly preserving the $[a]^{\sharp}$ seminorm, which combines $L_{\infty}$-norm in $t$ and $BMO$-norm in $x$.

Result: Successful extension of $BMO^{x}$ functions to $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ with minimal change to the $[a]^{\sharp}$ seminorm.

Conclusion: The method effectively extends $BMO^{x}$ functions globally while maintaining their seminorm properties, providing a useful tool for analysis in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We prove that one can extend any $BMO^{x}$ function $a$ given in a cube in
$\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ to become a $BMO^{x}$ functions $\hat a$ in
$\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ almost preserving its $[a]^{\sharp}$ seminorm, which is,
loosely speaking, $L_{\infty}$-norm of the maximal function in $t$ and
$BMO$-norm in $x$.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of multiple normalized solutions to the

u+V(\varepsilon x)u + \lambda_1 |u|^{2}u + \lambda_2(K\ast|u|^{2})u +

$2<p<\frac{10}{3}$, $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Lagrange multiplier,
$\lambda_3<0$, $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2) \in \left\lbrace (\lambda_1,\lambda_2)
\in \mathbb{R}^{2}:\lambda_1<\frac{4\pi}{3}\lambda_2\le 0\; \text{or}\;

(x)}{|x|^{3}}$ and $\theta (x)$ is the angle between the dipole axis determined
by $(0,0,1)$ and the vector $x$. Under some assumptions of $V$, we use
variational methods to prove that the number of normalized solutions is not
less than the number of global minimum points of $V$ if $\varepsilon> 0$ is

### [41] [Improved Hölder regularity of fractional $(p,q)$-Poisson equation with regular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09920)
*Anup Biswas,Aniket Sen*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves quantitative Hölder continuity for viscosity solutions of a nonlocal equation with Hölder continuous coefficients, extending prior results and providing Lipschitz estimates under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize existing results on Hölder continuity for solutions of nonlocal equations by incorporating Hölder continuous modulating coefficients and improving Lipschitz estimates.

Method: The authors analyze viscosity solutions to a nonlocal equation involving fractional Laplacians and Hölder continuous terms, deriving explicit Hölder exponents.

Result: Solutions are shown to be locally Hölder continuous with explicit exponents, and locally Lipschitz under specific conditions, extending prior work.

Conclusion: The results generalize and improve existing estimates for nonlocal equations, particularly for Hölder continuous coefficients, and bridge gaps in the literature.

Abstract: We prove a quantitative H\"{o}lder continuity result for viscosity solutions
to the equation $$ (-\Delta_p)^{s}u(x) + {\rm PV} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
|u(x)-u(x+z)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(x+z))\frac{\xi(x,z)}{|z|^{n+ tq}} dz=f \quad
\text{in}\; B_2, $$ where $t, s\in (0, 1), 1<p\leq q, tq\leq sp$ and $\xi\geq
0$. Specifically, we show that if $\xi$ is $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder continuous and
$f$ is $\beta$-H\"{o}lder continuous then any viscosity solution is locally
$\gamma$-H\"{o}lder continuous for any $\gamma<\gamma_\circ $, where \[
\gamma_\circ=\left\{\begin{array}{lll} \min\{1,
\frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}, \frac{sp}{p-2}\} & \text{for}\; p>2, \\
\min\{1, \frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}\} & \text{for}\; p\in (1, 2].
\end{array} \right. \] Moreover, if $\min\{\frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1},
\frac{sp}{p-2}\}>1$ when $p>2$, or $\frac{sp+\alpha\wedge\beta}{p-1}>1$ when
$p\in (1, 2]$, the solution is locally Lipschitz. This extends the result of
[20] to the case of H\"{o}lder continuous modulating coefficients.
Additionally, due to the equivalence between viscosity and weak solutions, our
result provides a local Lipschitz estimate for weak solutions of
$(-\Delta_p)^{s}u(x)=0$ provided either $p\in (1, 2]$ or $sp>p-2$ when $p>2$,
thereby improving recent works [9, 10, 24].

Motivation: To extend understanding of parabolic equations with superlinear terms, addressing gaps in previous work.

Conclusion: The study provides consistent insights into solutions for such equations, reinforcing existing frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we study existence and regularity for solutions to parabolic
equations having a superlinear lower order term depending on both the solution
and its gradient. Two different situations are analyzed. On the one hand, we
assume that the initial datum belongs to an Orlicz space of exponentially
summable functions. On the other, data in an appropriate Lebesgue space
satisfying a smallness condition are considered. Our results are coherent with
those of previous papers in similar frameworks.

TL;DR: Uniqueness and stability for recovering wave speed and initial condition from a single boundary measurement in 3D wave equation, relevant to TAT/PAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of recovering wave speed and initial conditions from limited data, with applications in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography.

Method: Uses frequency-domain solution representations and properties of elliptic/hyperbolic equations to relax previous constraints.

Result: Establishes uniqueness and Hölder stability for piecewise constant sound speeds, even with unknown inclusion locations.

Conclusion: Extends applicability to broader cases in TAT/PAT by reducing stringent conditions.

Abstract: This article addresses the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering both
the wave speed coefficient and an unknown initial condition for the
multidimensional wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement.
Specifically, we establish uniqueness and H\"{o}lder stability estimates for
determining these parameters in the wave equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, where only
a single boundary measurement of the solution--generated by the unknown initial
data--is available. Our work connects to thermoacoustic and photoacoustic
tomography (TAT/PAT) for the physically relevant case of piecewise constant
sound speeds. We significantly relax the stringent conditions previously
required for resolving this problem, extending results to general classes of
piecewise constant sound speeds over inclusions with unknown locations. The
approach combines frequency-domain solution representations with distinctive
properties of elliptic and hyperbolic equations.

*Chengchun Hao,Tao Luo,Siqi Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper classifies finite-time blow-up scenarios for 3D incompressible Euler equations with surface tension in bounded domains, without symmetry or topology assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and categorize the possible blow-up behaviors of strong solutions in complex fluid dynamics settings.

Method: Analyzes the Euler equations with surface tension in bounded domains, focusing on the maximal existence time and regularity conditions.

Result: Identifies five exclusive blow-up scenarios, including boundary self-intersection, loss of curvature regularity, and velocity gradient blow-up.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive classification of blow-up scenarios, with simplified criteria for simply connected domains and irrotational flows.

Abstract: We establish the first complete classification of finite-time blow-up
scenarios for strong solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Euler
equations with surface tension in a bounded domain possessing a closed, moving
free boundary. Uniquely, we make \textit{no} assumptions on symmetry,
periodicity, graph representation, or domain topology (simple connectivity). At
the maximal existence time $T<\infty$, up to which the velocity field and the
free boundary can be continued in $H^3\times H^4$, blow-up must occur in at
least one of five mutually exclusive ways: (i) self-intersection of the free
boundary for the first time; (ii) loss of mean curvature regularity in
$H^{\frac{3}{2}}$, or the free boundary regularity in $H^{2+\varepsilon}$ (for
any sufficiently small constant $\varepsilon>0$); (iii) loss of
$H^{\frac{5}{2}}$ regularity for the normal boundary velocity; (iv) the
$L^1_tL^\infty$-blow-up of the tangential velocity gradient on the boundary; or
(v) the $L^1_tL^\infty$-blow-up of the full velocity gradient in the interior.
Furthermore, for simply connected domains, blow-up scenario (v) simplifies to a
vorticity-based Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, and in particular, irrotational
flows admit blow-up only at the free boundary.

Motivation: To understand the existence of solutions in mean field games systems and analyze their behavior under parameter variation.

Result: Existence of solutions is established, and the selection problem for the limit is investigated.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the behavior of mean field games systems under parameter changes and their limiting solutions.

Abstract: First, we study the existence of solutions for a class of first order mean

where the system comprises a stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the contact

  Then, for any fixed $\lambda>0$, let $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ be a solution of
the system \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &H(x,\lambda

critical value of the Hamiltonian $H(x,0,p)-F(x,m^\lambda(t))$. We investigate
the selection problem for the limit of $(u^\lambda,m^\lambda)$ as $\lambda$
tends to 0.

Motivation: To simplify and generalize the understanding of Reshetnyak-class homeomorphisms and their induced composition operators, particularly in Carnot groups and Sobolev spaces.

Method: The authors use bounded composition operators to describe homeomorphisms, focusing on their action on Lipschitz and Sobolev spaces, and provide a streamlined proof.

Result: An equivalent description of Reshetnyak-class homeomorphisms is established, and homeomorphisms inducing bounded operators between Sobolev spaces are characterized. The new proof is concise and reveals additional properties.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies existing results, reduces the need for complex tools, and uncovers new properties of the studied homeomorphisms, enhancing their theoretical understanding.

Abstract: For the Reshetnyak-class homeomorphisms $\varphi:\Omega\to Y$, where~$\Omega$
is a~domain in some Carnot group and~$Y$ is a~metric space, we obtain
an~equivalent description as the mappings which induce the bounded composition
operator $$ \varphi^*:{\rm Lip}(Y)\to L_q^1(\Omega), $$ where $1\leq q\leq
\infty$, as $\varphi^*u=u\circ\varphi$ for $u\in{\rm Lip}(Y)$. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach by characterizing the homeomorphisms
$\varphi:\Omega\to\Omega'$ of domains in some Carnot group~$\mathbb G$ which
induce the bounded composition operator $$ \varphi^*: L^1_p(\Omega')\cap {\rm
Lip}_{{\rm loc}}(\Omega')\to L^1_q (\Omega),\quad 1\leq q \leq p\leq \infty, $$

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the regularity and stability of free boundaries in the Alt-Phillips problem, particularly for negative exponents, to unify proofs and explore stability conditions.

Method: The authors reduce the problem to degenerate quasilinear PDEs, applying Schauder estimates for smoothness. They also exploit higher regularity to derive stability conditions and variational criteria.

Result: They prove smoothness of free boundaries and rule out nontrivial axially symmetric stable cones in low dimensions. A variational criterion for stability is also provided.

Conclusion: The paper unifies proofs for smoothness and introduces new stability insights, bridging the gap to minimal surfaces as the exponent approaches -2.

Abstract: We study the one-phase Alt-Phillips free boundary problem, focusing on the
case of negative exponents $\gamma \in (-2,0)$. The goal of this paper is
twofold.
  On the one hand, we prove smoothness of $C^{1,\alpha}$-regular free
boundaries by reducing the problem to a class of degenerate quasilinear PDEs,
for which we establish Schauder estimates. Such method provide a unified proof
of the smoothness for general exponents.
  On the other hand, by exploiting the higher regularity of solutions, we
derive a new stability condition for the Alt-Phillips problem in the negative
exponent regime, ruling out the existence of nontrivial axially symmetric
stable cones in low dimensions. Finally, we provide a variational criterion for
the stability of cones in the Alt-Phillips problem, which recovers the one for
minimal surfaces in the singular limit as $\gamma \to -2$.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves modulational instability in a 2D inviscid fluid with variable density under gravity, showing eigenvalue bifurcation for small-amplitude waves, justifying Parametric Subharmonic Instability (PSI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously justify PSI in inviscid internal waves, relevant in oceanography where viscosity is negligible.

Method: Uses Floquet-Bloch decomposition and Kato's similarity transformations to analyze perturbed eigenvalues without requiring operator boundedness.

Result: Demonstrates eigenvalue bifurcation, confirming PSI in inviscid settings.

Conclusion: Provides the first rigorous proof of PSI in inviscid internal waves, advancing understanding of energy transfer in such systems.

Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid fluid with variable
density, subject to the action of gravity. Assuming a stable equilibrium
density profile, we adopt the so-called Boussinesq approximation, which
neglects density variations in all terms except those involving gravity. This
model is widely used in the physical literature to describe internal gravity
waves.
  In this work, we prove a modulational instability result for such a system:
specifically, we show that the linearization around a small-amplitude
travelling wave admits at least one eigenvalue with positive real part,
bifurcating from double eigenvalues of the linear, unperturbed equations. This
can be regarded as the first rigorous justification of the Parametric
Subharmonic Instability (PSI) of inviscid internal waves, wherein energy is
transferred from an initially excited primary wave to two secondary waves with
different frequencies. Our approach uses Floquet-Bloch decomposition and Kato's
similarity transformations to compute rigorously the perturbed eigenvalues
without requiring boundedness of the perturbed operator - differing
fundamentally from prior analyses involving viscosity.
  Notably, the inviscid setting is especially relevant in oceanographic

Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs).

Method: Introduces just-in-time (JIT) compilation for integral kernels, with a novel algorithm for high angular momentum orbitals. Implemented in CUDA with single-precision support.

Result: 2x speedup for small basis sets (6-31G*), 4x for large sets (def2-TZVPP), and 3x speedup with single-precision.

Conclusion: JIT-based methods significantly improve computational efficiency for GTOs, with compact and high-performance CUDA implementation.

Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A novel algorithm combining the Hermite spectral method and a multi-scale evolution model is developed for solving force-driven multi-scale gaseous flows, improving computational efficiency by up to 50 times while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The multi-scale nature of force-driven gaseous flows, spanning continuum and rarefied regimes, presents a long-standing challenge for accurate and efficient numerical solutions.

Method: The solution algorithm integrates the Hermite spectral method for non-equilibrium particle distributions with a multi-scale evolution model from the unified gas-kinetic scheme, using adapted Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights.

Result: The method significantly enhances computational efficiency (up to 50 times) without sacrificing accuracy, preserving key gas-dynamic features like the well-balanced property. Numerical tests confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology offers a robust solution for force-driven multi-scale flows, with potential applications in various engineering challenges.

Abstract: Gaseous flows under an external force are intrinsically defined by their
multi-scale nature due to the large variation of densities along the forcing
direction. Devising a numerical method capable of accurately and efficiently
solving force-driven cross-scale flow dynamics, encompassing both continuum and
rarefied regimes, continues to pose a formidable and enduring challenge. In
this work, a novel solution algorithm for multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow
transport under an external force is developed based on the Boltzmann-BGK
equation. The core innovation lies in the fusion of the Hermite spectral method
(employed to characterize non-equilibrium particle distributions) with a
multi-scale evolution model (sourced from the unified gas-kinetic scheme),
achieving a seamless connection between computational methods and physical
models. To accommodate the properties of the spectral-collocation method, a
series of collocation points and weights are adapted based on the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature. As a result, the computational efficiency of the solution algorithm
is significantly improved (up to 50 times) while maintaining comparable
accuracy as the classical discrete velocity method. It is demonstrated that the
solution algorithm effectively preserves the key structural features of
gas-dynamic systems subjected to an external force, e.g., the well-balanced
property. Extensive numerical experiments have been performed to verify the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, including the one-dimensional
hydrostatic equilibrium problem, the Sod shock tube, the Fourier flow, the
Poiseuille flow, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem. The proposed
methodology can provide substantive theoretical insights into a wide range of
engineering challenges involving force-driven multi-scale flows.

*Bradley R. Andrew,Luca Guazzotto,Lorin S. Matthews,Truell W. Hyde,Evdokiya G. Kostadinova*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity using PK-4 facility data, converting statistical parameters into a Hamiltonian spectral model to analyze transport probabilities and generalize the approach to other complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand anomalous dust diffusion caused by plasma-mediated interactions in microgravity and develop a spectral model for transport analysis.

Method: Uses PK-4 experimental data to extract statistical parameters, then applies scaling relations to inform a Hamiltonian spectral model (kinetic and potential energy terms) to study energy states and transport probabilities.

Result: The model shows high transport probability at scales matching observed dust particle jumps, linking nonlocality and stochasticity to transport behavior.

Conclusion: The spectral approach is generalizable to other complex systems, like electron transport in 2D materials, where statistical models are impractical.

Abstract: Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is
investigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility
on board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video
cameras to track individual dust particles, which allows for the collection of
large amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and
velocities. In Part One of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify
anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated
dust-dust interactions in PK-4. Here we use scaling relations to convert
statistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a
Hamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian
(modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement
distribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling
stochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The
spectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability
for extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral
model shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high
probability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide
with the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the
experiments. Lastly, we discuss how this spectral approach is generalizable to
many complex systems, such as electron transport in 2D materials where
statistical models are not feasible.

Motivation: To understand the dynamics and excitation of high-frequency electrostatic drift waves in inhomogeneous magnetized plasmas, relevant to laboratory and astrophysical systems.

Method: Derived a second-order nonlinear equation and cubic dispersion relation with complex coefficients using fluid model equations, analyzing roots in parameter space.

Result: Coupled drift and ion cyclotron waves become unstable due to density gradients, while uncoupled drift waves are stable without collisions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the role of density gradients in wave excitation, with implications for tokamaks and solar corona plasmas.

Abstract: A second order nonlinear equation with variable coefficients has been derived
to govern the dynamics of high frequency electrostatic drift waves in an
inhomogeneous magnetized plasma in a moving frame of (2 + 1) spatio-temporal
dimensions. A cubic dispersion relation having complex coefficients has been
derived using the fluid model equations which explains the excitation of the
high frequency electrostatic drift waves in addition to coupled ion cyclotron
and drift waves. This has been studied in detail using the three exact roots of
the cubic dispersion relation in the parameter space implying that the coupled
high frequency electrostatic drift and ion cyclotron wave becomes unstable
solely due to density gradient whereas the uncoupled high frequency
electrostatic drift waves are stable in absence of collisional effects. The
possibilities of excitation of the uncoupled high frequency electrostatic drift
waves have been explored in context of certain laboratory and astrophysical
plasma systems including tokamaks and solar corona where existence of steeper
density gradients is more probable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise control of particle and energy sources is needed to achieve target core densities and temperatures in tokamaks.

Method: Uses Neural ODEs within the NeuralPlasmaODE framework to model plasma dynamics, compute external source profiles, and solve the control task as an optimization problem.

Result: The framework transforms forward simulation into control-oriented modeling, enabling practical computation of external source profiles.

Conclusion: The approach provides a method for controlling plasma behavior in current and future fusion devices.

Abstract: Achieving controlled burning plasma in tokamaks requires precise regulation
of external particle and energy sources to reach and maintain target core
densities and temperatures. This work presents an inverse modeling approach
using a multinodal plasma dynamics model based on neural ordinary differential
equations (Neural ODEs). Given a desired time evolution of nodal quantities
such as deuteron density or electron temperature, we compute the external
source profiles, such as neutral beam injection (NBI) power, that drive the
plasma toward the specified behavior. The approach is implemented within the
NeuralPlasmaODE framework, which models multi-region, multi-timescale transport
and incorporates physical mechanisms including radiation, auxiliary heating,
and internodal energy exchange. By formulating the control task as an
optimization problem, we use automatic differentiation through the Neural ODE
solver to minimize the discrepancy between simulated and target trajectories.
This framework transforms the forward simulation tool into a control-oriented
model and provides a practical method for computing external source profiles in
both current and future fusion devices.

Abstract: Understanding how key physical parameters influence burning plasma behavior
is critical for the reliable operation of ITER. In this work, we extend
NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region, multi-timescale model based on neural ordinary

radiation mechanisms in ITER plasmas. Normalized sensitivities of core and edge
temperatures and densities are computed with respect to transport
diffusivities, electron cyclotron radiation (ECR) parameters, impurity

perturbations around a trained nominal model for the ITER inductive scenario.
Results highlight the dominant influence of magnetic field strength, safety

Motivation: To enhance pre-ionization efficiency in magnetized, low-temperature fusion plasmas by understanding nonlinear electron-ECR heating interactions.

Method: 2D simulations analyzing ECR absorption parameters (phase angle, temperature, magnetic field gradients, beam width, frequency) and electron energy gain via nonlinear trapping.

Result: Electrons achieve up to 1 keV energy under optimal conditions; narrow beams outperform broad ones. Lower-frequency ECR systems (e.g., TCV) yield higher energy gains (800 eV) than higher-frequency ones (ASDEX-Upgrade, ITER).

Conclusion: Findings improve ECR heating strategies, aiding design optimization for plasma breakdown and startup in future fusion devices.

Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear interactions between electrons and
electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating beams in magnetized, low-temperature
fusion plasmas, focusing on enhancing pre-ionization efficiency. We analyse key
parameters affecting ECR absorption, including phase angle, temperature
inhomogeneity, magnetic field gradients, and beam characteristics like width
and frequency. Using 2D simulations for these low temperature plasmas, we
demonstrate electrons gain energy through nonlinear trapping in velocity space
near the resonance layer, achieving energy levels up to 1 keV under optimal
conditions. Notably, narrow beam widths allow electrons to reach higher energy
levels more efficiently than broader beams, highlighting the spatial
localization of the nonlinear interactions to regions where the field is strong
and frequency mismatch is small. Our findings show that in devices with
lower-frequency ECR systems, such as TCV (82.7 GHz), electrons can gain up to
800 eV, while higher-frequency devices, like ASDEX-Upgrade (140 GHz) and ITER
(170 GHz), achieve lower energy gains (480 eV and 420 eV, respectively) under
similar conditions. These insights are directly applicable to improving ECR
heating strategies, informing design choices in future fusion devices to

TL;DR: GeoWarp is an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics using GPU parallelism and automatic differentiation to compute Jacobians, enhancing efficiency with sparse Jacobian construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit MPM is unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term geomechanical processes, while implicit MPM faces challenges in Jacobian computation for complex models.

Method: Developed GeoWarp, leveraging GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic differentiation, with a sparse Jacobian algorithm for localized particle-grid interactions.

Result: Verified through elastoplasticity and poromechanics examples, showing robustness, scalability, and extensibility.

Conclusion: GeoWarp offers a robust and scalable platform for differentiable implicit MPM in geomechanics.

Abstract: The material point method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian particle
method, is increasingly used to simulate large-deformation and
history-dependent behavior of geomaterials. While explicit time integration
dominates current MPM implementations due to its algorithmic simplicity, such
schemes are unsuitable for quasi-static and long-term processes typical in
geomechanics. Implicit MPM formulations are free of these limitations but
remain less adopted, largely due to the difficulty of computing the Jacobian
matrix required for Newton-type solvers, especially when consistent tangent
operators should be derived for complex constitutive models. In this paper, we
introduce GeoWarp -- an implicit MPM framework for geomechanics built on NVIDIA
Warp -- that exploits GPU parallelism and reverse-mode automatic
differentiation to compute Jacobians without manual derivation. To enhance
efficiency, we develop a sparse Jacobian construction algorithm that leverages
the localized particle-grid interactions intrinsic to MPM. The framework is
verified through forward and inverse examples in large-deformation
elastoplasticity and coupled poromechanics. Results demonstrate that GeoWarp
provides a robust, scalable, and extensible platform for differentiable
implicit MPM simulation in computational geomechanics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DLPNO-MP2 with BvK boundary conditions for periodic systems, extending molecular DLPNO-MP2 to periodic cases, ensuring numerical stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the molecular DLPNO-MP2 method to periodic systems using BvK boundary conditions, ensuring accuracy and numerical stability.

Method: Uses localized Wannier functions in an LCAO formalism, forming PNOs via a PAO-OSV-PNO cascade, with charge-less and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting.

Result: DLPNO approximations are consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 and an alternative periodic method, showing smooth convergence to canonical correlation energy.

Conclusion: The BvK-DLPNO-MP2 method is validated for periodic systems, providing accurate reference MP2 correlation energies for 2D and 3D systems.

Abstract: We present domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset second
order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary
(BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in
a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole
program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO
cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as
intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless
and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be
numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the
periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful
benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2
methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations,
and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper

Method: Uses localized Wannier functions and translational symmetry for Hamiltonian integrals and wavefunction parameters, embedded in a megacell.

Result: The method shows sub-linear scaling with supercell size and is validated for systems up to 15000 basis functions.

Conclusion: Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 is accurate, efficient, and scalable for periodic systems, consistent with molecular calculations.

Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset
second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working
within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach,
Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell
and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals.
Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead
imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and
wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through
comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs
Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this
series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches
and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The
Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell
size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to

TL;DR: The paper analyzes automatic differentiation (AD) in astrophysics, identifying unexplored domains for gradient-based optimization and proposing GRASP, a unified framework for differentiable astrophysical computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of gradient-based optimization in astrophysics, leveraging AD for computational advantages in domains where it remains unused despite favorable conditions.

Method: Extends the discovery-oriented approach from GRAF to astrophysics, identifies nine unexplored domains, and presents mathematical foundations for AD implementation. Introduces GRASP as a unified framework.

Result: Identifies opportunities for AD in astrophysics, such as solving Einstein field equations and exploring stellar astrophysics, and proposes GRASP for systematic exploration.

Conclusion: This work systematically maps AD applications in astrophysics and introduces GRASP, a framework to guide future implementations in unexplored domains.

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD)
applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based
optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on
our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which
discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by
exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this
discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has
been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave
parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine
astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration
methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These
opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field
equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring
parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the
mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP
(Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems & Phenomena), a unified
framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms
traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution
spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate
unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and
to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their
implementation.

### [71] [Simulating Three-dimensional Turbulence with Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08972)
*Sifan Wang,Shyam Sankaran,Panos Stinis,Paris Perdikaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs simulate turbulent flows without grids or data, using adaptive architectures and advanced optimization to learn chaotic dynamics accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional turbulent flow simulations are computationally expensive; PINNs offer a mesh-free, data-free alternative.

Method: Uses physics-informed neural networks with adaptive architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization to solve fluid equations.

Result: Accurately reproduces key turbulence statistics like energy spectra and Reynolds stresses.

Conclusion: PINNs enable continuous turbulence modeling, overcoming traditional computational limits.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

### [72] [Discrete Differential Principle for Continuous Smooth Function Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09480)
*Guoyou Wang,Yihua Tan,Shiqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new discrete differential operator using Vandermonde matrices to mitigate dimensionality and error issues in Taylor's formula, achieving high-order accuracy and tighter error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the curse of dimensionality and error propagation in Taylor's formula for derivative computation and function representation.

Method: Uses a Vandermonde coefficient matrix from truncated Taylor series to compute derivatives and represent functions locally, with equidistant uniform sampling.

Result: Demonstrates high-order accuracy, tighter error bounds, and outperforms finite forward difference, cubic spline, and linear interpolation methods.

Conclusion: The method is effective for derivative estimation and function representation, with broad applications in vision, fluid mechanics, and more.

Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation,
such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential
equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in
visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and
thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete
situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to
estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using
the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our
method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number
of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing
equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating
the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds
for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating
tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the
two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative
calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative
estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function
representation. Consequently, our technique offers broad applicability across
domains such as vision representation, feature extraction, fluid mechanics, and
cross-media imaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how graph structure, including communities and degree distributions, impacts neural network performance in image classification, finding that densely interconnected communities enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between graph structure (e.g., communities, degree distributions) and neural network performance, addressing gaps in prior studies that overlooked mesoscale structures.

Method: Uses model networks (random, scale-free) and a biological neural network for comparison, analyzing structural impacts on image classification tasks.

Result: Networks with coherent, densely interconnected communities show better learning performance. Biological comparisons highlight real-world relevance.

Conclusion: The study advances network science and machine learning, suggesting biologically inspired neural network designs.

Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as
reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant
attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship
between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive
performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks,
particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work
advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation,
incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous
degree distributions and community structures, which are typical
characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a
nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model
networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a
biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We
examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image
classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect
performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely
interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The
comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our
findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth
further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and
machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more
biologically informed neural networks.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Simulation shows magnetic reconnection in the corona drives oscillations and magnetoacoustic waves, contributing to coronal heating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the roles of magnetic reconnection and MHD waves in coronal heating by simulating their interaction.

Method: Simulated reconnection due to converging magnetic sources, analyzing current sheet oscillations and wave generation.

Result: Impulsive reconnection drives sausage-mode oscillations (~91s) and generates fast- and slow-mode magnetoacoustic waves.

Conclusion: Reconnection and MHD waves symbiotically contribute to coronal heating, with observed periodicities around 91s.

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both
playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in
the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic
sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and
undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of
oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky
surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate.
Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic
Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves.
Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while
slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the
current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet,
for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale
magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the
parameters of our experiment.

*Jiechen Huang,Wenjian Yu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MicroWalk algorithm improves FRW-based capacitance extraction accuracy for arbitrary dielectrics, offering 802× speedup while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FRW transition schemes struggle with non-stratified dielectrics in advanced technology profiles, compromising accuracy.

Method: Proposes MicroWalk, an unbiased FRW transition algorithm for arbitrary dielectrics, combining it with hybrid strategies for efficiency.

Result: Achieves significant accuracy improvement over existing FRW solvers with 802× faster performance.

Conclusion: MicroWalk enables accurate and efficient capacitance extraction for complex dielectrics, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: The accuracy of floating-random-walk (FRW) based capacitance extraction
stands only when the recursive FRW transitions are sampled unbiasedly according
to surrounding dielectrics. Advanced technology profiles, featuring complicated
non-stratified dielectrics, challenge the accuracy of existing FRW transition
schemes that approximate dielectrics with stratified or eight-octant patterns.
In this work, we propose an algorithm named MicroWalk, enabling accurate FRW
transitions for arbitrary dielectrics while keeping high efficiency. It is
provably unbiased and equivalent to using transition probabilities solved by
finite difference method, but at orders of magnitude lower cost (802$\times$
faster). An enhanced 3-D capacitance solver is developed with a hybrid strategy
for complicated dielectrics, combining MicroWalk with the special treatment for
the first transition cube and the analytical algorithm for stratified cubes.
Experiments on real-world structures show that our solver achieves a
significant accuracy advantage over existing FRW solvers, while preserving high
efficiency.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights and tools for analyzing curve averages and related operators in all dimensions.

Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages in all

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study shows high redundancy in electronic structure datasets, enabling significant dataset pruning without losing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that large datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure.

Method: Analyzed redundancy in datasets and tested pruning strategies (random, coverage-based, and importance-based) to reduce dataset size.

Result: Coverage-based pruning retains accuracy with 100-fold less data and reduces training time by threefold, while importance-based pruning fails at higher pruning factors.

Conclusion: Redundancy in electronic structure data allows for minimal, essential datasets, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models for electronic structure rely on large datasets
generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory simulations.
This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets
across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and
complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large,
exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic
structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce
dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art
coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model
generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by
threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods,
which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher
pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage.
This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure
data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset
representative of each material class.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The study explores spin-current generation in skyrmion-host materials under microwave resonance, revealing two distinct skyrmion phases (SkX type-I and II) influenced by magnetic anisotropy. Spin excitations and currents exhibit unique behaviors under polarized microwaves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in generating spin currents through resonant processes in skyrmion-host materials.

Method: Micromagnetic simulations were used to examine the effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves on spin dynamics.

Result: Two skyrmion phases (SkX type-I and II) were identified with distinct spin excitation characteristics. Spin currents showed exotic features under polarized microwaves, e.g., enhancement under left-handed polarization and quenching under right-handed polarization.

Conclusion: Magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves critically influence spin dynamics and current generation, offering insights for future research on spin-current manipulation.

Abstract: We have investigated the spin-current pumped by the skyrmion-host material
with the lack of inversion symmetry through the microwave resonance process.
The effects of magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves are examined by
micromagnetic simulations. Our results reveal two distinct skyrmion phases,
designated as SkX type-I and II, which emerge at low ($K_z<0.1$ meV) and high
($K_z>0.1$ meV) magnetic anisotropy constants, respectively, having different
characteristics of spin excitations. The SkX type-I exhibits spin dynamics
where the resonant frequency of the breathing mode is lying in between the
clockwise and counterclockwise gyration modes of Bloch-type skyrmion at a very
low anisotropy, and is crossing over the counterclockwise mode at $K_z \sim
0.04$ meV. Meanwhile, the SkX type-II exhibits distinct spin excitations in
which the clockwise mode is notably absent, while the counterclockwise modes
exist at both low and high resonant frequencies. This suggests that the
magnetic anisotropy plays an essential role in the spin dynamics. Furthermore,
the resulting spin excitations induce spin currents with exotic features under
the polarized microwaves. The spin currents induced, for instance, by low-lying
in-plane excitations are strongly enhanced under the left-handed circularly
polarized microwaves, but quenched by the right-handed circularly polarized
microwaves regardless of the sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
These results may pave the way for understanding the non-trivial interplay
between magnetic anisotropy and polarized microwaves in the generation of spin
currents by a resonant process.

*Yongpan Li,Cheng-Cheng Liu*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces quantum metric-based optical selection rules, complementing the traditional Berry curvature approach, and demonstrates their application in valley-contrasted optoelectronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current theories of optical selection rules in solids focus only on Berry curvature, neglecting the quantum metric's role. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors propose a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization and validate it using tight-binding and first-principles calculations in specific models.

Result: The theory is confirmed in altermagnet and Kane-Mele models, as well as monolayer V2SeSO, showing valley-contrasted optical selection rules.

Conclusion: This work establishes a quantum metric framework for advancing valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic technologies.

Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions,
playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing
optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary
(Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions,
the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only
Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules.
We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for
linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection
rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys.
Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two
models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet
$\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for
valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.

*Meng-Qi Cheng,Wei-Dong Luo,Hong Sun*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD method to study glassy carbon under extreme conditions, revealing its high plasticity and transformation into amorphous diamond.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AIMD fails to capture anisotropic stress effects in disordered materials like glassy carbon, which are crucial for understanding transformations under extreme conditions.

Method: An ML-augmented constrained AIMD approach is developed by modifying VASP 6.3.2 to simulate glassy carbon under anisotropic stresses.

Result: The method reproduces experimental features of glassy carbon, shows high plasticity, and predicts transformation into amorphous diamond under specific pressure-temperature conditions.

Conclusion: The ML-augmented CAIMD framework is effective for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic
simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of
disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress
effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into
amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an
on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD)
approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major
experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions
and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high
plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains.
Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of
quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend
reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic
compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress
differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa.
Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80
percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3
content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest
pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a
general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered
materials under anisotropic stresses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order are understudied but crucial for understanding thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials at high temperatures.

Method: A theoretical formalism using Green's function techniques and diagrammatic formalism is developed for first-principles calculations of five- and six-phonon scatterings.

Result: Five- and six-phonon processes are negligible in Si but significant in MgO and dominant in BaO near melting, reducing thermal conductivity. BaO's scattering rates are much stronger than MgO's due to softened harmonic interactions.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials at high temperatures.

Abstract: Higher-order phonon scatterings beyond fourth order remain largely unexplored
despite their potential importance in strongly anharmonic materials at elevated
temperatures. We develop a theoretical formalism for first-principles
calculation of five- and six-phonon scatterings using Green's function
techniques based on a diagrammatic formalism, and systematically investigate
multi-phonon interactions in Si, MgO, and BaO from room temperature to near
melting points. Our calculation reveals dramatically different
material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain
negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO
near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering
intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate
that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by
interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon
scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite
identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from
softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation
for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic
materials and at elevated temperatures.

Conclusion: GATE 10 enhances research and innovation in medical physics by providing a robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich simulation platform.

Abstract: Over the past years, we have developed GATE version 10, a major
re-implementation of the long-standing Geant4-based Monte Carlo application for
particle and radiation transport simulation in medical physics. This release
introduces many new features and significant improvements, most notably a
Python-based user interface replacing the legacy static input files. The new
functionality of GATE version 10 is described in the part 1 companion paper.
The development brought significant challenges. In this paper, we present the
solutions that we have developed to overcome these challenges. In particular,
we present a modular design that robustly manages the core components of a
simulation: particle sources, geometry, physics processes, and data
acquisition. The architecture consists of parts written in C++ and Python,
which needed to be coupled. We explain how this framework allows for the
precise, time-aware generation of primary particles, a critical requirement for
accurately modeling positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide therapies,
and prompt-gamma timing systems. We present how GATE 10 handles complex Geant4
physics settings while exposing a simple interface to the user. Furthermore, we
describe the technical solutions that facilitate the seamless integration of
advanced physics models and variance reduction techniques. The architecture
supports sophisticated scoring of physical quantities (such as Linear Energy
Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness) and is designed for
multithreaded execution. The new user interface allows researchers to script
complex simulation workflows and directly couple external tools, such as
artificial intelligence models for source generation or detector response. By
detailing these architectural innovations, we demonstrate how GATE 10 provides
a more powerful and flexible tool for research and innovation in medical

Method: Uses two identical spacecraft in uniquely phased configurations for multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause.

Result: Will reveal how local mass density affects global reconnection, mesoscale structures drive dynamics, and magnetopause behavior with radiation belt electrons.

Conclusion: CRIMP provides crucial insights into spatial and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer at the magnetopause, aiding understanding of solar wind energy input.

Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP)
mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of
Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and
particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft.
CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside
magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized
plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the
dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased
spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements
at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial
differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii
(Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density
enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive
magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing
boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the
spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer
processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar
wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and
across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA
Heliophysics Mission Design School.

### [86] [Dunkl paraproducts and fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10042)
*The Anh Bui,Suman Mukherjee*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: The paper establishes fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian using a paraproduct decomposition adapted to the Dunkl setting, along with new auxiliary results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical fractional Leibniz rules to the Dunkl Laplacian framework, addressing gaps in the literature.

Method: Adapts the classical paraproduct decomposition to the Dunkl setting, proving pointwise decay estimates, almost orthogonality, and boundedness of Dunkl paraproduct operators.

Result: Derives fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian, supported by new auxiliary results.

Conclusion: The adapted paraproduct method successfully extends classical results to the Dunkl Laplacian, providing foundational tools for further analysis.

Abstract: We establish fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ of
the form $$\|(-\Delta_k)^s(fg)\|_{L^p(d\mu_k)} \lesssim \|(-\Delta_k)^s
f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)} + \|f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)}
\|(-\Delta_k)^s g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)}.$$ Our approach relies on adapting the
classical paraproduct decomposition to the Dunkl setting. In the process, we
develop several new auxiliary results. Specifically, we show that for a
Schwartz function $f$, the function $(-\Delta_k)^s f$ satisfies a pointwise
decay estimate; we establish a version of almost orthogonality estimates
adapted to the Dunkl framework; and we investigate the boundedness of Dunkl
paraproduct operators on the Lebesgue spaces.

### [87] [Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937)
*Zhou-Quan Wan,Shiwei Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper addresses the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, introducing a tail-aware error estimation method and an exact bridge link method to eliminate the issue for certain observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The infinite variance problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations affects reliability across condensed matter, nuclear, and high-energy physics.

Method: The authors propose a tail-aware error estimation method and an exact bridge link method, modifying the standard DQMC algorithm without systematic bias.

Result: The methods correct unreliable confidence intervals and eliminate infinite variance for specific observables, enhancing simulation reliability.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution to the infinite variance problem, improving the robustness of fermion simulations.

Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo
simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter
to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly
refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many
situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory,
and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the
algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises
as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To
remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation
method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the
infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an
exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to
the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is
straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results
establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem,
with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of
fundamental fermion simulations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a space-discrete approximation of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion system with stochastic boundary conditions, proving convergence to the continuum solution using a splitting strategy and compact embedding theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of approximating highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems with stochastic boundary conditions, ensuring convergence to the continuum solution.

Method: A splitting strategy decomposes the system into a space-discrete heat equation with stochastic boundary conditions and a nonlinear nonlocal system. Convergence is proven using a priori estimates and compact embedding theorems.

Result: Convergence of the discrete scheme to the continuum solution is established, and a fully discrete approximation is also discussed.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully approximates the nonlinear system with stochastic boundary conditions, with proven convergence.

Abstract: A space discrete approximation to a highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion
system endowed with a stochastic dynamical boundary condition is analyzed and
the convergence of the discrete scheme to the solution to the corresponding
continuum random system is established. A splitting strategy allows us to
decompose the random system into a space-discrete heat equation with a
stochastic boundary condition, and a nonlinear and nonlocal space-discrete
differential system coupled with the first one and with deterministic initial
and boundary conditions. The convergence result is obtained by first
establishing some a priori estimates for both space-discrete splitted variables
and then exploiting compact embedding theorems for time-space Besov spaces on
the positive lattice. The convergence of a fully discrete approximation of the
random system is also discussed.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Finite-time blow-up results for 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations with dissipation, Caputo time-memory, and superlinear noise are proven, showing vorticity explosion due to vortex-stretching-driven renewal inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which vorticity in stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations explodes in finite time, particularly focusing on the interplay between temporal memory and stochastic noise.

Method: Analyzed generalized 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations with dissipation, Caputo time-memory, and superlinear noise, identifying a critical window of memory leading to vorticity explosion.

Result: For a critical memory range, the second moment of vorticity supremum explodes due to vortex-stretching-driven renewal inequality, demonstrating finite-time blow-up.

Conclusion: Short enough temporal memory permits instability, while long enough memory allows it to mature, coupling with stochastic noise to guarantee vorticity explosion in finite time.

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time blow-up results for generalized 3D
stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations \[ \Caputo \mathbf{u} =
-(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} - \nabla p + \nu \fLaplacian \mathbf{u} +
I^{1-\beta}[\sigma(\mathbf{u}) \dot{W}], \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0, \]
with dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$ for $\alpha \in (1, 3/2)$, Caputo
time-memory $\partial_t^\beta$, and superlinear noise
$|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$, proving that for a critical window of memory, $\beta
\in (\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+3}, \beta_c(\alpha,\gamma))$, the second moment of
the vorticity supremum explodes due to a vortex-stretching-driven renewal
inequality. This work reveals that when a fluid's temporal memory, governed by
$\partial_t^\beta$, is short enough to permit instability but long enough for
that instability to mature, the relentless self-amplification from vortex
stretching, when coupled with explosive stochastic kicks from the
$|\mathbf{u}|^{1+\gamma}$ noise, guarantees the vorticity will spin up to
infinity in finite time.

TL;DR: WellPINN is a workflow using sequentially trained PINNs to accurately model wells in reservoir simulations, improving fluid pressure inference near wells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINN-based methods struggle with accurate fluid pressure representation near wells, especially early in injection.

Method: WellPINN decomposes the domain into shrinking subdomains, iteratively approximating well radius to match actual dimensions.

Result: The workflow successfully infers fluid pressure from pumping rates throughout injection, enhancing PINN potential for inverse modeling.

Conclusion: WellPINN advances reservoir modeling by addressing well representation challenges, with open data and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate representation of wells is essential for reliable reservoir
characterization and simulation of operational scenarios in subsurface flow
models. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a
promising method for reservoir modeling, offering seamless integration of
monitoring data and governing physical equations. However, existing PINN-based
studies face major challenges in capturing fluid pressure near wells,
particularly during the early stage after injection begins. To address this, we
propose WellPINN, a modeling workflow that combines the outputs of multiple
sequentially trained PINN models to accurately represent wells. This workflow
iteratively approximates the radius of the equivalent well to match the actual
well dimensions by decomposing the domain into stepwise shrinking subdomains
with a simultaneously reducing equivalent well radius. Our results demonstrate
that sequential training of superimposing networks around the pumping well is
the first workflow that focuses on accurate inference of fluid pressure from
pumping rates throughout the entire injection period, significantly advancing
the potential of PINNs for inverse modeling and operational scenario
simulations. All data and code for this paper will be made openly available at

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses estimating a matrix encoding pairwise distances or network edge weights under the barycentric coding model using Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. It proposes two methods for this task and demonstrates their applications in machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the analysis problem corresponding to computing GW barycenters, assuming the target matrix belongs to a set of GW barycenters of known templates.

Method: Two methods are proposed: fixed-point iteration for GW barycenters and a differentiation-based approach using a blow-up technique.

Result: The paper demonstrates the application of the proposed GW analysis approach through numerical experiments and machine learning applications.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the problem of estimating matrices under the GW distance framework, with practical applications in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a matrix that encodes pairwise
distances in a finite metric space (or, more generally, the edge weight matrix
of a network) under the barycentric coding model (BCM) with respect to the
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance function. We frame this task as estimating the
unknown barycentric coordinates with respect to the GW distance, assuming that
the target matrix (or kernel) belongs to the set of GW barycenters of a finite
collection of known templates. In the language of harmonic analysis, if
computing GW barycenters can be viewed as a synthesis problem, this paper aims
to solve the corresponding analysis problem. We propose two methods: one
utilizing fixed-point iteration for computing GW barycenters, and another
employing a differentiation-based approach to the GW structure using a blow-up
technique. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed GW analysis
approach in a series of numerical experiments and applications to machine
learning.

### [94] [On the Convergence of the Policy Iteration for Infinite-Horizon Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09994)

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes challenges in Policy Iteration (PI) for nonlinear optimal-control problems, focusing on GHJB equation solutions and domain invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical gaps in PI's application to infinite-horizon, nonlinear, autonomous optimal-control problems, particularly on bounded domains.

Method: Investigates GHJB equation solutions, introduces a procedure for domain invariance, and establishes regularity conditions.

Result: Numerical results support the theoretical findings, ensuring well-posed PI iterations.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for viable PI in constrained settings, emphasizing GHJB regularity and domain invariance.

Abstract: Policy iteration (PI) is a widely used algorithm for synthesizing optimal
feedback control policies across many engineering and scientific applications.
When PI is deployed on infinite-horizon, nonlinear, autonomous optimal-control
problems, however, a number of significant theoretical challenges emerge -
particularly when the computational state space is restricted to a bounded
domain. In this paper, we investigate these challenges and show that the
viability of PI in this setting hinges on the existence, uniqueness, and
regularity of solutions to the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB)
equation solved at each iteration. To ensure a well-posed iterative scheme, the
GHJB solution must possess sufficient smoothness, and the domain on which the
GHJB equation is solved must remain forward-invariant under the closed-loop
dynamics induced by the current policy. Although fundamental to the method's
convergence, previous studies have largely overlooked these aspects. This paper
closes that gap by introducing a constructive procedure that guarantees forward
invariance of the computational domain throughout the entire PI sequence and by
establishing sufficient conditions under which a suitably regular GHJB solution
exists at every iteration. Numerical results are presented for a grid-based
implementation of PI to support the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper studies a min-max problem for strictly concave conservation laws on a 1-1 network, focusing on inflow controls at the junction. It explores minimizing the total variation of flow solutions while maximizing the time integral of flux, with specific conditions for optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and optimize the behavior of flow solutions in networks with strictly concave conservation laws, particularly focusing on inflow controls at junctions.

Method: The method involves analyzing the total variation of boundary-flux solutions and establishing regularity results. It also examines entropy weak solutions for optimal inflow controls under monotone initial data.

Result: Key results include a regularity theorem for boundary-flux solutions and the identification of optimal inflow controls for monotone initial data. Non-monotone cases are shown to lack optimality.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that entropy weak solutions provide optimal inflow controls for monotone initial data but fail in non-monotone cases, demonstrated through prototype examples.

Abstract: We consider a min-max problem for strictly concave conservation laws on a 1-1
network, with inflow controls acting at the junction. We investigate the
minimization problem for a functional measuring the total variation of the flow
of the solutions at the node, among those solutions that maximize the time
integral of the flux. To formulate this problem we establish a regularity
result showing that the total variation of the boundary-flux of the solution of
an initial-boundary value problem is controlled by the total variation of the
initial datum and of the flux of the boundary datum. In the case the initial
datum is monotone, we show that the flux of the entropy weak solution at the
node provides an optimal inflow control for this min-max problem. We also
exhibit two prototype examples showing that, in the case where the initial
datum is not monotone, the flux of the entropy weak solution is no more
optimal.

Motivation: Model protein production dynamics in a single cell with feedback regulation, addressing the impact of time delay and nonlinear boundary conditions.

Method: Establish existence of solutions for parabolic PDEs with delayed nonlinear boundary conditions. Analyze stability and Hopf bifurcation conditions.

Result: Positive, bounded solution exists. Stability and Hopf bifurcation conditions depend on nonlinearity, boundary flux, and delay.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into protein dynamics with feedback, highlighting the role of delay and nonlinearity in stability and bifurcation.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of a positive, bounded solution for
a class of parabolic partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary

production dynamics of a protein species by a single cell, where a feedback
mechanism downregulates the protein's production. Furthermore, we analyze the
stability of a non-trivial steady-state solution and provide sufficient
conditions on the nonlinearity parameter, boundary flux, and time delay that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the global dynamics of semiflows in scalar semilinear parabolic equations with spatial shift symmetry, focusing on attractor structures and their classification.

Method: Analyzes the Sturm attractor decomposition and connection graphs under hyperbolicity assumptions, using lap signatures of period maps for integrable steady-state ODEs.

Result: Identifies 21 connection graphs with up to seven vertices and reconstructs the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor in a PDE context.

Conclusion: The Sturm attractor framework provides a systematic way to classify and understand the dynamics of such systems, with potential applications to other PDE settings.

Abstract: We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear
parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts
of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} +
f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$,
the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor
$\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm
attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$
\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$
where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct
elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating
waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen
waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent
$\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$,
with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$
and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the
directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For
illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$
with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps
associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
  As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas
tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating Kitaev materials with complex secondary interactions and explore their quantum spin liquid behavior for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Method: Developed efficient quantum circuits for ground-state preparation, applied controlled perturbations, and measured time-dependent spin correlations on a trapped-ion quantum processor.

Result: Observed chiral edge dynamics in the non-Abelian phase, consistent with topological order, and studied the impact of Heisenberg interactions on edge dynamics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical approach to probe topological order in quantum spin liquids using quantum hardware, advancing quantum simulation of strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a
quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge
modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However,
real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary
interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand
novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report
quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion
quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that
are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for
ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure
time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian
phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number
-- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the
Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg
model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics,
while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological
protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical
signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable
quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly
correlated materials.

Motivation: To enable efficient simulation of strongly-coupled quantum plasmas, which are beyond classical computation capabilities, by leveraging quantum computing.

Method: Utilized high-fidelity device-native gates and a novel error mitigation technique to simulate laser pulse scattering in inhomogeneous plasmas via a local spin model.

Result: Successfully demonstrated linear plasma wave propagation, requiring fewer gates than other approaches, making it feasible on current quantum hardware.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum simulation of plasmas, enabling future study of nonlinear quantum dynamics in strongly-coupled plasmas.

Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of
strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in
regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large.
In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum
plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting
quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates,
combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of
laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the
identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma
waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other
proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum
computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that
cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear
quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.

TL;DR: The study investigates the impact of broadband electron energy distributions on Jupiter's ionospheric conductances, finding higher values compared to mono-energetic distributions, and suggests alternative mechanisms for auroral electron acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of electron precipitation in modifying Jupiter's ionospheric conductances and its implications for magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.

Method: Modeled broadband electron energy using a kappa distribution, computed ionospheric ion densities via electron transport, and integrated conductivities to derive Pedersen and Hall conductances.

Result: Broadband distributions yield higher conductances than mono-energetic ones; updated collision cross-sections and transport model outputs also significantly affect results.

Conclusion: Findings suggest either field-aligned current limitations or non-current-associated electron acceleration processes in Jupiter's auroral regions.

Abstract: The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in
understanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the
magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the
composition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these
conductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of
a broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed
electron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values
is investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous
studies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband
precipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution,
which is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the
density vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the
Pedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the
conductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally,
the Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the
corresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances
are globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution
rather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct
outputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression
presented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron
collision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance
values. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation
enforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the
field-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere
are also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned
currents.

### [102] [Electromagnetic Energy Extraction from Kerr Black Holes: Ab-Initio Calculations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08942)
*Claudio Meringolo,Filippo Camilloni,Luciano Rezzolla*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: General-relativistic simulations confirm the Blandford-Znajek mechanism's robustness in extracting energy from rotating black holes, aligning with analytic and magnetohydrodynamic results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the Blandford-Znajek mechanism's theoretical predictions and provide accurate estimates of electromagnetic luminosity from rotating black holes.

Method: Conducted general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres with a split-monopole magnetic field, varying black-hole spin.

Result: Simulations reproduced force-free electrodynamics, measured jet power, and matched analytic and magnetohydrodynamic results after rescaling.

Conclusion: The Blandford-Znajek mechanism is robust, and simulations provide reliable luminosity estimates for rotating black holes across mass scales.

Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic
astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations
of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin.
Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with
these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black
holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The
Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic
calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of
the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the
electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating
black holes across the mass scale.

### [103] [Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10341)
*Spandan Ghosh*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper addresses Joyce's conjecture on desingularizing Lagrangian intersections using JLT expanders, proving stronger convergence results for Lagrangian mean curvature flow (LMCF) via manifolds with corners and a-corners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from Joyce's question about desingularizing Lagrangian intersections and the prior affirmative answer by Begley and Moore, which lacked strong convergence results.

Method: The authors use a PDE-based approach, leveraging manifolds with corners and a-corners, inspired by Lira et al.'s work on network flow.

Result: They establish the existence of a solution with stronger convergence properties for LMCF compared to previous results.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of LMCF and desingularization, providing a more robust framework for future studies.

Abstract: In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can
desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using
JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the
desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by
constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit
along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed
Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution
with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with
corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E.
based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for
network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.
