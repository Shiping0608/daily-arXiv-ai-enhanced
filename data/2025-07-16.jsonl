In FWI,\napproximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for\nNewton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and\nimproving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We\nadapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread\nfunction method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building\non an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that\nunifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic\nquadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that\nthese high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational\ncosts in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a\nlow-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little\nmeaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and\nunderestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is\noverestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated\nusing the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical\ninformation about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior\nvariance."}

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated\nthrough results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport\nexamples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum\nrelative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to\nprevious surrogate model approaches."}

Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima\nconditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the\npartially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different\nexponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high\nfrequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time\nintegrability of Lipschitz bound.
