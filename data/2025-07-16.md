### [1] [Accelerating seismic inversion and uncertainty quantification with efficient high-rank Hessian approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10804)
*Mathew Hu,Nick Alger,Rami Nammour,Omar Ghattas*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for high-rank Hessian approximations to improve seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) and uncertainty quantification (UQ), unifying two existing approaches for better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Hessian computation is impractical for large-scale seismic problems due to high computational costs and the high-rank nature of the Hessian. Existing low-rank methods are inefficient.

Method: The paper adapts and unifies two high-rank Hessian approximation methods (point spread function and pseudo-differential operator probing) into a novel approach.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method reduces computational costs in FWI and improves MCMC efficiency in UQ, providing accurate posterior variance estimates.

Conclusion: High-rank Hessian approximations significantly enhance both FWI and UQ, outperforming low-rank methods and exact Hessian-free approaches.

Abstract: Efficient high-rank approximations of the Hessian can accelerate seismic full
waveform inversion (FWI) and uncertainty quantification (UQ). In FWI,
approximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for
Newton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and
improving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian
approximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
proposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the
efficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale
problems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,
and performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave
equations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank
methods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We
adapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread
function method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building
on an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that
unifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic
quadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that
these high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational
costs in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a
low-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little
meaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and
underestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is
overestimated, providing false confidence. In contrast, MCMC samples generated
using the high-rank Hessian approximations provide meaningful statistical
information about the posterior and more accurately assess the posterior
variance.

### [2] [Dimension of Bi-degree $(d,d)$ Spline Spaces with the Highest Order of Smoothness over Hierarchical T-Meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11047)
*Bingru Huang,Falai Chen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper derives a dimensional formula for bi-degree (d,d) spline spaces with high smoothness over hierarchical T-meshes, using recursive methods and conformality vector spaces. It also proposes mesh modification for stability and links the dimension to lower-degree spline spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and compute the dimension of spline spaces with high smoothness over hierarchical T-meshes, enabling better construction of basis functions.

Method: Uses the smoothing cofactor-conformality method, recursive calculations for conformality vector spaces, and mesh modification strategies.

Result: A dimensional formula for spline spaces is derived, and stability is ensured through mesh modification. The dimension is linked to lower-degree spline spaces.

Conclusion: The findings facilitate basis function construction for spline spaces over hierarchical T-meshes, advancing practical applications.

Abstract: In this article, we study the dimension of the spline space of di-degree
$(d,d)$ with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical T-mesh
$\mathscr T$ using the smoothing cofactor-conformality method. Firstly, we
obtain a dimensional formula for the conformality vector space over a tensor
product T-connected component. Then, we prove that the dimension of the
conformality vector space over a T-connected component of a hierarchical T-mesh
under the tensor product subdivision can be calculated in a recursive manner.
Combining these two aspects, we obtain a dimensional formula for the bi-degree
$(d,d)$ spline space with the highest order of smoothness over a hierarchical
T-mesh $\mathscr T$ with mild assumption. Additionally, we provide a strategy
to modify an arbitrary hierarchical T-mesh such that the dimension of the
bi-degree $(d,d)$ spline space is stable over the modified hierarchical T-mesh.
Finally, we prove that the dimension of the spline space over such a
hierarchical T-mesh is the same as that of a lower-degree spline space over its
CVR graph. Thus, the proposed solution can pave the way for the subsequent
construction of basis functions for spline space over such a hierarchical
T-mesh.

### [3] [Stability of the Active Flux Method in the Framework of Summation-by-Parts Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11068)
*Wasilij Barsukow,Christian Klingenberg,Lisa Lechner,Jan Nordström,Sigrun Ortleb,Hendrik Ranocha*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends the theoretical foundation of the Active Flux method by analyzing it using summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, demonstrating its energy stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical justification for the Active Flux method by leveraging SBP operators, commonly used in other numerical schemes.

Method: Analyzes the Active Flux method using degenerate SBP operators to formulate and prove its energy stability.

Result: The Active Flux method can be formulated with SBP operators, offering a novel proof of its energy stability.

Conclusion: The study successfully links the Active Flux method to SBP theory, enhancing its theoretical understanding and stability analysis.

Abstract: The Active Flux method is a numerical method for conservation laws using a
combination of cell averages and point values, based on ideas from finite
volumes and finite differences. This unusual mix has been shown to work well in
many situations. We expand the theoretical justifications of the Active Flux
method by analyzing it from the point of view of summation-by-parts (SBP)
operators, which are routinely used to analyze finite difference, finite
volume, and finite element schemes. We show that the Active Flux method can be
formulated using degenerate SBP operators, yielding a first and novel approach
for showing the energy stability of the Active Flux method.

### [4] [Adaptive Reduced Basis Trust Region Methods for Parabolic Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11130)
*Michael Kartmann,Benedikt Klein,Mario Ohlberger,Thomas Schuster,Stefan Volkwein*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reduced-order modeling approach to accelerate the computationally demanding iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) for parameter identification in parabolic PDEs, embedding it in an adaptive trust-region framework for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational demands of traditional regularization methods like IRGNM for PDE parameter identification motivate the need for efficient, reduced-order alternatives.

Method: The method uses adaptive reduced-order modeling for state and adjoint evaluations, combined with an error-aware trust-region framework to ensure accuracy.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate effectiveness for time-dependent and time-independent parameter identification in reaction-diffusion systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully balances computational efficiency and accuracy, with the implementation made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: We consider nonlinear inverse problems arising in the context of parameter
identification for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). For stable
reconstructions, regularization methods such as the iteratively regularized
Gauss-Newton method (IRGNM) are commonly used, but their application is
computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional nature of PDE
discretizations. To address this bottleneck, we propose a reduced-order
modeling approach that accelerates both the state and adjoint evaluations
required for derivative-based optimization. Our method builds on the recent
contribution [Kartmann et al. Adaptive reduced basis trust region methods for
parameter identification problems. Comput. Sci. Eng. 1, 3 (2024)] for elliptic
forward operators and constructs the reduced forward operator adaptively in an
online fashion, combining both parameter and state space reduction. To ensure
reliability, we embed the IRGNM iteration within an adaptive, error-aware
trust-region framework that certifies the accuracy of the reduced-order
approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
through numerical results for both time-dependent and time-independent
parameter identification problems in dynamic reaction-diffusion systems. The
implementation is made available for reproducibility and further use.

### [5] [Convergence of a finite-volume scheme for aggregation-diffusion equations with saturation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11132)
*David Gómez-Castro*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a finite-volume method for aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear mobility, proving convergence using an Aubin--Simons compactness theorem. Two convergence results are provided under varying conditions on entropies, mobility, and potentials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and rigorously analyze a finite-volume method for solving aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear mobility, ensuring convergence under different mathematical conditions.

Method: The authors employ an Aubin--Simons compactness theorem and use discrete $H^1$ and $W^{-1,1}$ norms to prove convergence. The method is tested under two sets of conditions: one for general entropies and another for specific entropies with free boundaries.

Result: Two convergence results are established: (1) for general entropies with Lipschitz mobility and smooth potentials, and (2) for strictly convex entropies with continuous mobility and less restrictive potentials.

Conclusion: The finite-volume method is proven effective for aggregation-diffusion equations under specified conditions, providing a robust framework for future applications.

Abstract: In [Bailo, Carrillo, Hu. SIAM J. Appl. Math. 2023] the authors introduce a
finite-volume method for aggregation-diffusion equations with non-linear
mobility. In this paper we prove convergence of this method using an
Aubin--Simons compactness theorem due to Gallou\"et and Latch\'e. We use
suitable discrete $H^1$ and $W^{-1,1}$ discrete norms. We provide two
convergence results. A first result shows convergence with general entropies
($U$) (including singular and degenerate) if the initial datum does not have
free boundaries, the mobility is Lipschitz, and the confinement ($V$) and
aggregation ($K$) potentials are $W^{2,\infty}_0$. A second result shows
convergence when the initial datum has free boundaries, mobility is just
continuous, and $V$ and $K$ are $W^{1,\infty}$, but under the assumption that
the entropy $U$ is $C^1$ and strictly convex.

### [6] [Adaptive FEM with explicit time integration for the wave equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11193)
*Marcus J. Grote,Omar Lakkis,Carina S. Santos*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A space-time adaptive strategy for the wave equation combines evolving meshes and local time-stepping to bypass CFL restrictions, using error indicators for accuracy control and mesh refinement/coarsening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overly stringent CFL stability restrictions due to local mesh refinement and ensure accurate solutions with adaptive meshes.

Method: Uses a posteriori error estimators, evolving meshes, local time-stepping (Leapfrog), and adaptive refinement/coarsening based on error indicators.

Result: Achieves optimal convergence rates for error estimators on time-evolving meshes.

Conclusion: The adaptive strategy efficiently integrates explicit time-stepping with mesh changes while maintaining accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Starting from a recent a posteriori error estimator for the finite element
solution of the wave equation with explicit time-stepping [Grote, Lakkis,
Santos, 2024], we devise a space-time adaptive strategy which includes both
time evolving meshes and local time-stepping [Diaz, Grote, 2009] to overcome
any overly stringent CFL stability restriction on the time-step due to local
mesh refinement. Moreover, at each time-step the adaptive algorithm monitors
the accuracy thanks to the error indicators and recomputes the current step on
a refined mesh until the desired tolerance is met; meanwhile, the mesh is
coarsened in regions of smaller errors. Leapfrog based local time-stepping is
applied in all regions of local mesh refinement to incorporate adaptivity into
fully explicit time integration with mesh change while retaining efficiency.
Numerical results illustrate the optimal rate of convergence of the a
posteriori error estimators on time evolving meshes.

### [7] [On maximal curves of $n$-correct sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11207)
*H. Hakopian,G. Vardanyan,N. Vardanyan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper studies maximal curves in n-correct sets of nodes in the plane, presenting new properties and extending known ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role and properties of maximal curves in interpolation theory, particularly for n-correct sets.

Method: Analyzes algebraic curves of degree ≤n in n-correct sets, focusing on maximal curves passing through a specific number of nodes.

Result: Derives the maximum number of nodes a curve of degree k can pass through and characterizes maximal curves.

Conclusion: Maximal curves are crucial for studying n-correct sets, with new and extended properties enhancing their theoretical framework.

Abstract: Suppose $\mathcal{X}$ is an $n$-correct set of nodes in the plane, that is,
it admits a unisolvent interpolation with bivariate polynomials of total degree
less than or equal to $n.$ Then an algebraic curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ can
pass through at most $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\Xset,$ where $d(n,k)={{n+2}\choose
{2}}-{{n+2-k}\choose {2}}.$ A curve $q$ of degree $k\le n$ is called maximal if
it passes through exactly $d(n,k)$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$ In particular, a
maximal line is a line passing through $d(n,1)=n+1$ nodes of $\mathcal{X}.$
Maximal curves are an important tool for the study of $n$-correct sets. We
present new properties of maximal curves, as well as extensions of known
properties.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the unique minimizer of the Faddeev-Skyrme energy in a specific homotopy class.

Method: Mathematical proof involving rigid motions and analysis of the Faddeev-Skyrme energy.

Result: The Hopf map is the sole minimizer under the given conditions.

Conclusion: The study confirms the uniqueness of the Hopf map as the energy minimizer for large coupling constants.

Abstract: We prove that, modulo rigid motions, the Hopf map is the unique minimizer of
the Faddeev--Skyrme energy in its homotopy class, for a sufficiently large
coupling constant.

### [9] [Absence of $L^p$ spectrum for asymptotically flat diffusions in region with cavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10728)
*Agnid Banerjee,Nicola Garofalo*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper extends Rellich's classical result to variable-coefficient elliptic equations, proving that solutions in $L^p$ for $0<p<\frac{2n}{n-1}$ must vanish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Rellich's $L^2$ result for the Laplacian to variable-coefficient elliptic equations and identify integrability thresholds.

Method: Uses weighted energies and geometry-adapted vector fields to derive monotonicity formulas.

Result: Solutions in $L^p(\Om)$ for $0<p<\frac{2n}{n-1}$ vanish, revealing a sharper threshold.

Conclusion: The study provides a refined integrability condition for solutions in variable-coefficient settings.

Abstract: We study solutions to variable-coefficient elliptic equations of the form
$-\D(A(x) \nabla u) = \kappa u$, $\kappa>0$, in an exterior domain $\Om\subset
\Rn$, where $A(x)$ is uniformly elliptic and asymptotically flat. Extending
Rellich's classical $L^2$ result for the Laplacian, we show that if $u\in
L^p(\Om)$ for some $0<p<\frac{2n}{n-1}$, then $u\equiv 0$. The proof uses new
monotonicity formulas based on weighted energies and vector fields adapted to
the geometry of $A(x)$. Our results highlight a sharper integrability threshold
in the variable-coefficient setting.

### [10] [Self-adjoint extensions for the Laplacian operator on non-compacts graphs and the existence and stability of standing waves for NLS models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10821)
*Jaime Angulo Pava,Alexander Munoz*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies unitary dynamics of the Schrödinger operator on looping-edge and T-shaped graphs, derives self-adjoint boundary conditions, and applies these to analyze traveling waves in a cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically describe unitary dynamics on specific graph structures and apply the findings to nonlinear Schrödinger equations with δ'-type interactions.

Method: Develops boundary conditions for self-adjointness of the Laplacian on looping-edge and T-shaped graphs, then analyzes traveling waves in a cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

Result: Novel boundary conditions ensure unitary dynamics; existence and orbital (in)stability of traveling waves are determined by parameters N and Z.

Conclusion: The approach provides a framework for studying dynamics on graphs and reveals stability conditions for nonlinear wave solutions.

Abstract: In this work we first study a systematic way to describe the unitary dynamics
of the Schr\"odinger operator on a looping-edge graphs $\mathcal{G}$ (a graph
consisting of a circle and a finite amount $N$ of infinite half-lines attached
to a common vertex). We also apply our approach on $\mathcal T$-shaped graphs
(metric graphs that consists of a pendant edge and a finite amount of
half-lines attached to the common vertex). In both cases we obtain novel
boundary conditions on the unique vertex that guarantee self-adjointness of the
Laplacian operator and therefore unitary dynamics for the linear Schr\"odinger
equation on both, looping-edge and $\mathcal{T}$-shaped graphs. In the second
part, as an application of our abstract results, we discuss the existence and
orbital (in)stability of some traveling waves for the cubic nonlinear
Schr\"odiner equation posed on $\mathcal{G}$ with interactions of
$\delta'$-type with strength $Z<0$ (continuity at the vertex is not required).
We propose a dnoidal-profile in the circle with soliton tail-profiles on the
half-lines and establish the existence and (in)stability depending on the
relative size $N$ and $Z$.

### [11] [First critical field in the pinned three dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10915)
*Matías Díaz-Vera,Carlos Román*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies extreme type-II superconductors using a 3D magnetic Ginzburg-Landau model with a pinning term. It provides a lower bound for the first critical field and characterizes the Meissner solution. The onset of vorticity is linked to a weighted isoflux problem, leveraging adapted tools from prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of extreme type-II superconductors, particularly the formation of vortex filaments and the critical field conditions, using a modified Ginzburg-Landau framework.

Method: Uses the 3D magnetic Ginzburg-Landau functional with a pinning term and adapts tools from prior work to analyze the critical field and Meissner solution.

Result: A lower bound for the first critical field is established, and the Meissner solution is characterized. The onset of vorticity is connected to a weighted isoflux problem.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of vortex formation in superconductors by linking it to a weighted isoflux problem and providing critical field insights.

Abstract: We study extreme type-II superconductors described by the three dimensional
magnetic Ginzburg-Landau functional incorporating a pinning term
$a_\varepsilon(x)$, which we assume to be a bounded measurable function
satisfying $b\leq a_\varepsilon(x)\leq 1$ for some constant $b>0$. A hallmark
of such materials is the formation of vortex filaments, which emerge when the
applied magnetic field exceeds the first critical field $H_{c_1}$. In this
work, we provide a lower bound for this critical field and provide a
characterization of the Meissner solution, that is, the unique vortexless
configuration that globally minimizes the energy below $H_{c_1}$. Moreover, we
show that the onset of vorticity is intrinsically linked to a weighted variant
of the isoflux problem studied in [C. Rom\'an, On the First Critical Field in
the Three Dimensional Ginzburg-Landau Model of Superconductivity, Comm. Math.
Phys. 367 (2019), no.1, 317--349. arXiv:1802.09390] and [C. Rom\'an, \'E.

*Tim Heilmann*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes functionals involving a double well potential and the Gagliardo seminorm, showing compactness in BV functions and Γ-convergence to a surface tension functional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of functionals with a double well potential and seminorm as parameters approach limits, bridging analysis and variational methods.

Method: Study functionals with a double well potential and Gagliardo seminorm, analyze their limits as parameters vanish, and prove compactness and Γ-convergence.

Result: Compactness in BV functions and Γ-convergence to the classical surface tension functional are established.

Conclusion: The results connect the studied functionals to classical variational problems, providing insights into their limiting behavior.

Abstract: We study functionals \begin{equation*}
  F_\varepsilon (u) := \lambda_\varepsilon \int_\Omega W(u) \, dx +
  \varepsilon \|u\|_{H^{1/2}}^2 \end{equation*} for a double well potential $W$
and the Gagliardo seminorm $\|\cdot\|_{H^{1/2}}$ when $\varepsilon
\ln(\lambda_\varepsilon) \rightarrow k$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ and
show compactness in the space of $BV$ functions on $\Omega$ and the
$\Gamma$-convergence to the classical surface tension functional.

### [13] [Equivalent Characterizations and Their Applications of Solvability of $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-Regularity) Problems on Rough Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11103)
*Xuelian Fu,Dachun Yang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies the $L^p$ Poisson-Robin problem for elliptic operators on bounded domains, establishing solvability conditions and relationships with classical Robin problems, with applications to Laplace operators on Lipschitz domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend existing results on Dirichlet and Neumann problems to the Robin boundary condition, providing a comprehensive understanding of solvability and regularity for elliptic operators.

Method: Analyzes weak solutions to the Poisson-Robin problem using tent spaces, establishes equivalent solvability conditions, and clarifies connections to classical Robin problems.

Result: Proves solvability for $L^p$ Poisson-Robin and regularity problems on Lipschitz domains, with sharp ranges for $p$ and $q$.

Conclusion: The results generalize prior work on Dirichlet and Neumann problems, offering new insights into Robin boundary conditions for elliptic operators.

Abstract: Let $n\ge2$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded one-sided chord arc
domain, and $p\in(1,\infty)$. In this article, we study the (weak) $L^p$
Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem for a uniformly elliptic operator
$L:=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla\cdot)$ of divergence form on $\Omega$, which
considers weak solutions to the equation $Lu=h-\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{F}$ in
$\Omega$ with the Robin boundary condition $A\nabla
u\cdot\boldsymbol{\nu}+\alpha u=\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\boldsymbol{\nu}$ on the
boundary $\partial\Omega$ for functions $h$ and $\boldsymbol{F}$ in some tent
spaces. Precisely, we establish several equivalent characterizations of the
solvability of the (weak) $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem and clarify
the relationship between the $L^p$ Poisson--Robin(-regularity) problem and the
classical $L^p$ Robin problem. Moreover, we also give an extrapolation property
for the solvability of the classical $L^p$ Robin problem. As applications, we
further prove that, for the Laplace operator $-\Delta$ on the bounded Lipschitz
domain $\Omega$, the $L^p$ Poisson--Robin and the $L^q$
Poisson--Robin-regularity problems are respectively solvable for
$p\in(2-\varepsilon_1,\infty)$ and $q\in(1,2+\varepsilon_2)$, where
$\varepsilon_1\in(0,1]$ and $\varepsilon_2\in(0,\infty)$ are constants
depending only on $n$ and the Lipschitz constant of $\Omega$ and, moreover,
these ranges $(2-\varepsilon_1,\infty)$ of $p$ and $(1,2+\varepsilon_2)$ of $q$
are sharp. The main results in this article are the analogues of the
corresponding results of both the $L^p$ Poisson--Dirichlet(-regularity)
problem, established by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa [J. Eur. Math.
Soc. 2025], and of the $L^p$ Poisson--Neumann(-regularity) problem, established
by J. Feneuil and L. Li [arXiv: 2406.16735], in the Robin case.

### [14] [The motion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid: new results for strong solutions, uniqueness and integrability properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11105)
*Paolo Maremonti,Filippo Palma*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Two results are shown for Galdi-Silvestre strong solutions in rigid body-viscous fluid interaction: one proves the time derivative's L² integrability, and the other ensures uniqueness under additional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish integrability and uniqueness conditions for solutions in rigid body-viscous fluid interaction.

Method: Additional integrability assumptions on initial data gradients and further assumptions on solutions.

Result: Time derivative belongs to L² space, and uniqueness holds under specified conditions.

Conclusion: The set of solutions with uniqueness is non-empty, validated under the given assumptions.

Abstract: In this note, we show two results in the setting of Galdi-Silvestre strong
solutions for the rigid body-viscous fluid interaction. The former, under an
additional integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data, proves
that the time derivative of the solution belongs to $L^2(0,T;L^2({\Omega}))$.
The latter, thanks to a further assumption only on one solution, proves that
the uniqueness holds in the quoted setting. However, our extra assumption for
the uniqueness is certainly verified under the integrability assumption on the
gradient of the initial data. Hence, the set of solutions enjoying the
uniqueness is not empty.

TL;DR: The paper studies a time-fractional semilinear parabolic abstract Cauchy problem for a time-dependent sectorial operator, proving local and global existence of mild solutions under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the existence and properties of solutions for time-fractional semilinear parabolic problems with time-dependent operators.

Method: Proves local existence of mild solutions and extends to global existence using ultracontractivity estimates for fractional evolution families.

Result: Local and global existence of solutions is established under suitable assumptions on the initial data.

Conclusion: The results provide a framework for analyzing solutions to time-fractional parabolic problems with time-dependent operators.

Abstract: We consider a time-fractional semilinear parabolic abstract Cauchy problem
for a time-dependent sectorial operator $A(t)$ which satisfies the
Acquistapace-Terreni conditions. We first prove local existence results for the
mild solution of the problem at hand. Then we prove, under suitable assumptions
on the initial datum, that the solution is also global in time. This is
achieved by proving ultracontractivity estimates for the fractional evolution
families associated with the operator $A(t)$.

### [16] [Nonrelativistic limit of ground states to $L^2$-supercritical nonlinear Dirac equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11203)
*Pan Chen,Yanheng Ding,Qi Guo*

Main category: math.AP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the existence of ground states for large $c$ and their behavior in the nonrelativistic limit, particularly for the challenging $L^2$-supercritical case.

Method: The study involves analyzing the nonlinear Dirac equation with power-type potentials, focusing on large $c$ and the nonrelativistic limit.

Result: Existence of ground states for large $c$ is proven, and convergence to Schrödinger ground states is observed in the nonrelativistic limit.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the $L^2$-supercritical case and demonstrates the convergence of Dirac ground states to Schrödinger ground states as $c \to \infty$.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and nonrelativistic limit of normalized
ground states for the following nonlinear Dirac equation with power-type
potentials \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} &-i c\sum\limits_{k=1}^3\alpha_k\partial_k u +mc^2 \beta {u}-
|{u}|^{p-2}{u}=\omega {u}, \\ &\displaystyle\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\vert u \vert^2
dx =1.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} We demonstrate the existence of ground states for
large $c$ and establish the uniqueness of the associated Lagrange multiplier
for all $p \in (2,3)$. In particular, the case for $p \in (8/3, 3)$, often
referred to as $L^2$-supercritical and posing significant challenges to
existing methods, is primarily addressed in this paper. Furthermore, in the
nonrelativistic limit as $c \to \infty$, we observe that the first two
components of the Dirac ground states converge to Schr\"odinger ground states,
while the last two components vanish for all $p\in (2,3)$. This convergence is
related to the action of $SU(2)$.

TL;DR: The paper studies micropolar fluid behavior in thin domains with rough boundaries, deriving a simplified model and showing rough surfaces enhance slider bearing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by experimental findings in tribology, the study explores the effects of rough boundaries and nonzero microrotation boundary conditions on lubricant flow.

Method: Asymptotic analysis of a 3D boundary value problem with physically relevant boundary conditions, leading to a simplified model. Numerical simulations are then performed.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that rough surfaces improve the mechanical performance of linear slider bearings.

Conclusion: The study highlights the benefits of rough surfaces and nonzero boundary conditions in enhancing lubrication performance.

Abstract: The lubrication theory is mostly concerned with the behavior of a lubricant
flowing through a narrow gap. Motivated by the experimental findings from the
tribology literature, we take the lubricant to be micropolar fluid and study
its behavior in a thin domain with rough boundary. Instead of considering
(commonly used) simple zero boundary condition, we impose physically relevant
(nonzero) boundary condition for microrotation and perform asymptotic analysis
of the corresponding 3D boundary value problem. We formally derive a simplified
mathematical model acknowledging the roughness-induced effects and the effects
of the nonzero boundary conditions on the macroscopic flow. Using the obtained
asymptotic model, we study numerically the influence of the specific rugosity
profile on the performance of a linear slider bearing. The numerical results
clearly indicate that the use of the rough surfaces may contribute to enhance
the mechanical performance of such device.

*Zexing Li*

TL;DR: The paper analyzes self-similar blowup in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) in mass-supercritical regimes, focusing on asymptotic stability via linear mode stability of a matrix linearized operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by prior work on existence, stability, and profile construction for such dynamics, leading to the question of asymptotic stability.

Method: The problem is reduced to linear mode stability of the matrix linearized operator, using techniques like Jost function argument, WKB analysis, matched asymptotics, and uniform estimates for high spherical classes.

Result: Mode stability is proven for the low-energy spectrum in dimensions $d \ge 1$, treating it as a perturbation of the linearized operator around the ground state for mass-critical NLS.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the spectral bifurcation problem despite its non-self-adjoint and high-dimensional nature, advancing understanding of asymptotic stability in NLS.

Abstract: We consider self-similar blowup for (NLS) $i\partial_t u + \Delta u +
u|u|^{p-1} = 0$ in $d \ge 1$ and slightly mass-supercritical range $0 < s_c :=
\frac d2 - \frac{2}{p-1} \ll 1$. The existence and stability of such dynamics
[Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010] and construction of suitable profiles
[Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] lead to the question of asymptotic stability.
Based on our previous work [Li, 2023], this nonlinear problem is reduced to
linear mode stability of the matrix linearized operator. In this work, we prove
mode stability for the low-energy spectrum in $d \ge 1$ as a perturbation of
the linearized operator around ground state for mass-critical NLS. The main
difficulty of this spectral bifurcation problem arises from the
non-self-adjoint, relatively unbounded and high-dimensional nature, for which
we exploit the Jost function argument from [Perelman, 2001], qualitative WKB
analysis generalized from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021], matched asymptotics
method and uniform estimates for high spherical classes based on special
functions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes pointwise statistics of solutions to linear and nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs with random initial data, deriving evolution equations for PDFs and CDFs, and discusses their practical implications for efficient computation and error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the statistical behavior of solutions to hyperbolic PDEs with random initial conditions, enabling efficient computation and error analysis without relying on ensemble simulations.

Method: For linear hyperbolic PDEs, the PDF satisfies the same PDE. For nonlinear cases, a transport equation for the CDF and a nonlocal PDE for the PDF are derived, valid until shock formation. Multi-point statistics are introduced for systems.

Result: Derived evolution equations for PDFs and CDFs, enabling efficient computation of random dynamics without ensemble simulations. Also provided statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: The derived equations offer practical tools for analyzing hyperbolic PDEs with random data, with limitations due to shock formation, and provide insights into error bounds for computational methods.

Abstract: We consider one-dimensional hyperbolic PDEs, linear and nonlinear, with
random initial data. Our focus is the {\em pointwise statistics,} i.e., the
probability measure of the solution at any fixed point in space and time. For
linear hyperbolic equations, the probability density function (PDF) of these
statistics satisfies the same linear PDE. For nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs, we
derive a linear transport equation for the cumulative distribution function
(CDF) and a nonlocal linear PDE for the PDF. Both results are valid only as
long as no shocks have formed, a limitation which is inherent to the problem,
as demonstrated by a counterexample. For systems of linear hyperbolic
equations, we introduce the multi-point statistics and derive their evolution
equations. In all of the settings we consider, the resulting PDEs for the
statistics are of practical significance: they enable efficient evaluation of
the random dynamics, without requiring an ensemble of solutions of the
underlying PDE, and their cost is not affected by the dimension of the random
parameter space. Additionally, the evolution equations for the statistics lead
to a priori statistical error bounds for Monte Carlo methods (in particular,
Kernel Density Estimators) when applied to hyperbolic PDEs with random data.

Motivation: The study aims to answer questions from prior works [Bahri-Martel-Raphaël, 2021] and [Merle-Raphaël-Szeftel, 2010] regarding the asymptotic stability of self-similar blowup and the behavior near ground states.

Method: The core method involves a linear Liouville argument to reformulate the eigen problem as rigidity of linear dynamics, incorporating modulation and nonlinear dynamical controls. Numerical verification from prior works supports the approach.

Result: The paper concludes the asymptotic stability of self-similar blowup and characterizes the spectrum for linearized operators around mass-critical ground states in dimensions 1 to 10.

Conclusion: The findings resolve open questions and provide insights for future studies on asymptotic behavior near ground states, leveraging a combination of theoretical and numerical methods.

Abstract: In continuation of the study of the companion work, we prove the high-energy
mode stability for linearized operator around self-similar profiles in
[Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] for slightly mass-supercritical NLS in $1 \le d
\le 10$. This concludes the asymptotic stability of such self-similar blowup,
and answers the question from [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021] and
[Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010]. As a byproduct, we characterize the spectrum
for linearized operator around mass-critical ground state for $1 \le d \le 10$,
which could be useful for future studies of asymptotic behavior near ground
state. The core idea is a linear Liouville argument, originated by Martel-Merle
[Martel-Merle, 2000, 2001] studying soliton stability, to reformulate the eigen
problem as rigidity of linear dynamics so as to introduce modulation and to
apply nonlinear dynamical controls. Our controlling quantities were verified
with numerical help in [Merle-Rapha\"el, 2005; Fibich-Merle-Rapha\"el, 2006;
Yang-Roudenko-Zhao, 2018] for $1 \le d \le 10$.

Conclusion: The work extends classical results to stochastic contexts and provides insights into dissipation enhancement in noisy systems.

Abstract: We prove a stochastic version of the classical RAGE theorem that applies to
the two-point motion generated by noisy transport equations. As a consequence,
we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the corresponding
diffusive equation to be dissipation enhancing. This involves the
identification of a non-trivial, finite dimensional subspace that is invariant
for the family of self-adjoint operator characterizing the structure of the
transport noise. We discuss several examples and prove a sharp enhanced
dissipation rate for stochastic shear flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The partially dissipative systems that characterize many physical phenomena
were first pointed out by Godunov (1961), then investigated by Friedrichs-Lax
(1971) who introduced the convex entropy, and later by Shizuta-Kawashima
(1984,1985) who initiated a simple sufficient criterion ensuring the global
existence of smooth solutions and their large-time asymptotics. There has been
remarkable progress in the past several decades, through various different
attempts. However, the decay character theory for partially dissipative
hyperbolic systems remains largely open, as the Fourier transform of Green's
function is generally not explicit in multi-dimensions. In this paper, we
propose a general $L^p$ energy method and provide the positive answer to the
unsolved question left in [5]. Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima
conditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the
partially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different
exponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high
frequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time
integrability of Lipschitz bound. Furthermore, a new effective quantity
$\Psi(t,x)$ capturing the interaction of conservative and dissipative
components is introduced, which enables us to establish the sharp
characterization of large-time asymptotic behavior. Finally, we also show that,
with faster orders of convergence, the conservative and dissipative components
of solutions can be asymptotically approximated by new profiles generated from
parabolic systems subjected to $\Psi_0$ (the initial effective quantity), in
the spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion.

TL;DR: LaSDI-IT is a data-driven framework for modeling systems with sharp interfaces, combining latent dynamics learning and interface-aware encoding to achieve accurate, efficient predictions with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of capturing sharp, evolving interfaces in reduced-order modeling, especially with limited data and localized nonlinearities, drives the need for a method like LaSDI-IT.

Method: LaSDI-IT uses a revised auto-encoder to jointly reconstruct physical fields and material regions, learning latent dynamics via linear regression and Gaussian process interpolation.

Result: The method achieves <9% prediction errors, accurately tracks key quantities, and is 106x faster than high-fidelity simulations, even with half the training data.

Conclusion: LaSDI-IT is a versatile, data-efficient framework for discontinuity-rich systems, with broad applications in computational physics.

Abstract: Capturing sharp, evolving interfaces remains a central challenge in
reduced-order modeling, especially when data is limited and the system exhibits
localized nonlinearities or discontinuities. We propose LaSDI-IT (Latent Space
Dynamics Identification for Interface Tracking), a data-driven framework that
combines low-dimensional latent dynamics learning with explicit interface-aware
encoding to enable accurate and efficient modeling of physical systems
involving moving material boundaries. At the core of LaSDI-IT is a revised
auto-encoder architecture that jointly reconstructs the physical field and an
indicator function representing material regions or phases, allowing the model
to track complex interface evolution without requiring detailed physical models
or mesh adaptation. The latent dynamics are learned through linear regression
in the encoded space and generalized across parameter regimes using Gaussian
process interpolation with greedy sampling. We demonstrate LaSDI-IT on the
problem of shock-induced pore collapse in high explosives, a process
characterized by sharp temperature gradients and dynamically deforming pore
geometries. The method achieves relative prediction errors below 9% across the
parameter space, accurately recovers key quantities of interest such as pore
area and hot spot formation, and matches the performance of dense training with
only half the data. This latent dynamics prediction was 106 times faster than
the conventional high-fidelity simulation, proving its utility for multi-query
applications. These results highlight LaSDI-IT as a general, data-efficient
framework for modeling discontinuity-rich systems in computational physics,
with potential applications in multiphase flows, fracture mechanics, and phase
change problems.

TL;DR: Omnisoot, a computational tool, models carbonaceous nanoparticle formation using Cantera, integrating reactor models and inception/population balance models to predict soot properties under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an integrated tool for predicting soot mass, morphology, and composition by combining gas-phase chemistry with particle dynamics.

Method: Omnisoot combines reactor models (constant volume, pressure, stirred, plug flow) with inception and population balance models (monodisperse, sectional) to simulate soot formation.

Result: The tool highlighted differences in inception models for soot prediction, showing the need for morphology data to constrain rates and identifying irreversible models as capable of predicting bimodal size distributions.

Conclusion: Omnisoot is effective for soot prediction but requires measured morphology data for accurate inception and growth rate constraints.

Abstract: A computational tool, Omnisoot, was developed utilizing the chemical kinetics
capabilities of Cantera to model the formation of carbonaceous nanoparticles,
such as soot and Carbon Black (CB), from the reactions of gaseous hydrocarbons.
Omnisoot integrates constant volume, constant pressure, perfectly stirred, and
plug flow reactor models with four inception models from the literature, as
well as two population balance models: a monodisperse model and a sectional
model. This package serves as an integrated process design tool to predict soot
mass, morphology, and composition under varying process conditions. The
modeling approach accounts for soot inception, surface growth, and oxidation,
coupled with detailed gas-phase chemistry, to close the mass and energy
balances of the gas-particle system; subsequently, soot and gas-phase chemistry
are linked to the particle dynamics models that consider the evolving
fractal-like structure of soot agglomerates. The developed tool was employed to
highlight the similarities and differences among the implemented inception
models in predicting soot mass, morphology, and size distribution for three
use-cases: methane pyrolysis in a shock tube, ethylene pyrolysis in a flow
reactor, and ethylene combustion in a perfectly stirred reactor. The
simulations of 5% $\mathrm{CH_4}$ pyrolysis in shock-tube with short residence
times ($\approx1.5$ ms) demonstrated that multiple combinations of inception
and surface growth rates minimized the prediction error for carbon yield but
led to markedly different morphologies, emphasizing the need for measured data
on soot morphology to constrain inception and surface growth rates. The
comparison of simulation results in a pyrolysis flow reactor at three different
flow rates suggested that only irreversible models can predict bimodality in
particle size distribution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer matrix methods are inefficient for large-scale simulations and lack support for automatic differentiation, limiting their use in modern design approaches.

Method: TMMax vectorizes and accelerates the transfer matrix method using JAX, supporting CPU, GPU, and TPU hardware, and includes a material database and analysis tools.

Result: Benchmarking shows TMMax achieves a 100x speedup over NumPy, enabling rapid simulation of complex thin-film structures with hundreds of layers.

Conclusion: TMMax provides a scalable and efficient solution for multilayer thin-film simulations, enhancing the design process for photonic systems.

Abstract: Optical multilayer thin-films are fundamental components that enable the
precise control of reflectance, transmittance, and phase shift in the design of
photonic systems. Rapid and accessible simulation of these structures holds
critical importance for designing and analyzing complex coatings, such as
distributed Bragg reflectors, anti-reflection layers, and spectral filters.
While researchers commonly use the traditional transfer matrix method for
designing these structures, its scalar approach to wavelength and angle of
incidence causes redundant recalculations and inefficiencies in large-scale
simulations. Furthermore, traditional method implementations do not support
automatic differentiation, which limits their applicability in gradient-based
inverse design approaches. Here, we present TMMax, a Python library that fully
vectorizes and accelerates transfer matrix method using the high-performance
machine learning library JAX. TMMax supports CPU, GPU, and TPU hardware,
includes a publicly available material database, and offers comprehensive
multilayer optical thin-film analysis tools. Our approach, demonstrated through
benchmarking, allows us to model thin-film stacks with hundreds of layers
within seconds. This illustrates that our method achieves a simulation speedup
of x100s over a baseline NumPy implementation, providing a significant
advantage in computational efficiency. Our method enables rapid and scalable
simulations of large and complex multilayer thin-film structures, significantly
accelerating the design process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical collisional models fail to fully capture EEDF features in plasmas, especially during the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic regimes.

Method: Applies renormalization group (RG) techniques to the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation to derive non-perturbative EEDF solutions.

Result: Predicts bimodal EEDF in the kinetic limit and generalized exponential EEDF in the hydrodynamic limit, with a critical pressure separating them. Links the system's behavior to minimum entropy production.

Conclusion: The theory explains universal EEDF data collapse and resolves issues like Godyak's EEDF metamorphosis, providing a thermodynamic basis for plasma self-organization.

Abstract: The electron energy distribution function (EEDF) in low-temperature plasmas
exhibits features not fully captured by classical collisional models,
particularly across the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic regimes. This
work attributes these phenomena to a dynamically broken scale invariance within
the Vlasov-Boltzmann equation. By applying renormalization group (RG)
techniques directly to the kinetic operator, we derive non-perturbative EEDF
solutions valid across a range of collisionality. The formalism yields analytic
scaling relations for electron heating and predicts the emergence of distinct
EEDF forms - bimodal in the kinetic limit and generalized exponential in the
hydrodynamic limit - separated by a critical pressure. It is shown that the
stable RG fixed point governing the system's long-time behavior corresponds to
a state of minimum entropy production, establishing a thermodynamic basis for
plasma self-organization. The theory provides a quantitative explanation for
the experimentally observed universal data collapse of rescaled EEDFs and
resolves standing issues like Godyak's EEDF metamorphosis.

TL;DR: The paper develops a predictive RG analysis for plasma-surface coupling, revealing asymptotic freedom and scaling relations for grain size, with testable predictions for thin film synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between plasma processing parameters and film microstructure to move beyond empirical process design.

Method: Renormalization group (RG) analysis applied to an effective Hamiltonian for stochastic plasma-surface dynamics, derived from microscopic principles.

Result: Asymptotic freedom of the plasma-surface coupling, scaling relation for grain area, and testable predictions like pressure-independence of grain size.

Conclusion: Establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse framework for predicting and controlling thin film microstructure.

Abstract: Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure
remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely
confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop
a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG)
analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the
plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles.
The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic
freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the
growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales,
a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of
continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG
framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area,
$\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by
fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time
($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed
empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to
specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable
predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within
collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c =
1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on
crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine
for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film
synthesis.

Motivation: To understand the impact of secondary electron yield (SEY) and external circuit changes on dcMS discharge properties and compare the performance of EC-PIC and MC-PIC methods.

Method: Uses a 2D cylindrically symmetric PIC simulation with MCC for electron-neutral collisions, comparing EC-PIC and MC-PIC algorithms.

Result: Higher SEY and lower external resistance increase currents and plasma densities while reducing voltages. EC-PIC outperforms MC-PIC in stability for high plasma conditions.

Conclusion: EC-PIC is more stable and effective than MC-PIC for simulating dcMS discharges, especially at higher plasma currents and densities.

Abstract: We present results from a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of
direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) in a 2D cylindrically symmetric
geometry. The particle-in-cell model assumes an electrostatic approximation and
includes the Monte Carlo collision (MCC) method to model collisions between
electrons and the neutral gas. A newly-implemented explicit energy-conserving
PIC algorithm (EC-PIC) is also exercised by the model and results are compared
with the standard momentum conserving PIC (MC-PIC) method. We use these
simulation tools to examine how changes in secondary electron yield (SEY) and
the external circuit impact the steady-state current, voltage, and plasma
density of dcMS discharges. We show that in general, higher SEY and lower
external resistance values lead to larger currents, smaller voltages, and
larger plasma densities. We demonstrate that EC-PIC is superior to MC-PIC as
the plasma current and density increase due to the improved numerical stability
provided by EC-PIC.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the impact of nonlinear substrates on Shapiro steps and provides diagnostic tools (sixfold coordination fraction and kinetic temperature) to distinguish harmonic and subharmonic behaviors.

Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the depinning
dynamics of a two-dimensional solid dusty plasma, which is modulated by
one-dimensional nonlinear deformed periodic substrates, and also driven by the
combination of the DC and AC forces. As the DC driving force increases
gradually, pronounced subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are discovered
under the combined modulation of the deformed substrate and the external AC
drive. These observed subharmonic and harmonic Shapiro steps are attributed to
the dynamic mode locking. The data analysis results indicate that the nonlinear
deformed substrate strongly influences these subharmonic Shapiro steps, which
can be accurately diagnosed using the fraction of sixfold coordinated
particles. Furthermore, the diagnostic of the kinetic temperature clearly
indicates the difference between harmonic and subharmonic Shapiro steps, i.e.,
the particle motion is slightly less synchronized at subharmonic Shapiro steps,
caused by the unstable locations of the deformed substrate.

Motivation: To improve recursive least squares algorithms by introducing rank two updates and combining forgetting methods, addressing limitations in existing RLS algorithms.

Method: Develop RLSR2 algorithms with exponential and instantaneous forgetting, analyze their properties, and compare them to rank one RLS algorithms. Test performance in grid event estimation with harmonic noise.

Result: New properties for convergence and performance improvement are established. RLSR2 algorithms show effectiveness in grid event estimation despite harmonic interference.

Conclusion: RLSR2 algorithms offer enhanced performance and new insights for recursive least squares, particularly in noisy environments like grid event estimation.

Abstract: New recursive least squares algorithms with rank two updates (RLSR2) that
include both exponential and instantaneous forgetting (implemented via a proper
choice of the forgetting factor and the window size) are introduced and
systematically associated in this report with well-known RLS algorithms with
rank one updates. Moreover, new properties (which can be used for further
performance improvement) of the recursive algorithms associated with the

TL;DR: The paper explores tilt stability in composite optimization problems, using second-order generalized differentiation to characterize it under weak conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical foundation for variational stability and numerical algorithms in optimization.

Method: Investigates tilt stability via second-order generalized differentiation under metric subregularity and other conditions.

Result: Unified neighborhood and point-based characterizations of tilt stability are established.

Conclusion: The findings support further developments in optimization theory and numerical methods.

Abstract: Tilt stability is a fundamental concept of variational analysis and
optimization that plays a pivotal role in both theoretical issues and numerical
computations. This paper investigates tilt stability of local minimizers for a
general class of composite optimization problems in finite dimensions, where
extended-real-valued objectives are compositions of parabolically regular and
smooth functions. Under the weakest metric subregularity constraint
qualification and other verifiable conditions, we establish unified
neighborhood and pointbased characterizations of tilt stability via
second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained results provide a
rigorous theoretical foundation for further developments on variational
stability and numerical algorithms of optimization and related topics.

TL;DR: Two noise-tolerant OFFO algorithms for bound-constrained optimization are introduced, with convergence guarantees and strong performance in applications like PDEs and deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address optimization challenges with noise, bound constraints, and inexact gradients while leveraging second-order information when available.

Method: 1. Multi-level hierarchical method. 2. Domain-decomposition method (additive Schwarz). Both generalize AdaGrad for unconstrained optimization.

Result: Both methods require at most O(ε⁻²) iterations to find an ε-approximate critical point, with high probability.

Conclusion: The algorithms are computationally efficient, validated by extensive experiments in PDEs and deep learning.

Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are
presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order
information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a
hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a
domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz
decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm
for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common
theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which
covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods
need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to
compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the
bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on
applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training,
illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: Light-activated colloids in nematic liquid crystals exhibit adaptive motion and quorum-sensing, mimicking life-like behaviors without complex feedback engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between synthetic microswimmers and adaptive living organisms by leveraging liquid crystal and colloid properties.

Method: Experiments, simulations, and theory to study colloid motion under varying nematic anchoring (homeotropic/planar) and crowding conditions.

Result: Colloids switch motion types based on anchoring and adjust motility via quorum-sensing, leading to clustering phase separation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a simple route to adaptive, life-like materials using liquid crystals and colloids.

Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in
ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates
for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback
mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an
experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic
liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending
on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in
response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both
features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled
through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a
single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active
Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by
directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar.
Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a
clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our
work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities
using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without
explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through
instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction,
and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical
properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials'
microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is
challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning
offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present
a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical
responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The
microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17
wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric
space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based
computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries,
each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our
dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models,
facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables
investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations,
potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A multi-phase-field framework is introduced to study solid-state dewetting (SSD) in polycrystalline thin films, capturing grain boundaries and triple junctions, with analytical criteria for dewetting onset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding SSD in polycrystalline films is complex due to grain boundaries, unlike single-crystalline films. Existing theories focus on single-crystalline SSD, leaving polycrystalline cases underexplored.

Method: A multi-phase-field framework is developed, incorporating isotropic surface/interface energy and curvature-driven grain boundary motion, validated by numerical simulations.

Result: The framework reproduces SSD phenomenology, confirms dewetting onset at grain-boundary triple junctions, and showcases SSD in polycrystalline patches.

Conclusion: This work advances the study of polycrystalline thin films' morphological evolution, providing a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Solid-state dewetting (SSD) is the process by which thin solid films break up
and retract on a substrate, resulting in the formation of nanostructures and
islands. While SSD in single-crystalline films is generally understood as a
surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline
films feature additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries.
Theoretical investigations and simulation frameworks have mainly focused on
single-crystalline SSD. In this work, we present and apply a multi-phase-field
framework that captures key mechanisms in polycrystalline thin films with
multiple grains and grain boundaries in three dimensions. By considering
isotropic surface and interface energy and curvature-driven grain boundary
motion, we demonstrate how the framework reproduces the key phenomenology of
SSD while being consistent with predictions based on energetic arguments. We
also introduce refined analytical criteria for the onset of dewetting,
confirmed by numerical simulations. Key evidence is given concerning the onset
of dewetting at grain-boundary triple junctions. Moreover, we showcase SSD of
polycrystalline patches. This work paves the way for in-depth investigations of
the morphological evolution of polycrystalline thin films.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of
$10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\'enic,
characterized by $\delta B_{\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an
extended inertial range such that the Alfv\'en scale $l_A$, where $\delta B
(l_A)\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the
cascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes
on small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key
mediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature
scattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows
strong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence
over almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk
exhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the
diffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results
suggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering
over a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations
above a $\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR
primary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.

Motivation: To improve optimization in variational quantum Monte Carlo by leveraging geometric insights into function space, unifying existing methods, and deriving novel algorithms.

Method: Translates infinite-dimensional optimization dynamics into parameter-space algorithms via Galerkin projection onto the tangent space of the variational ansatz.

Result: Validated through numerical experiments, accurately estimating ground-state energies for condensed matter models using neural network wavefunctions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unifies and extends existing methods, offering practical improvements for variational quantum Monte Carlo optimization.

Abstract: We propose a framework for the design and analysis of optimization algorithms

TL;DR: A method using quantics tensor trains to analyze multi-point correlators identifies quantum phase transitions and thermal crossovers, validated on Hubbard and Anderson models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose time scale entanglement and distinguish between quantum phase transitions and thermal crossovers using flexible correlator analysis.

Method: Compress multi-point correlators into quantics tensor trains, study bond dimension as an entanglement indicator, and apply to Hubbard and Anderson models.

Result: Peaks in bond dimension correlate with phase transitions and crossovers, showing time scale entanglement as a system-inherent property.

Conclusion: The method effectively identifies transitions and crossovers, linking bond dimension to entanglement and other physical quantities.

Abstract: We propose a new method based on the compression of arbitrary multi-point
correlators into quantics tensor trains and studying its so called bond
dimension as an indicator of time scale entanglement in the system. This
quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum
phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii)
distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using
arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with
low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We
verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the
Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest
neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale
entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase
transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor
train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of
the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures
and susceptibilities, is shown.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) property for Riemann differences of order n, disproving a conjecture and providing a general classification using a recurrence framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when Riemann differences of order n satisfy the MZ property, disprove a conjecture about geometric nodes, and develop a general analytic criterion.

Method: Develops a recurrence framework to analyze conditions under which a function R(h) forces R(h) = o(h^n), leading to a complete analytic criterion.

Result: Proves the MZ property holds if and only if A lies outside a critical modulus annulus, characterizing all Riemann differences with geometric nodes that satisfy the MZ property.

Conclusion: The study provides a complete classification of Riemann differences with the MZ property and a flexible analytic framework for broader applications.

Abstract: We study when a Riemann difference of order $ n $ possesses the
Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) property: that is, whether the conditions $ f(h) =
o(h^{n-1}) $ and $ Df(h) = o(h^n) $ imply $ f(h) = o(h^n) $. This implication
is known to hold for some classical examples with geometric nodes, such as $
\{0, 1, q, \dots, q^{n-1}\} $ and $ \{1, q, \dots, q^n\} $, leading to a
conjecture that these are the only such Riemann differences with the MZ
property. However, this conjecture was disproved by the third-order example
with nodes $ \{-1, 0, 1, 2\} $, and we provide further counterexamples and a
general classification here.
  We establish a complete analytic criterion for the MZ property by developing
a recurrence framework: we analyze when a function $ R(h) $ satisfying $ D(h) =
R(qh) - A R(h) $, together with $ D(h) = o(h^n) $ and $ R(h) = o(h^{n-1}) $,
forces $ R(h) = o(h^n) $. We prove that this holds if and only if $ A $ lies
outside a critical modulus annulus determined by $ q $ and $ n $, covering both
$ |q| > 1 $ and $ |q| < 1 $ cases. This leads to a complete characterization of
all Riemann differences with geometric nodes that possess the MZ property, and
provides a flexible analytic framework applicable to broader classes of
generalized differences.

Motivation: To leverage mixed-precision gains from AI for HPC, especially for memory bandwidth-limited scientific simulations.

Result: Achieved a 1.6x speedup using mixed-precision (double- and single-precision) on modern GPU-based supercomputers.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision can significantly enhance performance in HPC, even for sparse matrix applications, as demonstrated by the HPG-MxP benchmark.

Abstract: Mixed-precision algorithms have been proposed as a way for scientific
computing to benefit from some of the gains seen for artificial intelligence
(AI) on recent high performance computing (HPC) platforms. A few applications
dominated by dense matrix operations have seen substantial speedups by
utilizing low precision formats such as FP16. However, a majority of scientific
simulation applications are memory bandwidth limited. Beyond preliminary
studies, the practical gain from using mixed-precision algorithms on a given
HPC system is largely unclear.
  The High Performance GMRES Mixed Precision (HPG-MxP) benchmark has been
proposed to measure the useful performance of a HPC system on sparse
matrix-based mixed-precision applications. In this work, we present a highly
optimized implementation of the HPG-MxP benchmark for an exascale system and
describe our algorithm enhancements. We show for the first time a speedup of

TL;DR: A CFD model for water flushing in pipelines was validated and optimized, showing higher water velocity and small bubbles reduce water consumption by 28% and 35%, respectively, while large bubbles increase it by 23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient flushing strategies are needed to reduce water usage and costs in industrial slurry pipelines, promoting sustainability.

Method: A CFD model coupled with granular flow theory was validated using field data from a coal slurry pipeline. Parametric studies evaluated water velocity, bubble size, and volume fraction.

Result: Higher water velocity (1.88-5.88 m/s) reduced water consumption by 28%. Small bubbles (50 µm) cut consumption by 35%, while large bubbles (1000 µm) increased it by 23%.

Conclusion: Optimizing water velocity and using small bubbles enhances flushing efficiency and conserves water, supporting sustainable pipeline operations.

Abstract: Water flushing to remove particle sediment is essential for safe and
continuous transport of many industrial slurries through pipelines. An
efficient flushing strategy may reduce water consumption and the cost
associated with water usage, and help water conservation for sustainability. In
this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled with the kinetic
theory of granular flow for the flushing process is presented. The CFD models
were validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128
$km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than
15\% for outlet solid concentration over time. A parametric study evaluated the
effects of water velocity (1.88-5.88~$m/s$), bubble size (50~$\mu m$, 150~$\mu
m$, and 1000~$\mu m$) and bubble volume fraction (0.05-0.2) on flushing
performance including pipeline cleanness, cleanness efficiency, and water
consumption. The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is
preferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$
reduces the water consumption by $28\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing
process and increase the water consumption by $23\%$. Remarkably, small bubbles
facilitates the flushing process and lead to $35\%$ reduction in water
consumption. These effects are attributed to the turbulent characteristics in
the pipelines in presence of microbubbles.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GALDS, a Graph-Autoencoder-based model for efficient simulation of material transport in neural trees, achieving high accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for simulating material transport in neuron networks are computationally intensive. The complex geometry of neurite networks and steady-state properties offer optimization opportunities.

Method: GALDS uses a graph autoencoder to encode network geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles into latent representations. A graph latent space dynamic model, inspired by Neural ODEs, predicts system dynamics.

Result: GALDS achieves mean relative error of 3% (max <8%) and a 10-fold speed improvement over previous surrogate models, validated on unseen and abnormal transport cases.

Conclusion: GALDS provides an efficient and accurate solution for simulating material transport in neural trees, leveraging graph autoencoders and Neural ODEs to overcome computational challenges.

Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which
play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport.
Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for
understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational
challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional
approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent
properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state
parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for
computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a
Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is
specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in
neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent
representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration
profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global
graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent
space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration
of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models
with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component
effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated
through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport
examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum
relative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to
previous surrogate model approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption of a two-dimensional diffusion region in magnetic reconnection studies by revealing three-dimensional complexities.

Method: Utilized observations from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to analyze the EDR and IDR in Earth's magnetotail.

Result: Found a 38° deviation between EDR and IDR planes, a twofold guide field amplitude increase, and differing Hall current structures (bipolar vs. quadrupolar).

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of 3D effects and multiscale coupling complexity in magnetic reconnection studies.

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that alters the
magnetic field topology and releases magnetic energy. Most numerical
simulations and spacecraft observations assume a two-dimensional diffusion
region, with the electron diffusion region (EDR) embedded in the same plane as
the ion diffusion region (IDR) and a uniform guide field throughout. Using
observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we report a
non-coplanar, knotted EDR in Earth's magnetotail current sheet. The
reconnection plane of the knotted EDR deviates by approximately 38{\deg} from
that of the IDR, with the guide field exhibiting both a 38{\deg} directional
shift and a twofold increase in amplitude. Moreover, the Hall magnetic field is
bipolar in the EDR but quadrupolar in the IDR, indicating different Hall
current structures at electron and ion scales. These observations highlight the
importance of three-dimensional effects and illustrate the complexity of
multiscale coupling between the EDR and IDR during reconnection studies.1

Motivation: To understand and characterize wave interactions in time-dependent resonator systems, enabling the design of energy-controlling devices.

Result: Shows energy flux composition, derives an optical theorem, and identifies lasing points with divergent energy. Numerical experiments reveal impacts of time-dependency and resonator count.

Conclusion: Provides foundational insights for designing energy-dissipative or amplifying systems, with potential applications in wave control.

Abstract: We study wave propagation through a one-dimensional array of subwavelength
resonators with periodically time-modulated material parameters. Focusing on a
high-contrast regime, we use a scattering framework based on Fourier expansions
and scattering matrix techniques to capture the interactions between an
incident wave and the temporally varying system. This way, we derive a
formulation of the total energy flux corresponding to time-dependent systems of
resonators. We show that the total energy flux is composed of the transmitted
and reflected energy fluxes, and derive an optical theorem which characterises
the energy balance of the system. We provide a number of numerical experiments
to investigate the impact of the time-dependency, the operating frequency and
the number of resonators on the maximal attainable energy gain and energy loss.
Moreover, we show the existence of lasing points, at which the total energy
diverges. Our results lay the foundation for the design of energy dissipative
or energy amplifying systems.

Motivation: To explore understudied internal migration patterns and challenge assumptions of gravity models in migration studies.

Method: Uses inferential network methods on high-granularity administrative records to analyze migration flows between municipalities.

Result: Finds significant deviations from gravity law predictions, with persistent regional biases and urban-rural divides.

Conclusion: Demonstrates limitations of gravity models and offers a robust methodology for improved migration analysis.

Abstract: Migration is central in various societal problems related to socioeconomic
development. While much of the existing research has focused on international
migration, migration patterns within a single country remain relatively
unexplored. In this work we study internal migration patterns in Austria for a
period of over 20 years, obtained from open and high-granularity administrative
records. We employ inferential network methods to characterize the flows
between municipalities and extract their clustering according to similar target
and destination rates. Our methodology reveals significant deviations from
commonly assumed relocation patterns modeled by the gravity law. At the same
time, we observe unexpected biases of internal migrations that leads to less
frequent movements across boundaries at both district and state levels than
predictions suggest. This leads to significant regionalization of migration at
multiple geographical scales and augmented division between urban and rural
areas. These patterns appear to be remarkably persistent across decades of
migration data, demonstrating systematic limitations of conventionally used
gravity models in migration studies. Our approach presents a robust methodology
that can be used to improve such evaluations, and can reveal new phenomena in
migration networks.

### [49] [Closed Form Time Derivatives of the Equations of Motion of Rigid Body Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11076)
*Andreas Mueller,Shivesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents closed-form second-order time derivatives of rigid body EOM, offering a compact alternative to recursive algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Derivatives of EOM are crucial for robotics, especially in control and design, requiring smooth trajectories and force/torque derivatives.

Method: Uses Lie group formulation for rigid body systems to derive compact, parameterized equations.

Result: Provides direct insight into the structure of EOM derivatives up to second-order.

Conclusion: The closed-form approach is a viable alternative to recursive methods for EOM derivatives.

Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body
systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find
many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots,
and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only
requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control
forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of
the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the
existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight
into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body
systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.

### [50] [Spin Relaxation Mechanisms and Nuclear Spin Entanglement of the V$_B^{-1}$ Center in hBN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11494)
*Chanaprom Cholsuk,Tobias Vogl,Viktor Ivády*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of the $V_B^-$ defect in hBN using a spin dynamics model, revealing its dependence on magnetic fields and nuclear spin interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The $V_B^-$ defect is a promising spin qubit, but its spin relaxation mechanisms are poorly understood, limiting its potential for quantum sensing.

Method: A parameter-free spin dynamics model based on cluster-expansion is developed to study $T_1$ relaxation at low temperatures, incorporating electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions.

Result: The model reproduces experimental $T_1$ times and predicts their dependence on magnetic fields (0-2000 G), driven by hyperfine and dipolar interactions.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable approach for understanding $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers, aiding future nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to
its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals
structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence
properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its
control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin
dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$
relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$
center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which
necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects
of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework,
this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B =
90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic
field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation
is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop
processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study
establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in
$V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments
in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.
