In FWI,\napproximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for\nNewton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and\nimproving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient.
