In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging\niterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to\nreach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods\nspecifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of\nimproving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of\n``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates\nto the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the\nbest known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the\nsequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the\niterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point\niterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself\nhas proven highly successful across various areas of physics.

D; 12 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a\ncrucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations,\ngravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model\nthese phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with\nthe polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the\nelastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of\ncrystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some\nassumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or\nconstrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed\nassumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe\nelastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The\nbulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the\nshear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars,\nthe variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse\nthe Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the\nelectron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static\ncrystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the\neffective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically\napplied in the astrophysical literature."}
