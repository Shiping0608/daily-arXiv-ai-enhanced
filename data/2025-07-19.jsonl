Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the\nalgorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we\nexamine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose\nto use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it\nconverges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not\nparacontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the\nnatural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show\nhow Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine\nan approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have\njust to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple\nalgorithms from linear algebra can be applied."}
