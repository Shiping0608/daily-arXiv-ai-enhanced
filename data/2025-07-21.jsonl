We employ 2D and 3D hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and\nfluid electrons) to explore particle acceleration and magnetic field\namplification in non-relativistic perpendicular shocks, focusing on the role of\nshock drift acceleration and its dependence on the shock Mach number. We\nperform an analysis of the ion injection process and demonstrate why efficient\nacceleration is only observed in 3D. In particular, we show that ion injection\ncritically depends on the \"porosity\" of the magnetic turbulence in the\ndownstream region near the shock, a property describing how easily the\npost-shock region allows particles to traverse it and return upstream without\nbeing trapped. This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally,\nwe explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting\nhow resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion\ngyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection.
