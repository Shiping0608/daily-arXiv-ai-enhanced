The aim is to reconstruct the moving orbit from the\ntangential components of magnetic fields taken at a finite number of\nobservation points. The distance function between each observation point and\nthe moving point source is computed by solving a nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equation with an initial value. This ODE system only involves the\nmeasurement data from the tangential trace of the magnetic field at observation\npoints. As a consequence, the dynamical measurement data recorded at four\nnon-coplanar points are sufficient to reconstruct the orbit function. A\nLipschitz stability is established for the inverse problem, and numerical\nexperiments are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. Numerical examples have shown that the reconstructed error depends\nlinearly on the noise level and that the wave speed is a critical factor\naffecting the relative error."}

To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald\nSummation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization,\nand Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force\ntraining data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with\nany short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as\nMACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct\nsystems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on\ndefective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct\nelectrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large\nand chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing\nmolecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic\nsystems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its\nshort-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts\ndipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids.

We analyze one sixth order and two eighth order\ncompact spatial discretization schemes, encompassing both node centered and\ncell centered formulations, combined with a third order strong stability\npreserving Runge Kutta (SSPRK3) time integrator.

The method alternates between\nsolving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the\ncontrols via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation.\nUnder standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the\nvalue function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity\nsolution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz\nregularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without\nrequiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\naccuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic\npath-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference\nbenchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and\nten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise,\nthe proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding\nsmoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that\nintegrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically\ngrounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with\npotential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning."}
