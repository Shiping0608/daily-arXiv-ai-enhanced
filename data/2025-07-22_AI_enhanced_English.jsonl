It has recently been demonstrated\nthat any short immersion from an $n$-dimensional smooth compact manifold into\n$2n$-dimensional Euclidean space can be uniformly approximated by\n$C^{1,\\theta}$ isometric immersions with any $\\theta\\in(0,1/(n+2))$ in\ndimensions $n\\geq3$. In this paper, we improve the H\\\"{o}lder regularity of the\nconstructed isometric immersions in the local setting, achieving $C^{1,\\theta}$\nfor all $\\theta\\in(0,1/n)$ in odd dimensions and all $\\theta\\in(0,1/(n+1))$ in\neven dimensions. Moreover, we also establish explicit $C^{1}$ estimates for the\nisometric immersions, which indicate that the larger the initial metric error\nis, the greater the $C^{1}$ norms of the resulting isometric maps become,\nmeaning that their slope become steeper.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper improves the H\u00f6lder regularity of isometric immersions of Riemannian manifolds in high codimensions, achieving better results for odd and even dimensions, and provides explicit C\u00b9 estimates.", "motivation": "To enhance the understanding and construction of isometric immersions by improving their regularity and providing quantitative estimates.", "method": "The study focuses on refining the H\u00f6lder regularity of isometric immersions, distinguishing between odd and even dimensions, and deriving explicit C\u00b9 estimates.", "result": "Improved regularity: C\u00b9,\u03b8 for \u03b8\u2208(0,1/n) in odd dimensions and \u03b8\u2208(0,1/(n+1)) in even dimensions.
