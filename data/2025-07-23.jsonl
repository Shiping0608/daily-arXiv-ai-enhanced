Trained\non paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with\n\\texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the\nintergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc\npressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest. The model\nachieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical\ndepth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\\% in the large-scale flux power\nspectrum (\\(k < 3 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s/km}\\)), and less than 10\\% error in\nthe flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model\nreduces the compute time by a factor of $\\sim$450 compared to full smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the\npotential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating\nhigh-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets\nfor next-generation cosmological surveys."}

The proposed framework characterizes the optimal structure through\nan order parameter function, analogous to phase-field models in materials\nscience, where the design domain and its boundary are intrinsically represented\nby the order parameter function. The topology optimization problem is\nreformulated as a constrained minimization problem with respect to this order\nparameter, requiring simultaneous satisfaction of three critical properties:\nbound preservation, volume conservation, and monotonic objective functional\ndecay throughout the optimization process. The principal mathematical challenge\narises from handling domain-dependent body forces, which necessitates the\ndevelopment of a constrained optimization framework. To address this, we\ndevelop an operator-splitting algorithm incorporating Lagrange multipliers,\nenhanced by a novel limiter mechanism. This hybrid approach guarantees strict\nbound preservation, exact volume conservation, and correct objective functional\ndecaying rate. Numerical implementation demonstrates the scheme's robustness\nthrough comprehensive 2D and 3D benchmarks."}
