This paper introduces ddfem, an\nextensible Python package to provide a framework for transforming PDEs into a\nDiffuse Domain formulation.

Recent breakthroughs show that dense\nrelativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil\nwith a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic\nelectron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a\ncounter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet\nwith efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of\nmagnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can\nreliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated\n\\emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of\nthe back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning\nparameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and\nbandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering (TBS) pulse.\nTogether, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for\ncompact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast\nphenomena."}

Here, we focus on assessing several\nsources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum\ndynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the\ncomputationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the\nrestricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by\nTDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench\nstrength.
