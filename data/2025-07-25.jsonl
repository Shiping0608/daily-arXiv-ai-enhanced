The algorithm, based on the\nrecently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave\nequation as part of an iteration. At each iteration, the solution to the wave\nequation is filtered in time. As the iteration progresses, the filtered\nsolution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of\neigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target\neigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the\ncomputation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert\nan indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches. Furthermore, the\niteration can be embedded within a matrix-free Arnoldi algorithm, which enables\nthe efficient computation of multiple eigenpairs near the target frequency. For\nefficiency, the time-dependent wave equation can be solved with implicit\ntime-stepping and only about $10$ time-steps per-period are needed, independent\nof the mesh spacing. When the (definite) implicit time-stepping equations are\nsolved with a multigrid algorithm, the cost of the resulting EigenWave scheme\nscales linearly with the number of grid points $N$ as the mesh is refined,\ngiving an optimal $O(N)$ algorithm.

Neural operators (NOs), a class of deep learning\nmodels, have emerged as a promising alternative by learning mappings between\nfunction spaces and efficiently approximating solution operators. In this work,\nwe introduce the Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO), an extended neural operator\nframework specifically designed to address the temporal challenges associated\nwith solving time-dependent PDEs. Unlike existing neural operators, which\neither struggle with error accumulation or require substantial computational\nresources for high-dimensional tensor representations, MHNO employs a novel\narchitecture with time-step-specific projection operators and explicit temporal\nconnections inspired by message-passing mechanisms. This design allows MHNO to\npredict all time steps after a single forward pass, while effectively capturing\nlong-term dependencies and avoiding parameter overgrowth. We apply MHNO to\nsolve various phase field equations, including antiphase boundary motion,\nspinodal decomposition, pattern formation, atomic scale modeling, and molecular\nbeam epitaxy growth model, and compare its performance with existing NO-based\nmethods.

Hamiltonian mechanics, rooted in\nsymplectic and Poisson geometry, has long provided a foundation for modelling\nconservative systems in classical physics. Jacobi manifolds, generalizing both\ncontact and Poisson manifolds, extend this theory and are suitable for\nincorporating time-dependent, dissipative and thermodynamic phenomena.\n  Building on recent advances in geometric integrators - specifically Poisson\nHamiltonian Integrators (PHI), which preserve key features of Poisson systems -\nwe propose a construction of Jacobi Hamiltonian Integrators. Our approach\nexplores the correspondence between Jacobi and homogeneous Poisson manifolds,\nwith the aim of extending the PHI techniques while ensuring preservation of the\nhomogeneity structure.\n  This work develops the theoretical tools required for this generalization and\noutlines a numerical integration technique compatible with Jacobi dynamics. By\nfocusing on the homogeneous Poisson perspective rather than on direct contact\nrealizations, we provide a clear pathway for structure-preserving integration\nof time-dependent and dissipative systems within the Jacobi framework."}
