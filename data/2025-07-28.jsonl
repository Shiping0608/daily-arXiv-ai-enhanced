The Brinkman model, which mathematically blends\nfeatures of both the Stokes and Darcy equations, describes fluid flow in\nmulti-physics environments, particularly in heterogeneous porous media\ncharacterized by spatially varying permeability. In such settings, flow\nbehavior may be governed predominantly by Darcy dynamics in certain regions and\nby Stokes dynamics in others. A central difficulty in this context arises from\nthe incompatibility of standard finite element spaces: elements stable for the\nStokes equations typically perform poorly for Darcy flows, and vice versa. The\nprimary challenge addressed in this study is the development of a unified\nnumerical scheme that maintains stability and accuracy across both flow\nregimes. To this end, the proposed WG method demonstrates a robust capacity to\nresolve both Stokes- and Darcy-dominated flows through a unified framework. The\nmethod supports general finite element partitions consisting of convex and\nnon-convex polytopal elements, and employs bubble functions as a critical\nanalytical component to achieve stability and convergence.

We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C\nsystem by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD\nrealization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on\nspin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments\nreveals a striking dichotomy.

Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters\nare captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM\nfails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state:\nat high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so\ntheir explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential\nfor equilibrium volumes.
