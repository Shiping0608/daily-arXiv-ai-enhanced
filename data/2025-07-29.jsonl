This study presents a systematic comparison using\nconstrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis\nEngine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were\nperformed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and\noperational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering\nconstraints including 250 $\\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding\nratio $>$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both\nconfigurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through\ncontrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal\ndegradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger\nmachines ($R_0$ $>$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H\nthreshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit\n($P_{sol}/R$ $<$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively\nreduced magnetic field ($\\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from\nthese constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \\sim 5.5$ m,\n$B_0$ $>$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology.\nSensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on\nuncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a\n50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the\ncompact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be\nrisk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can\nbe confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints\nand physics uncertainties."}

Negative triangularity geometry is\nmore susceptible to micro-tearing modes (MTM), which, when present, make\ntransport much worse than in positive triangularity. At sufficiently large\n$\\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure over magnetic pressure), magnetic shear\nand ratio of electron to ion temperature gradient, all the scenarios with\nnegative triangularity are dominated by MTM turbulence.

Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics.

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these\nbottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a\nbalance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical\nstability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

This family\nincludes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition,\nconsisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also\nagrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition,\nwhere one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary,\nalready covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.\n  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary\nconditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal\nEinstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a\nspinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham\nexpansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics.
