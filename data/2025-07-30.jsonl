The\nspline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form\nwhich are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.\nThis gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the\nODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers\nODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without\nusing any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy\ndata and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real\nexperimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena."}

We propose the\nquantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap\nthrough transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in\nhigher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to\nachieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a\nhierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized\nembedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase\ncomponents, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators\nthat act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from\ndiagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed\nfor efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables\ndirect multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity\nscales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is\nvalidated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative\nerrors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key\nstatistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for\nquantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework\nbuilt on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum\nalgorithms for unitary dynamics evolution."}
