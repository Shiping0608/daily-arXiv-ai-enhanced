At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly\nsingular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This\nnear-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear\nelasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular\nsystem is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by\nadding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution\nwhile ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur\ncomplement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the\npreconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh\nsize and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are\nconsidered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The\nefficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective\niterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES\nachieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement\npreconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient\nsolvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be\nreformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure\nvariable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy\nextends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also\nshow parameter-free convergence for the regularized system. Numerical\nexperiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the\nregularization strategy and the robustness of the block preconditioners."}

With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have\nimplemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use\nin the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll\nframework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time\nintegrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time\nstep in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes.

Determining potential distributions requires solving two\nPoisson equations that are nonlinearly coupled through Butler-Volmer kinetics\nunder galvanostatic and potentiostatic operating modes. Under galvanostatic\noperation, these equations form an underconstrained singular system due to\nall-Neumann boundary conditions, posing numerical challenges. This paper\nsystematically presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled\nPoisson equations in dual-continuum porous electrodes, with a particular focus\non galvanostatic solutions. We mathematically establish solution uniqueness in\nterms of the potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte (or\noverpotential), as well as the individual potentials up to a shared constant\nshift. To resolve the nonuniqueness of the solution, we introduce three\nnumerical approaches: (1) Lagrange Constrained Method (LCM), (2) Dirichlet\nSubstitution Method (DSM), and (3) Global Constraining Method (GCM), where GCM\nenables solving the overpotential without imposing an explicit system reference\npotential. Additionally, we develop both decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear\nsolution strategies and evaluate their computational performance in both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous conductivity cases. The presented numerical\nmethods are general for addressing similar underconstrained nonlinear systems.\nA Python implementation is provided at\nhttps://github.com/harrywang1129/porous_electrode_solver."}

However, recent systems predominantly\nexhibit dual degenerate polarization states with weak intensity, hindering the\noptimal manipulations of photovoltaic effects through sliding ferroelectricity.\nHere, we address this limitation by introducing two strengthened and distinct\nnon-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se,\nwhich can be achieved by Se-to-S substitution in monolayer In2Se3.\nFirst-principles calculations validate the experimental synthesis of this\nstructure and its capability for reversible phase transitions triggered by\natomic layer sliding, and a series of superior photovoltaic performances are\ndemonstrated in such unique Janus In2S2Se, accompanied by a detailed analysis\nof how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity modulates distinct photovoltaic\ncharacteristics. The WZ' to ZB' transition can increase the carrier mobility\nand moderate the band gap while inducing an indirect-to-direct transition,\nyielding a marked red-shift and enhancement of the photocurrent peak in the\ninfrared spectrum. Conversely, the WZ' phase, benefiting from enhanced\npolarization, delivers superior photoelectric conversion efficiency in the\nvisible light region. This work establishes a phase-engineered framework of how\nnon-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity orchestrates distinct photovoltaic\nbehaviors, and the intrinsic physical correlations may offer novel perspectives\nfor designing and regulating innovative photovoltaic devices."}
