### [1] [An inherent regularization approach to parameter-free preconditioning for nearly incompressible linear poroelasticity and elasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22334)
*Weizhang Huang,Zhuoran Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inherent regularization strategy and block Schur complement preconditioning for solving linear poroelasticity problems, ensuring efficient iterative solutions independent of mesh size and locking parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the near-singularity issue in saddle point systems arising from linear poroelasticity problems, particularly in the locking regime where the solid is nearly incompressible.

Method: The system is reformulated as a saddle point problem and regularized by modifying the (2,2) block. Block Schur complement preconditioning is applied, leveraging efficient solvers for linear elasticity. Two- and three-field formulations are considered.

Result: Preconditioned MINRES and GMRES achieve parameter-free convergence, confirmed by numerical experiments in 2D and 3D.

Conclusion: The regularization strategy and block preconditioners are robust and effective for solving linear poroelasticity problems, even in challenging regimes.

Abstract: An inherent regularization strategy and block Schur complement
preconditioning are studied for linear poroelasticity problems discretized
using the lowest-order weak Galerkin FEM in space and the implicit Euler scheme
in time. At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly
singular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This
near-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear
elasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular
system is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by
adding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution
while ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur
complement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the
preconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh
size and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are
considered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The
efficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective
iterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES
achieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement
preconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient
solvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be
reformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure
variable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy
extends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also
show parameter-free convergence for the regularized system. Numerical
experiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the
regularization strategy and the robustness of the block preconditioners.

### [2] [Pulsatile Flows for Simplified Smart Fluids with Variable Power-Law: Analysis and Numerics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22449)
*Luigi C. Berselli,Alex Kaltenbach*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Existence of time-periodic solutions for a generalized non-Newtonian fluid model with variable exponent rheology, validated numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize results for Navier-Stokes and p-fluid equations by studying shear-dependent non-Newtonian fluids with position-dependent power-law indices.

Method: Variational solutions via fully-discrete finite-differences/-elements discretization, unifying treatment for all exponent values.

Result: Proven existence of time-periodic solutions for assigned flow-rate or pressure-drop, with explicit benchmark solutions for smart fluids.

Conclusion: The approach provides new insights even for constant exponent cases, supported by numerical validation.

Abstract: We study the fully-developed, time-periodic motion of a shear-dependent
non-Newtonian fluid with variable exponent rheology through an infinite pipe
$\Omega:= \mathbb{R}\times \Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \{2,3\}$, of
arbitrary cross-section $\Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The focus is on a
generalized $p(\cdot)$-fluid model, where the power-law index is
position-dependent (with respect to $\Sigma$), $\textit{i.e.}$, a function
$p\colon \Sigma\to (1,+\infty)$. We prove the existence of time-periodic
solutions with either assigned time-periodic flow-rate or pressure-drop,
generalizing known results for the Navier-Stokes and for $p$-fluid equations.
  In addition, we identify explicit solutions, relevant as benchmark cases,
especially for electro-rheological fluids or, more generally, $\textit{`smart
fluids'}$. To support practical applications, we present a fully-constructive
existence proof for variational solutions by means of a fully-discrete
finite-differences/-elements discretization, consistent with our numerical
experiments. Our approach, which unifies the treatment of all values of
$p(\overline{x})\in (1,+\infty)$, $\overline{x}\in \Sigma$, without requiring
an auxiliary Newtonian term, provides new insights even in the constant
exponent case. The theoretical findings are reviewed by means of numerical
experiments.

### [3] [A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22539)
*Matteo Giacomini,Antonio Huerta*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A surrogate-based topology optimization method for linear elastic structures under parametric loads, using a feed-forward net to predict quasi-optimal topologies and refine them efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost and improve efficiency in topology optimization by leveraging surrogate models.

Method: Uses a feed-forward net to map input parameters to a latent space, predicts quasi-optimal topologies, and refines them with a penalization algorithm.

Result: Reduces optimization iterations by 53% with discrepancies below 4% in objective functional, even beyond training data.

Conclusion: The method efficiently produces accurate topologies, outperforming high-fidelity optimizers while maintaining consistency with physics.

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic
structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead
of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the
optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach
devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the
method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a
surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation
method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping
between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space
determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the
parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional
representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an
educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the
intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing
equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential
errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the
design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics.
Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation
capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The
quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by
reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while
achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective
functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to
extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

### [4] [A Structure-Preserving Rational Integrator for the Replicator Dynamics on the Probability Simplex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22609)
*Mario Pezzella*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A quadratically convergent, dynamically consistent integrator for replicator dynamics is introduced, ensuring properties like non-negativity and second-order accuracy, validated by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust numerical integrator for replicator dynamics that preserves key properties (e.g., non-negativity, equilibria) and achieves high accuracy.

Method: Combines a two-stage rational approximation with normalization, includes adaptive time-stepping via an embedded auxiliary method, and ensures a discrete quotient rule.

Result: The scheme is second-order accurate, preserves invariants, and outperforms existing solvers in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed integrator is effective for replicator dynamics, combining theoretical guarantees with practical performance.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quadratically convergent and dynamically
consistent integrator specifically designed for the replicator dynamics. The
proposed scheme combines a two-stage rational approximation with a
normalization step to ensure confinement to the probability simplex and
unconditional preservation of non-negativity, invariant sets and equilibria. A
rigorous convergence analysis is provided to establish the scheme's
second-order accuracy, and an embedded auxiliary method is devised for adaptive
time-stepping based on local error estimation. Furthermore, a discrete analogue
of the quotient rule, which governs the evolution of component ratios, is shown
to hold. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, illustrating
the method's ability to reproduce complex dynamics and to outperform
well-established solvers in particularly challenging scenarios.

### [5] [Tropical solution of discrete best approximation problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22634)
*Nikolai Krivulin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses tropical algebra best approximation problems by transforming them into vector equations and solving them with an alternating algorithm involving optimization and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to approximate unknown functions in tropical semifields using rational functions, addressing the challenge of fitting data with tropical distance metrics.

Method: The method involves transforming the problem into vector equations, alternately fixing one side, and using optimization and agglomerative clustering to minimize error.

Result: The algorithm converges in finite steps and provides reasonable solutions, demonstrated with max-plus algebra examples.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively solves tropical approximation problems, offering practical solutions for piecewise linear function approximation.

Abstract: We consider discrete best approximation problems in the setting of tropical
algebra that is concerned with the theory and application of algebraic systems
with idempotent operations. Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown
function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an
approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator
and denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the
approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial
in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a
tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into
approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where
one side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the
denominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown
exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials. We
propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by
alternately fixing one side of the equation to an already found result and
leaving the other intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect
to the vector of coefficients, which yields a vector of coefficients and
approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. The exponents are
found by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on
agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for
approximation problems in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with
addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which
correspond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real
functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges
in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonable solution to the problems
considered.

*Lehel Banjai,Emmanuil H. Georgoulis,Brian Hennessy*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new conforming space-time Galerkin method for semi-linear wave equations is introduced, proven well-posed and unconditionally stable, with a priori error bounds and numerical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable and well-posed discretisation method for semi-linear wave equations using De Giorgi's elliptic regularisation.

Method: Space-time Galerkin discretisation based on a variational formulation from De Giorgi's elliptic regularisation.

Result: The method is well-posed, unconditionally stable, and has proven a priori error bounds. Numerical experiments validate the theory.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for semi-linear wave equations, with strong theoretical and numerical support.

Abstract: We present and analyse a new conforming space-time Galerkin discretisation of
a semi-linear wave equation, based on a variational formulation derived from De
Giorgi's elliptic regularisation viewpoint of the wave equation in second-order
formulation. The method is shown to be well-posed through a minimisation
approach, and also unconditionally stable for all choices of conforming
discretisation spaces. Further, a priori error bounds are proven for
sufficiently smooth solutions. Special attention is given to the conditioning
of the method and its stable implementation. Numerical experiments are provided
to validate the theoretical findings.

### [7] [Helmholtz boundary integral methods and the pollution effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22797)
*Jeffrey Galkowski,Manas Rachh,Euan A. Spence*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes methods for solving Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$, focusing on boundary integral equations (BIEs) and their accuracy as $k$ grows. It examines Galerkin, collocation, and Nyström methods, identifying conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality and pollution effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the dimension $N$ of approximation spaces must scale with $k$ to maintain accuracy in solving Helmholtz problems, and to identify pollution effects in certain methods.

Method: The study uses Galerkin, collocation, and Nyström methods with piecewise or trigonometric polynomials. It analyzes $k$-uniform quasi-optimality and pollution effects, particularly for the ball and trapping domains.

Result: For piecewise-polynomial methods, $N$ must grow faster than $k^{d-1}$ to avoid pollution. Trigonometric polynomial methods avoid pollution, even for trapping obstacles.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first $k$-explicit convergence results for collocation and Nyström methods for Dirichlet BIEs and any method for Neumann BIEs, highlighting pollution effects in certain cases.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and
Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$ and smooth obstacles using the
standard second-kind boundary integral equations (BIEs) for these problems. We
consider Galerkin and collocation methods - with subspaces consisting of
$\textit{either}$ piecewise polynomials (in 2-d for collocation, in any
dimension for Galerkin) $\textit{or}$ trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d) - as
well as a fully discrete quadrature (a.k.a., Nystr\"om) method based on
trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d).
  For each of these methods, we address the fundamental question: how quickly
must $N$, the dimension of the approximation space, grow with $k$ to maintain
accuracy as $k\to\infty$? For the methods involving piecewise-polynomials, we
give sufficient conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Galerkin
method we prove that these are, in fact, necessary and sufficient. In
particular, we prove that, when applied to the Neumann BIEs when the obstacle
is a ball, the Galerkin method $\textit{suffers from the pollution effect}$;
i.e., $N$ growing like $k^{d-1}$ is not sufficient for $k$-uniform
quasi-optimality. For the Dirichlet BIEs, we prove that pollution occurs for
the ball for certain choices of coupling parameter, and we give numerical
experiments illustrating pollution for trapping domains with the standard
coupling parameter. For all the methods involving trigonometric polynomials, we
show that, up to potential factors of $k^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon>0$,
these methods do not suffer from the pollution effect (even for trapping
obstacles).
  These are the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of collocation or
Nystr\"om methods applied to the Dirichlet BIEs, and the first results about
$k$-explicit convergence of any method used to solve the standard second-kind
Neumann BIEs.

### [8] [Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinearly Coupled Poisson Equations in Dual-Continuum Modeled Porous Electrodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22818)
*Yuhe Wang,Min Wang,Zhihang Xu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled Poisson equations in porous electrodes, focusing on galvanostatic operation, and introduces three approaches to resolve solution nonuniqueness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate determination of electric potentials in porous electrodes is crucial for understanding electrode behavior, but numerical challenges arise due to underconstrained systems under galvanostatic operation.

Method: The paper introduces three numerical methods (LCM, DSM, GCM) to resolve nonuniqueness in solving coupled Poisson equations, along with decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear solution strategies.

Result: The methods uniquely determine potential differences and individual potentials (up to a constant shift) and are evaluated for computational performance in homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

Conclusion: The proposed numerical approaches are generalizable for underconstrained nonlinear systems, with a Python implementation provided for practical use.

Abstract: Porous electrodes are widely used in electrochemical systems, where
accurately determining electric potentials, particularly overpotentials, is
essential for understanding electrode behavior. At the macroscopic scale,
porous electrodes are typically modeled using a dual-continuum approach,
treating the porous solid phase and the liquid electrolyte as spatially
superimposed domains. Determining potential distributions requires solving two
Poisson equations that are nonlinearly coupled through Butler-Volmer kinetics
under galvanostatic and potentiostatic operating modes. Under galvanostatic
operation, these equations form an underconstrained singular system due to
all-Neumann boundary conditions, posing numerical challenges. This paper
systematically presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled
Poisson equations in dual-continuum porous electrodes, with a particular focus
on galvanostatic solutions. We mathematically establish solution uniqueness in
terms of the potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte (or
overpotential), as well as the individual potentials up to a shared constant
shift. To resolve the nonuniqueness of the solution, we introduce three
numerical approaches: (1) Lagrange Constrained Method (LCM), (2) Dirichlet
Substitution Method (DSM), and (3) Global Constraining Method (GCM), where GCM
enables solving the overpotential without imposing an explicit system reference
potential. Additionally, we develop both decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear
solution strategies and evaluate their computational performance in both
homogeneous and heterogeneous conductivity cases. The presented numerical
methods are general for addressing similar underconstrained nonlinear systems.

### [9] [Dynamic analysis of free-free Timoshenko beams on elastic foundation under transverse transient ground deformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22850)
*Gersena Banushi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new semi-analytical model for analyzing the dynamic response of buried beams to transient ground deformation (TGD) is developed, validated, and compared with finite element analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current design methods oversimplify soil movement, neglecting inertia and soil-structure interaction, which is inadequate for large pipelines and tunnels.

Method: Develops a semi-analytical model based on Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory, validated with case studies and finite element analysis.

Result: The model identifies four vibration spectrum parts with dynamic amplification near fundamental frequencies, matching seismic wave ranges.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust framework for understanding and analyzing buried beam behavior under ground vibration.

Abstract: Underground infrastructure, such as pipelines and tunnels, can be vulnerable
to the effect of transient ground deformation (TGD) caused by different
vibration sources, including earthquakes and traffic loads. Current design
methods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement
as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system's inertia and the
relative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption
may not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring
accurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight
beam subjected to transverse TGD, this study develops a new semi-analytical
model based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The
closed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided
in four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each
transition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes
change, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify
the validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a
buried steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions,
subjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions
with the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the
two approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification
of the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's
fundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies
characterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis. The proposed
methodology provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the primary
factors impacting the dynamic behavior of buried beams, giving a deeper
understanding of the system response under various sources of ground vibration.

### [10] [Numerical Fredholm determinants for matrix-valued kernels on the real line](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22875)
*Erika Gallo,John Zweck,Yuri Latushkin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents a numerical method for approximating Fredholm determinants of matrix-valued kernels on the real line, extending prior work on scalar kernels. It includes error estimates and numerical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the analysis of Fredholm determinants to matrix-valued kernels on the real line, addressing limitations of prior methods focused on scalar kernels and finite intervals.

Method: Approximates the Fredholm determinant by truncating the kernel to a finite interval and applying a quadrature rule, with error estimates for truncation and quadrature.

Result: Derived truncation and quadrature error estimates, validated numerically for a Birman-Schwinger operator in nonlinear wave equations.

Conclusion: The method effectively extends prior work to matrix-valued kernels on the real line, with practical applicability demonstrated.

Abstract: We analyze a numerical method for computing Fredholm determinants of trace
class and Hilbert Schmidt integral operators defined in terms of matrix-valued
kernels on the entire real line. With this method, the Fredholm determinant is
approximated by the determinant of a matrix constructed by truncating the
kernel of the operator to a finite interval and then applying a quadrature
rule. Under the assumption that the kernel decays exponentially, we derive an
estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of the operator on the real line to
that of its truncation to a finite interval. Then we derive a quadrature error
estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of a matrix-valued kernel on a
finite interval to its numerical approximation obtained via an adaptive
composite Simpson's quadrature rule. These results extend the analysis of
Bornemann which focused on Fredholm determinants of trace class operators
defined by scalar-valued kernels on a finite interval. Numerical results are
provided for a Birman-Schwinger operator that characterizes the stability of
stationary solutions of nonlinear wave equations.

### [11] [Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22072)
*Roberto Alessi,Francesco Colasanto,Matteo Focardi*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper completes a three-part series on phase-field modeling for cohesive fracture, focusing on mechanical responses of novel models in a 1D framework and exploring identical fracture outcomes from distinct models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture and connect theoretical insights to practical applications.

Method: Builds on prior theoretical work, analyzing mechanical responses of phase-field models in a one-dimensional setting, emphasizing identical cohesive fracture results from different models.

Result: Demonstrates that distinct phase-field models can yield identical cohesive fracture responses, providing practical interpretations of theoretical frameworks.

Conclusion: The study bridges theory and application, showing how varied phase-field models can achieve the same fracture behavior, enhancing practical modeling flexibility.

Abstract: This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and
unified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building
on the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which
included a $\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy
functionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for
constructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper
explores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are
novel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a
one-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of
formulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different
evolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical
cohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical
interpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical
insights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications.

### [12] [Estimates for harmonic functions near pseudo-corners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22178)
*Martin Costabel,Monique Dauge*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies the blow-up of Sobolev norms in solutions to elliptic boundary value problems near domain corners, using the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions as an example. It provides explicit estimates for norms and singularity coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the blow-up of higher-order Sobolev norms when approximating domains with conical singularities using smoother domains.

Method: Uses an inner expansion derived from generalized power series to analyze the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two scenarios: rounding a corner and replacing a polygonal corner with smaller angles.

Result: Derives simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and singularity coefficients, scaling with the approximation parameter.

Conclusion: The inner expansion method effectively quantifies the blow-up behavior, providing useful estimates for practical applications.

Abstract: It is well known that derivatives of solutions to elliptic boundary value
problems may become unbounded near the corner of a domain with a conical
singularity, even if the data are smooth. When the corner domain is
approximated by more regular domains, then higher order Sobolev norms of the
solutions on these domains can blow up in the limit. We study this blow-up in
the simple example of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two
situations: The rounding of a corner in any dimension, and the two-dimensional
situation where a polygonal corner is replaced by two or more corners with
smaller angles. We show how an inner expansion derived from a more general
recent result on converging expansions into generalized power series can be
employed to prove simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and
singularity coefficients by powers of the approximation scale.

*Jingeon An,Hardy Chan,Pak Tung Ho*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper extends the convergence of fractional Yamabe flow to arbitrary initial energy, assuming the fractional positive mass conjecture holds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of previous results requiring small initial energy for fractional Yamabe flow convergence.

Method: Inspired by Brendle's work, the authors analyze the fractional Yamabe flow under the fractional positive mass conjecture.

Result: Full convergence of the fractional Yamabe flow is achieved for arbitrary initial energy, contingent on the fractional positive mass conjecture.

Conclusion: The study generalizes previous results, removing the small initial energy constraint, provided the fractional positive mass conjecture is valid.

Abstract: Since the seminal paper of Graham and Zworski (Invent. Math. 2003), conformal
geometric problems are studied in the fractional setting. We consider the
convergence of fractional Yamabe flow, which is previously known under small
initial energy assumption. Inspired by the deep work of Brendle (J. Diff. Geom.
2005), we obtain the full convergence result for arbitrary initial energy,
whenever the (fractional) positive mass conjecture is valid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the topological properties (connectedness, compactness) of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations with damping, and their dependence on the damping parameter β.

Method: Analyze weak and strong solutions in phase space, focusing on weak/strong topology based on β. Prove global attractor's connectedness and regularity.

Result: Established results on connectedness/compactness of attainability sets. Proved global attractor's connectedness in strong topology and provided regularity insights.

Conclusion: The study clarifies topological properties of solutions and global attractor, with implications for understanding Navier-Stokes dynamics under damping.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the connectedness and compactness of the
attainability set of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes
equations with damping. Depending on the value of the parameter \b{eta}, which
controls the damping term, we establish these results with respect to either
the weak or the strong topology of the phase space. In the latter case, we also
prove that the global attractor is connected. Additionally, we establish
results concerning the regularity of the global attractor and provide a new
proof of its existence for strong solutions.

*Isabeau Birindelli,Françoise Demengel,Fabiana Leoni*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies equations with truncated Laplacians and singular potentials in punctured balls, focusing on eigenvalue problems and solution classification based on behavior near the origin. Results for the maximising truncated Laplacian resemble those for the Laplacian in dimension k, while the minimising operator yields significantly different outcomes due to its degeneracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of solutions to equations involving truncated Laplacians with singular potentials, particularly near the origin, and to compare the effects of maximising and minimising operators.

Method: Analyzes the principal eigenvalue problem and classifies solutions based on asymptotic behavior near the origin, considering superlinear absorbing lower order terms.

Result: For the maximising truncated Laplacian, results are similar to the Laplacian in dimension k. For the minimising operator, the strong degeneracy leads to radically different outcomes.

Conclusion: The degeneracy of the minimising operator significantly alters solution behavior, while the maximising operator behaves analogously to the classical Laplacian.

Abstract: We consider equations involving the truncated laplacians and having lower
order terms with singular potentials posed in punctured balls. We study both
the principal eigenvalue problem and the problem of classification of
solutions, in dependence of their asymptotic behaviour near the origin, for
equations having also superlinear absorbing lower order terms. In the case of
the maximising truncated Laplacian "Pk+", owing to the mild degeneracy of the
operator, we obtain results which are analogous to the results for the
Laplacian in dimension k. On the other hand, for minimising operator "Pk-" we
show that the strong degeneracy in ellipticity of the operator produces
radically different results.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the existence of solutions for the given equation on lattice graphs using variational methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the fractional $p$-Laplacian Choquard equation $$
(-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u+h(x)|u|^{p-2} u=\left(R_{\alpha} *F(u)\right)f(u) $$ on
lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where $s\in(0,1)$, $ p\geq 2$, $\alpha \in(0,
d)$ and $R_\alpha$ represents the Green's function of the discrete fractional
Laplacian that behaves as the Riesz potential. Under suitable assumptions on
the potential function $h$, we first prove the existence of a strictly positive
solution by the mountain-pass theorem for the nonlinearity $f$ satisfying some
growth conditions. Moreover, if we add some monotonicity condition, we
establish the existence of a positive ground state solution by the method of
Nehari manifold.

*Julian Blawid,Georg Dolzmann*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes regularity properties of solutions for quasi-stationary models of stress-modulated growth in one dimension, incorporating nutrient fields and elastic deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between growth, nutrient fields, and elastic stress in biological systems, and to establish mathematical regularity for such models.

Method: Uses ordinary differential equations for growth, hyperelastic variational integrals for deformation, and reaction-diffusion equations for nutrient concentration.

Result: Proves regularity properties of solutions, showing how growth, stress, and nutrient fields interact mathematically.

Conclusion: The model provides a rigorous framework for studying stress-modulated growth with nutrient dependence, with proven regularity for solutions.

Abstract: Regularity properties of solutions for a class of quasi-stationary models in
one spatial dimension for stress-modulated growth in the presence of a nutrient
field are proven. At a given point in time the configuration of a body after
pure growth is determined by means of a family of ordinary differential
equations in every point in space. Subsequently, an elastic deformation, which
is given by the minimizer of a hyperelastic variational integral, is applied in
order to restore Dirichlet boundary conditions. While the ordinary differential
equations governing the growth process depend on the elastic stress and the
pullback of a nutrient concentration in the current configuration, the
hyperelastic variational problem is solved on the intermediate configuration
after pure growth. Additionally, the coefficients of the reaction-diffusion
equation determining the nutrient concentration in the current configuration
depend on the elastic deformation and the deformation due to pure growth.

Motivation: To analyze solutions of parabolic systems with weighted coefficients and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, aiming to generalize Schauder estimates and Harnack principles for degenerate/singular cases.

Method: Study solutions in the upper-half cylinder with coefficients weighted by $x_n^\alpha$, assuming partially Dini mean oscillation.

Result: Higher-order boundary Schauder estimates for $x_n^\alpha u$ and boundary Harnack principles for degenerate/singular equations with Hölder coefficients.

*Ali Feizmohammadi,Katya Krupchyk*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of inverse spectral problems on closed Riemannian manifolds, focusing on recovering potentials from partial spectral data without requiring orthogonal eigenfunctions or global norming constants. It extends inverse spectral theory to passive imaging with incomplete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by inverse problems with single passive measurements, aiming to address scenarios where only limited observational access to solutions is available.

Method: The authors establish uniqueness results for recovering potentials in the stationary Schrödinger operator using partial spectral data (eigenvalues and restricted eigenfunctions). The framework is applied to evolutionary PDEs for recovering coefficients and initial/source data.

Result: Generic uniqueness results are proven for a broad class of evolutionary PDEs, demonstrating the feasibility of recovery from highly incomplete but realistic data.

Conclusion: The work introduces a spectral framework for passive imaging and extends inverse spectral theory to scenarios with incomplete data, offering practical applications in passive measurement settings.

Abstract: Motivated by inverse problems with a single passive measurement, we introduce
and analyze a new class of inverse spectral problems on closed Riemannian
manifolds. Specifically, we establish two general uniqueness results for the
recovery of a potential in the stationary Schr\"odinger operator from partial
spectral data, which consists of a possibly sparse subset of its eigenvalues
and the restrictions of the corresponding eigenfunctions to a nonempty open
subset of the manifold. Crucially, the eigenfunctions are not assumed to be
orthogonal, and no information about global norming constants is required.
  The partial data formulation of our inverse spectral problems is naturally
suited to the analysis of inverse problems with passive measurements, where
only limited observational access to the solution is available. Leveraging this
structure, we establish generic uniqueness results for a broad class of
evolutionary PDEs, in which both the coefficients and the initial or source
data are to be recovered from knowledge of the solution restricted to a subset
of spacetime. These results introduce a spectral framework for passive imaging
and extend inverse spectral theory into a regime characterized by highly
incomplete, yet physically realistic, data.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper examines the prevalence of existence and uniqueness of solutions for vector fields in $L^1_t L^q_x$, showing existence is rare (meager) while uniqueness is generic. It also proves that non-uniqueness counterexamples are dense in their ambient space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generic behavior of solutions to the continuity equation and ODEs, particularly focusing on the rarity of existence and commonality of uniqueness, while also exploring the density of non-uniqueness cases.

Method: Analyzes vector fields in $L^1_t L^q_x$ to study the Baire category properties of existence and uniqueness of solutions. Constructs dense counterexamples to uniqueness for continuity equations and ODEs.

Result: Existence of solutions is meager (rare), while uniqueness is generic (common). Non-uniqueness counterexamples are dense in their natural space.

Conclusion: Uniqueness is a generic property for solutions, but dense counterexamples to uniqueness exist, highlighting the nuanced behavior of these systems.

Abstract: These notes address two problems. First, we investigate the question of ``how
many'' are (in Baire sense) vector fields in $L^1_t L^q_x$, $q \in [1,
\infty)$, for which existence and/or uniqueness of local, distributional
solutions to the associated continuity equation holds. We show that, in certain
regimes, existence of solutions (even locally in time, for at least one nonzero
initial datum) is a meager property, whereas, on the contrary, uniqueness of
solutions is a generic property. Secondly, despite the fact that non-uniqueness
is a meager property, we prove that (Sobolev) counterexamples to uniqueness,
both for the continuity equation and for the ODE, in the spirit of [Bru\`e,
Colombo, Kumar 2024] and [Kumar 2024] respectively, form a dense subset of the
natural ambient space they live in.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of disparate time scales in unsteady conjugate heat transfer simulations and improve computational efficiency.

Method: Couples a global temperature field representation (using eigenfunctions) with a local fine-scale solution at the conjugate interface, leveraging decoupled modal equations for targeted acceleration.

Result: Validated in 1D analyses and scale-resolving simulations, showing up to fourfold reduction in computational time for steady thermal conditions.

Conclusion: The method provides an accurate and accelerated framework for unsteady thermal analysis, balancing efficiency and precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale methodology for efficient unsteady conjugate
heat transfer simulations.
  The solid domain is modelled by coupling a global representation of the
temperature field, based on the eigenfunctions of the unsteady heat conduction
equation, with a local, fine-scale-resolving solution of the heat conduction
equation at the conjugate interface.
  To address the disparate time scales and enhance convergence, the decoupled
modal equations are leveraged to enable targeted acceleration of the longest
thermal time scales.
  One-dimensional analyses validate the properties of the scheme, while
scale-resolving simulations demonstrate its practical application for steady
and unsteady problems. Notably, the method achieves up to a fourfold reduction
in computational time to reach steady thermal conditions compared to
conventional conjugate simulations, without introducing significant
computational overhead or error, offering an accurate and accelerated framework

### [24] [Axisymmetric Gyrokinetic Simulation of ASDEX-Upgrade Scrape-off Layer Using a Conservative Implicit BGK Collision Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22821)
*D. Liu,J. Juno,G. W. Hammett,A. Hakim,A. Shukla,M. Francisquez*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an implicit BGK collision operator in the Gkeyll framework to improve computational efficiency in highly collisional gyrokinetic simulations, showing significant speedup and accuracy comparable to the LBD operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the restrictive time step and high computational cost in explicit schemes for collisional plasmas, enabling efficient simulations of highly collisional regimes.

Method: Implemented an implicit BGK collision operator in the Gkeyll framework, using an iterative scheme for conservation and generalizing it for cross-species collisions. Benchmarked against the LBD operator.

Result: The implicit BGK operator allows simulations to run 56 times faster than with LBD, with comparable accuracy in highly collisional regimes.

Conclusion: The implicit BGK operator is a robust and efficient alternative to the LBD operator for highly collisional gyrokinetic simulations.

Abstract: Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion
plasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain
of interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can
become overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to
high computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have
implemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use
in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll
framework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time
integrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time
step in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure
conservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme
to correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian
distribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further
generalized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction
routine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and
conservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more
computationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has
been utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables
2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56
times faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because
the BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is
required by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we
demonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK
operator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally
expensive LBD operator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the rate of propagation of chaos in systems with conditional expectations, addressing nonparametric challenges.

Method: Uses a regularized Nadaraya-Watson estimator for conditional expectations, combines entropy methods and information inequalities.

Result: Higher regularity for the density is achieved via bootstrap and energy estimates.

Conclusion: The approach successfully handles nonparametric aspects and provides rigorous results for propagation of chaos.

Abstract: We study the rate of propagation of chaos for a McKean--Vlasov equation with
conditional expectation terms in the drift. We use a (regularized)
Nadaraya--Watson estimator at a particle level to approximate the conditional
expectations; we then combine relative entropy methods in the spirit of Jabin
and Wang (2018) with information theoretic inequalities to obtain the result.
The nonparametric nature of the problem requires higher regularity for the
density of the McKean--Vlasov limit, which we obtain with a bootstrap argument
and energy estimates.

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Kuramoto model to a mean-field model on the unit circle and proposes a synchronization criterion based on the $L_1$-norm of the third derivative of the interaction function. It resolves a conjecture for self-attention dynamics, extending the synchronization range to $\beta \ge -0.16$ and proving no synchronization for $\beta < -2/3$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the Kuramoto model and analyze synchronization in a mean-field model of interacting particles on the unit circle, particularly for self-attention dynamics.

Method: Proposes a synchronization criterion using the $L_1$-norm of the third derivative of the interaction function and applies it to self-attention dynamics.

Result: Synchronization is proven for $\beta \ge -0.16$, extending prior bounds, and shown to not occur for $\beta < -2/3$.

Conclusion: The proposed criterion effectively generalizes synchronization analysis, resolving a conjecture and expanding understanding of self-attention dynamics.

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose
state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto
model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost
any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We
propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third
derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a
conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of
transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which
significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from
Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global
synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

TL;DR: A Steinberg-Guinan strength model for Rhenium (Re) is developed for high-pressure simulations, using atom-in-jellium predictions and experimental data. The model fits well up to 1 TPa but suggests lower flow stresses than observed, hinting at enhanced Re strength at megabar pressures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the design, modeling, and interpretation of Re's strength in high-pressure dynamic loading experiments, particularly for x-ray shielding in laser-driven experiments.

Method: Derived SG model parameters from atom-in-jellium predictions (shear modulus under compression) and rolled-bar studies (work-hardening). Fitted pressure-hardening to predictions up to 1 TPa and thermal softening from thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were extracted from Knoop microhardness measurements.

Result: The model fits well up to 1 TPa but predicts lower flow stresses than diamond anvil cell observations, suggesting Re may have enhanced strength at megabar pressures.

Conclusion: The model improves Re strength predictions under extreme conditions but highlights discrepancies at high pressures, guiding future theoretical and experimental work.

Abstract: Rhenium, Re, is used as an x-ray shield in laser-driven material property
experiments, where its strength at high pressures can be a consideration in the
design, modeling, and interpretation. We present a Steinberg-Guinan (SG)
strength model for Re, tailored for use in high-pressure dynamic loading
simulations. Parameters for the SG model were derived from recent
atom-in-jellium predictions of the shear modulus under compression and
experimental data on work-hardening from rolled-bar studies. The ambient shear
modulus was fixed to the measured value, and the pressure-hardening parameter
was fitted to the atom-in-jellium predictions up to 1 TPa. The shear modulus
model was still a reasonable fit beyond 25 TPa. Thermal softening was estimated
from the thermal expansivity and bulk modulus. Work-hardening parameters were
extracted by fitting the model to Knoop microhardness measurements under known
plastic strains. The resulting model captures the observed hardening behavior
but predicts significantly lower flow stresses at high pressures than diamond
anvil cell observations suggest, implying that Re may exhibit enhanced strength
at megabar pressures. These results provide a basis for improved modeling of
strength in Re under extreme conditions and suggest directions for further
theoretical and experimental investigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces two non-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se, enhancing photovoltaic performance through phase transitions and polarization effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sliding ferroelectrics have weak polarization states, limiting photovoltaic efficiency. The study aims to overcome this by designing stronger, distinct phases.

Method: First-principles calculations validate the synthesis of Janus In2S2Se and its reversible phase transitions via atomic layer sliding. Photovoltaic performances are analyzed.

Result: The WZ' to ZB' transition improves carrier mobility and band gap, enhancing infrared photocurrent. The WZ' phase boosts visible light efficiency due to stronger polarization.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for using non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity to optimize photovoltaic devices, offering new design insights.

Abstract: Two-dimensional sliding ferroelectrics, with their enhanced efficiencies of
charge separation and tunability, constitute promising platforms for
next-generation photovoltaic devices. However, recent systems predominantly
exhibit dual degenerate polarization states with weak intensity, hindering the
optimal manipulations of photovoltaic effects through sliding ferroelectricity.
Here, we address this limitation by introducing two strengthened and distinct
non-degenerate sliding ferroelectric phases (WZ' and ZB') in Janus In2S2Se,
which can be achieved by Se-to-S substitution in monolayer In2Se3.
First-principles calculations validate the experimental synthesis of this
structure and its capability for reversible phase transitions triggered by
atomic layer sliding, and a series of superior photovoltaic performances are
demonstrated in such unique Janus In2S2Se, accompanied by a detailed analysis
of how non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity modulates distinct photovoltaic
characteristics. The WZ' to ZB' transition can increase the carrier mobility
and moderate the band gap while inducing an indirect-to-direct transition,
yielding a marked red-shift and enhancement of the photocurrent peak in the
infrared spectrum. Conversely, the WZ' phase, benefiting from enhanced
polarization, delivers superior photoelectric conversion efficiency in the
visible light region. This work establishes a phase-engineered framework of how
non-degenerate sliding ferroelectricity orchestrates distinct photovoltaic
behaviors, and the intrinsic physical correlations may offer novel perspectives
for designing and regulating innovative photovoltaic devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study explores how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations in β12-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) influence charge and spin transport, revealing enhanced spin-dependent current in magnetic configurations and improved charge transport in nonmagnetic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between EPC and structural configurations in BNRs and their impact on charge and spin transport, aiming to optimize borophene-based logic devices.

Method: A tight-binding framework with ab initio-derived hopping parameters and phonons modeled via the Holstein model, using Landauer-Büttiker formalism for transport calculations.

Result: Spin-dependent EPC boosts spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag BNRs, while charge transport improves in nonmagnetic BNRs. Structural variations cause anisotropic EPC effects.

Conclusion: EPC is a key factor for designing borophene-based logic devices, with edge engineering offering control over transport properties.

Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing
carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in
nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic
$\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with
site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and
incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized
Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in
magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering
and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an
enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of
$\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC
effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights
establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic
devices through tailored edge engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the understanding of disk turbulence beyond the MRI by exploring non-axisymmetric instabilities like SARI and their impact on angular momentum transport.

Method: Uses the open-source Legolas software to analyze linear eigenfunctions, visualize spatio-temporal variations, and compare results with numerical simulations. A combined numerical-analytical approach studies field perturbations and polarization.

Result: SARI modes, even when superposed and linearly growing, can provide effective viscosity-related alpha-values for angular momentum transport. They introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube deformations.

Conclusion: The study expands the framework of disk instabilities, showing SARI's potential role in turbulence and angular momentum transport alongside MRI.

Abstract: For over 30 years, the Magneto-Rotational Instability has been accepted as
the mechanism driving accretion disk turbulence. Its physical basis is well
understood, where an interplay between centrifugal forces and magnetic tension
transfers angular momentum between oppositely displaced fluid elements. In this
work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field
topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the
Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source
\texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions
for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal
variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical
simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different
between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which
bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways.
We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of
the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of
differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to
recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting
stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can
already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for
angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show
that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce
plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.

Result: Uniqueness of the specified tangent cone in $\mathbb{R}^9$ is established, filling a gap in the literature.

Conclusion: This work finalizes the uniqueness results for cylindrical tangent cones of the form $C_{p,q} \times \mathbb{R}$ across dimensions.

Abstract: We show the uniqueness of the cylindrical tangent cone $C(\mathbb{S}^2 \times
\mathbb{S}^4) \times \mathbb{R}$ for area-minimizing hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{R}^9$, completing the uniqueness of all tangent cones of the form
$C_{p,q} \times \mathbb{R}$ proved by Simon for dimensions at least 10 and
Sz\'ekelyhidi for the Simons cone.

### [34] [Explaining Deep Network Classification of Matrices: A Case Study on Monotonicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22570)
*Leandro Farina,Sergey Korotov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning and XAI approach is used to derive human-interpretable rules for classifying monotone matrices, identifying key polynomial coefficients as criteria with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of easy characterizations for monotone matrices, despite their simple definition, by leveraging machine learning.

Method: Combines deep neural networks with explainable AI techniques on a dataset of randomly generated matrices to identify distinguishing features.

Result: Identified two coefficients of the characteristic polynomial as sufficient for classification with 95% accuracy, leading to a simple bound for monotone matrices.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a machine-learning approach to derive practical criteria for matrix classification, providing new insights into monotone matrices.

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover
simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic
properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI
(XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into
human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of
monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise
nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms
of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we
present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning
approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from
non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly
generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ
deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or
non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix
features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among
all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information
for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values
of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's
characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$
matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$
with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert =
1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound
$\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

### [35] [Formation and Evolution of Pair-Alfvén Shocks with PIC Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22175)
*John Daniel Riordan,Mark E. Dieckmann,Asaf Pe'er*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper studies pair-Alfvén shock waves in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, identifying stability conditions and growth mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and growth mechanisms of pair-Alfvén shock waves, which transition from Weibel instability to Alfvénic mediation.

Method: Particle-In-Cell simulations in 1D and 2D to analyze shock stability and sustaining mechanisms.

Result: Shock growth is sustained by self-generated Alfvén waves overtaking it upstream, requiring weak guiding magnetic fields (ω_c ≲ 0.4). High magnetization inhibits wave production.

Conclusion: The study explains the conditional absence of pair-Alfvén shocks, linking their growth to specific magnetic field strengths and wave-plasma resonance.

Abstract: We consider the recently discovered \emph{pair-Alfv\'en shock wave} occurring
in collisionless electron-positron plasmas. We perform a series of
Particle-In-Cell studies in one and two dimensions in order to determine the
stability conditions for such a shock and the mechanisms which sustain its
growth. Building on our previous simulations, which established that these
shocks are initially mediated by the Weibel instability before becoming
Alfv\'enic, we demonstrate that the shock is sustained by self-generated
Alfv\'en waves overtaking the shock in the upstream plasma. As a result growth
is only possible when the guiding magnetic field strength, and hence Alfv\'en
speed, is sufficiently small, $\omega_c \lesssim 0.4$ (in normalized units).
Furthermore the production of the waves in the upstream is dependent on a
resonance between the Alfv\'en wave mode and the thermal noise in the plasma,
which is inhibited at high magnetization. This explains the conditional absence
of this type of shock identified previously.

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper explains non-thermal particle acceleration in relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks via electromagnetic precursor filamentation and magnetic reconnection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand particle acceleration mechanisms in pulsar wind nebulae termination shocks.

Method: Analyzes shock-produced electromagnetic precursor filamentation and its interaction with upstream plasma, leading to magnetic reconnection.

Result: Filamentation instability creates relativistic shear flow and magnetic field distortions, enabling particle acceleration before shock entry.

Conclusion: The proposed scenario provides a viable mechanism for non-thermal particle acceleration in such shocks.

Abstract: We present a scenario that could explain non-thermal particle acceleration in
relativistic quasi-perpendicular electron-positron shocks, such as the
termination shock of pulsar wind nebulae. The shock produces a strong
electromagnetic precursor that propagates into the upstream plasma, which is
initially threaded by a uniform background magnetic field. We show that the
filamentation instability breaks the precursor into radiation filaments
parallel to the shock normal. The transverse scale of the filaments is of the
order of a few plasma skin depths. In the shock frame, the bulk Lorentz factor
of the upstream plasma is significantly reduced inside the radiation filaments.
Then, the instability produces a relativistic shear flow with strong velocity
gradients on kinetic scales. The velocity gradients distort the background
magnetic field lines, and generate a magnetic field component parallel to the
shock normal that reverses across each radiation filament, a configuration that
could trigger magnetic reconnection in the upstream plasma. These effects may
accelerate particles before the plasma enters the shock.
