The method\ncombines several advanced numerical techniques including the shifted Gegenbauer\npseudospectral (SGPS) method, Gegenbauer-based fractional approximation (GBFA),\nshifted Gegenbauer integration matrix (SGIM), shifted Gegenbauer integration\nrow vector (SGIRV), and SGDM to achieve spectral accuracy. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the HSG-IPS method outperforms existing numerical\napproaches, achieving significantly lower average absolute errors (AAEs) with\ncomputational times as low as 0.04-0.05 seconds. The method's robustness is\nvalidated across various fractional orders, showing excellent agreement with\nanalytical solutions. The transformation strategy effectively circumvents the\nnumerical instability associated with direct approximation of high-order\nderivatives in the original equation, while the use of shifted Gegenbauer (SG)\npolynomials and barycentric representations ensures numerical stability and\nefficiency.

Entropic regularization is often employed to solve the SOT\nproblem, leading to a regularized (RSOT) formulation that can be solved\nefficiently via its convex dual. However, a significant computational challenge\nemerges when the continuous source measure is discretized via the finite\nelement (FE) method to handle complex geometries or densities, such as those\narising from solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The evaluation\nof the dual objective function requires dense interactions between the numerous\nsource quadrature points and all target points, creating a severe bottleneck\nfor large-scale problems.
