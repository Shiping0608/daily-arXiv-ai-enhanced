This paper addresses the inverse\nproblem $\\mathbf{K}x = y$, where exact data $y$ is replaced by noisy data\n$y^\\delta$ satisfying $\\|y^\\delta - y\\|_Y \\leq \\delta$. Due to the\nill-posedness of such problems, we employ regularization methods to stabilize\nsolutions. While singular value decomposition (SVD) provides a classical\napproach, its computation can be costly and impractical for certain operators.\nWe explore alternatives via Diagonal Frame Decomposition (DFD), generalizing\nSVD-based techniques, and introduce a regularized solution $x^\\delta_\\alpha =\n\\sum_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\kappa_\\lambda g_\\alpha(\\kappa_\\lambda^2) \\langle\ny^\\delta, v_\\lambda \\rangle \\overline{u}_\\lambda$. Convergence rates and\noptimality are analyzed under a generalized source condition\n$\\mathbf{M}_{\\varphi, E} = \\{ x \\in \\text{dom} \\mathbf{K} : \\sum_{\\lambda \\in\n\\Lambda} [\\varphi(\\kappa_\\lambda^2)]^{-1} |\\langle x, u_\\lambda \\rangle|^2 \\leq\nE^2 \\}$. Key questions include constructing DFD systems, relating DFD and SVD\nsingular values, and extending source conditions.
