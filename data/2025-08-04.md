### [1] [Zeroing Diagonals, Conjugate Hollowization, and Characterizing Nondefinite Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00096)
*David R. Nicholus*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proves Damm and Fassbender's conjecture about transforming real traceless matrices into hollow or almost hollow forms via orthogonal similarity. It also generalizes this result and provides new insights into diagonal zero patterns and matrix characterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the conjecture by Damm and Fassbender and extend it to broader conditions, exploring the introduction of zeros in matrix diagonals and their implications.

Method: The method involves using orthogonal transformations to achieve hollow or almost hollow forms for matrices, with generalizations and corollaries to broader cases.

Result: The results include proving the conjecture, generalizing it, and deriving new characterizations of real traceless matrices, including a stronger version of Fillmore's theorem.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a broader classification of nondefinite matrices based on diagonal zero patterns, enhancing understanding of matrix transformations.

Abstract: We prove the conjecture by Damm and Fassbender that, for any pair $L,M$ of
real traceless matrices, there exists an orthogonal $V$ such that $V^{-1} L \,
V$ is hollow and $V M V^{-1}$ is almost hollow, where a matrix is hollow if and
only if its main diagonal consists only of 0s, and a traceless matrix is almost
hollow if and only if all its main diagonal elements are 0 except, at most, the
last two.
  The claim is a corollary to our considerably more general theorem, as well as
another corollary, revealing conditions on $L,M$ under which 0s can be
introduced by $V$ to all but the first or first two diagonal elements of
$V^{-1} L \, V$ and to all but the last two diagonal elements of $V M V^{-1}$.
  By setting $L = M$, much is revealed concerning freedom and constraint
involved in introducing 0s to the diagonal of a single operator. From this we
prove novel characterizations of real traceless matrices, and a stronger
version of the seminal theorem by Fillmore that every real matrix is
orthogonally similar to a matrix with a constant main diagonal.
  Our results are contextualized in a characterization and classification of
nondefinite matrices by, roughly, how many zeros can be introduced to their
diagonals, and it what ways.

### [2] [Leveraging Operator Learning to Accelerate Convergence of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00101)
*Alena Kopaničáková,Youngkyu Lee,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new deflation strategy using DeepONet accelerates PCG convergence for large-scale linear systems by generating deflation subspaces via operator learning, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deflation techniques rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov subspaces, which may be inefficient or limited. The paper aims to improve convergence using DeepONet-based deflation.

Method: Two approaches are introduced: approximating near-null space vectors using DeepONet-learned basis functions and leveraging DeepONet-predicted solutions. Sparsity patterns for deflation operators are also optimized.

Result: Numerical experiments show the DeepONet-based deflated PCG method is effective across various problems, including steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued cases.

Conclusion: The proposed method generalizes well across model parameters and resolutions, demonstrating superior performance over traditional deflation techniques.

Abstract: We propose a new deflation strategy to accelerate the convergence of the
preconditioned conjugate gradient(PCG) method for solving parametric
large-scale linear systems of equations. Unlike traditional deflation
techniques that rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov
subspaces, we generate the deflation subspaces using operator learning,
specifically the Deep Operator Network~(DeepONet). To this aim, we introduce
two complementary approaches for assembling the deflation operators. The first
approach approximates near-null space vectors of the discrete PDE operator
using the basis functions learned by the DeepONet. The second approach directly
leverages solutions predicted by the DeepONet. To further enhance convergence,
we also propose several strategies for prescribing the sparsity pattern of the
deflation operator. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments encompassing
steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued problems posed on both
structured and unstructured geometries is presented and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed DeepONet-based deflated PCG method, as well as
its generalization across a wide range of model parameters and problem
resolutions.

### [3] [Partial Floquet Transformation and Model Order Reduction of Linear Time-Periodic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00221)
*Sam Bender,Christopher Beattie*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a partial Floquet transformation for model reduction in large-scale linear time-periodic (LTP) systems, addressing computational challenges of classical Floquet transforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale LTP systems arise from linearizing nonlinear systems about periodic solutions, necessitating efficient model reduction for varied input profiles.

Method: Develops a partial Floquet transformation linked to invariant subspaces, using a modified Dominant Pole Algorithm to identify subspaces for reduction.

Result: Demonstrates the construction of partial Floquet transformations and reduction bases, applying them to a simple LTP system.

Conclusion: The approach offers a tractable method for model reduction in LTP systems, overcoming limitations of traditional Floquet transforms.

Abstract: Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as
engineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for
example, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given
periodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing)
with subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate
responses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a
baseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model
reduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems.
Classical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system
structure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the
Floquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this
paper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to
selected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated
with the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of
Rommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We
discuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and
time-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP
models and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.

### [4] [A reduced-IRKA method for large-scale $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model order reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00242)
*Yiding Lin,Valeria Simoncini*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Order Reduction (MOR) is one of the most
significant frameworks for reduction methodologies for linear dynamical
systems. In this context, the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (\IRKA) is a
well established method for computing an optimal projection space of fixed
dimension $r$, when the system has small or medium dimensions. However, for
large problems the performance of \IRKA\ is not satisfactory. In this paper, we
introduce a new rational Krylov subspace projection method with conveniently
selected shifts, that can effectively handle large-scale problems. The
projection subspace is generated sequentially, and the \IRKA\ procedure is
employed on the projected problem to produce a new optimal rational space of
dimension $r$ for the reduced problem, and the associated shifts. The latter
are then injected to expand the projection space. Truncation of older
information of the generated space is performed to limit memory requirements.
Numerical experiments on benchmark problems illustrate the effectiveness of the
new method.

### [5] [A COGENT case study: Supporting Applications with Chombo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00375)

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper discusses how the Chombo framework adapted to meet the needs of the COGENT application, enabling unique tokamak edge layer simulations and benefiting other applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how a software framework (Chombo) can evolve to support specific scientific applications (COGENT) and subsequently aid other projects with similar requirements.

Method: Case study of Chombo's collaboration with COGENT, involving the design and implementation of new capabilities like higher-order mapped-multiblock discretizations and multi-dimensional code organization.

Result: COGENT successfully developed a unique simulation capability for tokamak edge layers, and the new Chombo features also supported other applications.

Conclusion: The Chombo framework's adaptability to specific needs (like COGENT's) highlights its value in advancing scientific simulations and fostering broader application support.

Abstract: We present a case study of how a software framework (Chombo) supported the
specific needs of a scientific application (COGENT). Since its inception in
2000, the Chombo framework has supported various applications. One example of
such support has been the collaboration with the Edge Simulation Laboratory to
build the COGENT model. The specific needs of the COGENT effort required the
design and implementation of a set of new capabilities in the Chombo framework,
such as higher-order mapped-multiblock discretizations and multi-dimensional
code organization. These capabilities allowed COGENT to develop a unique
simulation capability for modeling the edge layers in tokamaks. Once developed,
these capabilities were able to support other applications which had similar
needs.

### [6] [A new addition theorem for the 3-D Navier-Lamé system and its application to the method of fundamental solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00515)
*J. A. Barceló,C. Castro,A. Ruiz,M. C. Vilela*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new addition theorem simplifies the fundamental solution of the Navier-Lamé system in 3D, using Bessel functions and spherical harmonics, aiding numerical methods like boundary element and fundamental solutions methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the fundamental solution of the Navier-Lamé system for practical use in numerical methods, especially in exterior domains.

Method: Develops an expansion of the fundamental solution involving Bessel functions and scalar spherical harmonics, validated for collocation numerical methods.

Result: The method proves efficient for approximating the Navier-Lamé system in exterior domains, particularly with the method of fundamental solutions.

Conclusion: The new theorem enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in numerical methods for the Navier-Lamé system.

Abstract: We obtain a new addition theorem for the fundamental solution of the
Navier-Lam\'e system in dimension 3 satisfying the Kupradze radiation
conditions. This provides an expansion of this fundamental solution that
involves only the evaluation of Bessel functions and scalar spherical
harmonics. This is particularly useful in collocation numerical methods based
on fundamental solutions, such as the boundary element method or the method of
fundamental solutions. For this last method, we show its efficiency when
approximating the Navier-Lam\'e system in exterior domains.

### [7] [Solitary-wave solutions of the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation. II. A numerical study of the dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00559)
*Angel Durán,Nuria Reguera*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Numerical study of solitary wave dynamics in the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation using a Fourier spectral method and fourth-order Runge-Kutta-Composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the stability and behavior of solitary wave solutions under perturbations and interactions.

Method: Fourier spectral method for spatial discretization and fourth-order Runge-Kutta-Composition for time integration.

Result: Discusses effects of perturbations, solitary wave interactions, and initial data resolution into wave trains.

Conclusion: Provides insights into the stability and dynamics of solitary waves in the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

Abstract: The present paper is a numerical study of the dynamics of solitary wave
solutions of the fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, whose existence
was analyzed by the authors in the first part of the project. The computational
study will be made from the approximation of the periodic initial-value problem
with a fully discrete scheme consisting of a Fourier spectral method for the
spatial discretization and a fourth-order, Runge-Kutta-Composition method as
time integrator. Several issues regarding the stability of the waves, such as
the effects of small and large perturbations, interactions of solitary waves
and the resolution of initial data into trains of waves are discussed.

### [8] [Towards a mixed-precision ADI method for Lyapunov equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00722)
*Jonas Schulze,Jens Saak*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Mixed-precision applied to LR-ADI improves efficiency by using lower precision for certain steps, tested on Lyapunov equations from descriptor systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance computational efficiency of the LR-ADI algorithm by leveraging mixed-precision without significantly compromising accuracy.

Method: Perform parts of the LR-ADI algorithm (solution accumulation, linear system solving, residual storage) in single or double precision.

Result: For first-order systems, single-precision accumulation yields residuals nearly as small as double-precision. Mixed-precision is competitive for tasks like H2 norm computation.

Conclusion: Mixed-precision LR-ADI is viable for certain applications, offering efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: We apply mixed-precision to the low-rank Lyapunov ADI (LR-ADI) by performing
certain aspects of the algorithm in a lower working precision. Namely, we
accumulate the overall solution, solve the linear systems comprising the ADI
iteration, and store the inner low-rank factors of the residuals in various
combinations of IEEE 754 single and double precision. We empirically test our
implementation on Lyapunov equations arising from first- and second-order
descriptor systems. For the first-order examples, accumulating the solution in
single-precision yields an almost-as-small residual as for the double-precision
solution. For certain applications, like computing the H2 norm of a descriptor
system, low- or mixed-precision variants of the ADI can be quite competitive

### [9] [Infinite-order rogue waves that are small (but not small in $L^2$)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00070)
*Deniz Bilman,Peter D. Miller*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies the asymptotic behavior of general rogue waves of infinite order in the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation, showing concentration on a specific curve and deriving leading-order behavior in terms of elliptic functions and modulated solitons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the properties and behavior of rogue waves of infinite order, particularly their finite $L^2$-norm and slow temporal decay, in a specific parametric limit.

Method: Investigates the asymptotic behavior in a parametric limit where the solution becomes small uniformly on compact sets while the $L^2$-norm remains fixed, using logarithmic rescaling of space-time coordinates.

Result: The solution is concentrated on one side of a specific curve, with leading-order behavior described by elliptic functions and modulated solitons near the boundary. The $L^2$-norm remains fixed despite uniform smallness.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the asymptotic properties of rogue waves of infinite order, capturing their fixed $L^2$-norm and spatial concentration in a parametric limit.

Abstract: General rogue waves of infinite order constitute a family of solutions of the
focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that have recently been identified in
a variety of asymptotic limits such as high-order iteration of B\"acklund
transformations and semiclassical focusing of pulses with specific amplitude
profiles. These solutions have compelling properties such as finite $L^2$-norm
contrasted with anomalously slow temporal decay in the absence of coherent
structures. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of general
rogue waves of infinite order in a parametric limit in which the solution
becomes small uniformly on compact sets while the $L^2$-norm remains fixed. We
show that the solution is primarily concentrated on one side of a specific
curve in logarithmically rescaled space-time coordinates, and we obtain the
leading-order asymptotic behavior of the solution in this region in terms of
elliptic functions as well as near the boundary curve in terms of modulated
solitons. The asymptotic formula captures the fixed $L^2$-norm even as the
solution becomes uniformly small.

*Elias Hess-Childs,Keefer Rowan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper constructs an explicit divergence-free vector field in a specific function space, demonstrating multiple anomalous phenomena and validating the sharpness of a theoretical regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and rigorously demonstrate anomalous behaviors in fluid dynamics, such as dissipation and dispersion, and to test theoretical predictions like the Obukhov-Corrsin regime.

Method: The authors construct an explicit divergence-free vector field in the space $L^\infty([0,1],C^\alpha(\mathbb{T}^2))$ and analyze its properties.

Result: The constructed vector field exhibits universal anomalous dissipation, enhanced dissipation, Richardson dispersion, anomalous regularization, and spatial intermittency. It also confirms the sharpness of the Obukhov-Corrsin regime for certain parameters.

Conclusion: The study provides concrete examples of anomalous fluid dynamics phenomena and validates theoretical predictions, contributing to deeper understanding of turbulent flows.

Abstract: For all $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector
field $V \in L^\infty([0,1],C^\alpha(\mathbb{T}^2))$ that exhibits universal
anomalous (total) dissipation, accelerating dissipation enhancement, Richardson
dispersion, anomalous regularization, and spatial intermittency. Additionally,
we demonstrate the sharpness of the intermittent Obukhov-Corrsin regime for
certain parameter ranges.

### [11] [Global solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on spacetimes close to the Minkowski space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00122)
*Seokchang Hong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Global existence and decay estimates for cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on curved backgrounds near Minkowski spacetime, using wave-type reduction and refined energy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the behavior of solutions to Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on curved spacetimes, addressing challenges posed by the commutator structure and spacetime-dependent gamma matrices.

Method: Squared Dirac operator to reduce to a wave-type equation, applied energy estimates with vector field methods and hyperboloidal foliation.

Result: Established global existence and sharp pointwise decay estimates for solutions.

Conclusion: The refined methods successfully address the commutator and gamma matrix challenges, providing robust results for such systems.

Abstract: We establish global existence and derive sharp pointwise decay estimates of
solutions to cubic Dirac and Dirac-Klein-Gordon systems on a curved background,
close to the Minkowski spacetime. By squaring the Dirac operator, we reduce the
analysis to a nonlinear wave-type equation involving spinorial connections, and
apply energy estimates based on vector field methods and the hyperboloidal
foliation framework, introduced by LeFloch-Ma. A key difficulty arises from the
commutator structure of the Dirac operator, which exhibits significantly
different behaviour from that of scalar field equations and requires refined
control throughout the analysis, particularly due to the spacetime-dependent
gamma matrices, which reduce to constant matrices in the flat Minkowski
spacetime.

### [12] [Long-time evolution of forced waves in the low viscosity regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00189)
*Nicolas Frantz,Michał Wrochna*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a model for internal waves with a damped Hamiltonian and viscosity, showing dissipation effects emerge at a specific time scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-time behavior of solutions for internal waves under damping and viscosity, especially in small viscosity regimes.

Method: Uses a zero-order pseudo-differential Hamiltonian damped by a second-order viscosity term, under Morse-Smale or similar conditions.

Result: Dissipation effects appear no earlier than the time scale t ∼ ν^(-1/3-).

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the delayed onset of dissipation in damped internal wave systems.

Abstract: We consider a model for internal waves described by a zero order
pseudo-differential Hamiltonian $P$ damped by a second order viscosity term $i
\nu Q$. Under Morse-Smale or similar weaker global conditions on the classical
dynamics, we describe qualitatively the long-time behavior of solutions of the
corresponding evolution equation with smooth forcing in a small $\nu$ regime.
We show that dissipation effects arise no earlier than at the $t\sim
\nu^{-1/3-}$ time scale.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces nonlocal free boundary minimal hypersurfaces, analyzing their critical points, Euler-Lagrange equations, and surprising properties like boundary-free critical points and volume constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the study of minimal hypersurfaces to the nonlocal setting, exploring new phenomena and properties not present in classical cases.

Method: Uses fractional perimeter and inner variations to derive Euler-Lagrange equations, then examines existence, stickiness, and regularity.

Result: Reveals unexpected features like boundary-free critical points and strong volume constraints for unbounded hypersurfaces.

Conclusion: The nonlocal framework introduces novel behaviors in minimal hypersurfaces, expanding theoretical understanding and potential applications.

Abstract: We introduce the nonlocal analogue of the classical free boundary minimal
hypersurfaces in an open domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the (boundaries
of) critical points of the fractional perimeter
$\operatorname{Per}_s(\cdot,\,\Omega )$ with respect to inner variations
leaving $\Omega$ invariant. We deduce the Euler-Lagrange equations and prove a
few surprising features, such as the existence of critical points without
boundary and a strong volume constraint in $\Omega$ for unbounded
hypersurfaces. Moreover, we investigate stickiness properties and regularity
across the boundary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand dynamical interactions between wind and water waves through two-phase free interface problems.

water waves near Taylor-Couette flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a question posed by Mironescu and Brezis--Mironescu regarding minimal maps in Sobolev spaces.

Method: Combines results from Mazowiecka--Schikorra and Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu, extending them to the case n=1 and 1<p<2.

Result: Existence of minimal maps of degree one in W^(1/p,p)(S^1,S^1) for p in [p',2], where p'≈1.13924.

Conclusion: The study provides an affirmative answer to the posed question for the specified range of p.

Abstract: In this note, we show how the results of Mazowiecka--Schikorra, combined with
those of Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu, imply the existence of minimal maps of
degree one in $ W^{\frac{1}{p},p}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{S}^1) $ for $ p \in [p',
2] $, where $ p' \approx 1.13924 $. This provides an affirmative answer in this
range to a question posed by Mironescu and Brezis--Mironescu. In order to do
so, we complement the results of Mazowiecka--Schikorra by extending them to the
case $ n = 1 $ and $ 1 < p < 2 $, which had been excluded there for technical
reasons.

### [16] [Long Time Existence of A Flow of Elliptic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00551)
*Woongbae Park,Lei Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper constructs a monotone entropy form for elliptic systems on Riemann surfaces, proving long-term existence of parabolic flows and extending existence results to Liouville and Toda systems without topological constraints or coefficient bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in existence results for Liouville and Toda systems on Riemann surfaces by developing a unified approach.

Method: Constructing a monotone entropy form and analyzing the long-term existence of parabolic system flows.

Result: Existence results for broad classes of elliptic systems, including Liouville and Toda systems, without requiring topological information or coefficient bounds.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unifies existence proofs for diverse elliptic systems, demonstrating robustness and generality.

Abstract: For elliptic systems defined on Riemann surfaces, Liouville and Toda systems
represent two well-known classes exhibiting drastically different solution
structures. Over the years, existence results for these systems have
highlighted discrepancies due to their unique solution structures. In this
work, we aim to construct a monotone entropy form and establish the long-term
existence of a flow of parabolic systems. As a result of our main theorem, we
can prove existence results for some broad classes of elliptic systems,
including both Liouville and Toda systems. The strength of our results is
further underscored by the fact that no topological information about the
Riemann surfaces is required and no positive lower bound of coefficient
functions is postulated.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a rigorous solution theory for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity on the torus, proving global existence, uniqueness, and energy conservation for small initial data in $H^1$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous solution theory for periodic nonlinear Schrödinger equations with concentrated nonlinearity.

Method: Uses two approximation schemes: the concentrated limit of a smoothed equation and the inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.

Result: Global energy-conserving solutions for small $H^1$ data and local well-posedness below the energy space.

Conclusion: First rigorous solution theory for this class of equations, advancing understanding of nonlinear Schrödinger dynamics with concentrated nonlinearity.

Abstract: We study the solution theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a
concentrated nonlinearity on the torus. In particular, we establish existence
and uniqueness of global energy-conserving solutions for small initial data in
$H^1$. Our approach is based on two approximation schemes, namely the
concentrated limit of a smoothed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the
inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We also
prove local well-posedness below the energy space. To our knowledge, this is
the first rigorous solution theory for a periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation with a concentrated nonlinearity.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A method using harmonic mapping theory is developed to solve the 2D Boussinesq equations, yielding explicit solutions like Kirchhoff's vortex and Gerstner's wave.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive explicit solutions for the 2D Boussinesq equations by leveraging harmonic mapping theory.

Method: Reformulate flow solutions via harmonic functions, reduce to a nonlinear differential system, and solve using Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives.

Result: Explicit solutions in Lagrangian coordinates, including Kirchhoff's elliptical vortex and Gerstner's gravity wave.

Conclusion: The method successfully provides classical solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of harmonic mapping theory in solving the 2D Boussinesq equations.

Abstract: Within the framework of Lagrangian variables, we develop a method for
deriving explicit solutions to the 2D Boussinesq equations using harmonic
mapping theory. By reformulating the characterization of flow solutions
described by harmonic functions, we reduce the problem to solving a particular
nonlinear differential system in complex space. To solve this nonlinear
differential system, we introduce the Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian
derivatives, and derive the properties of the sense-preserving harmonic
mappings with equal Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives. Our method
yields explicit solutions in Lagrangian coordinates that contain two
fundamental classes of classical solutions.: Kirchhoff's elliptical vortex
(1876) and Gerstner's gravity wave (1809, rediscovered by Rankine in 1863).

*Elisa Affili,Enrique Zuazua*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies controllability in a competition-diffusion Lotka-Volterra system, showing it can steer to extinction of the less competitive species but not the more competitive one under unbalanced competition rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand ecological management policies via boundary controls in species density regulation.

Method: Analyzes one-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system with Dirichlet boundary controls, using spectral properties of reaction-diffusion operators and numerical simulations.

Result: Controllability to extinction of the less competitive species is possible, but not for the more competitive species under unbalanced competition rates due to barrier solutions.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in controllability due to unbalanced competition, with implications for ecological management and future research.

Abstract: We investigate the controllability of the competition-diffusion
Lotka-Volterra system. Our primary focus is on the one-dimensional setting with
Dirichlet boundary controls, interpreted as ecological management policies
regulating the density of species at the habitat boundaries and satisfying
bilateral constraints. We show that the system can be steered from any initial
state to a constant steady state representing the extinction of the less
competitive species. In contrast, we prove that controllability toward a steady
state where the more competitive species vanishes is generally not achievable
when the inter-species competition rates are too unbalanced. This obstruction
is due to the existence of barrier solutions, which we explicitly construct
based on the spectral properties of the associated reaction-diffusion
operators. Our theoretical results are illustrated through numerical
simulations and are accompanied by a discussion of open problems and potential
directions for future research.

### [20] [Time asymptotics, time regularity and separation rates for Navier-Stokes flows in supercritical solution classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00714)
*Zachary Bradshaw,Joshua Hudson*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Extends weak solution theory for 3D Navier-Stokes equations to supercritical settings, includes energy bounds and stability under weak-star convergence. Applications include local asymptotic expansion and higher-order time regularity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize weak solution theory for 3D Navier-Stokes equations beyond critical settings, ensuring robust energy bounds and stability.

Method: Extends existing theory to supercritical settings, incorporating a priori energy bounds and weak-star convergence stability.

Result: Provides local asymptotic expansion and higher-order time regularity insights, quantifying singularity effects.

Conclusion: The extension offers deeper theoretical understanding and practical tools for analyzing Navier-Stokes solutions in supercritical contexts.

Abstract: This paper extends the weak solution theory for the 3D Navier-Stokes
equations of Barker, Seregin and Sverak from a critical setting to a
supercritical setting making sure to include a useful a priori energy bound as
well as a statement about stability under weak-star convergence. Two
applications of the a priori bound are then explored. The first provides a
spatially local, short-time asymptotic expansion in the time variable starting
at $t=0$ which, as a corollary, provides an upper bound on how fast
hypothetical non-unique solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations can separate
locally. The second establishes higher-order time regularity at a singular time
and at spatial points positioned away from the singularity. This quantifies the
degree to which the non-local nature of the pressure allows a far flung
singularity to disrupt the time regularity at a regular point.

*Lidong Fang,Zilong Song,Kirk Fraser,Huaxiong Huang*

TL;DR: The paper explores POD-MOR in SPH simulations for a mass-spring-damper system, showing effective reduction of degrees of freedom and potential for accelerated computations without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate POD-MOR performance in a Lagrangian context and explore methods to speed up computations, addressing a gap in existing MOR research focused on Eulerian frameworks.

Method: POD-MOR applied to SPH simulations of a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system, analyzing performance and computational acceleration techniques.

Result: POD-MOR reduces SPH simulation degrees of freedom by capturing essential modes and can be accelerated without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings encourage further research into POD-MOR algorithms for nonlinear Lagrangian systems.

Abstract: Model Order Reduction (MOR) based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has proven effective in various
applications. Most MOR methods utilizing POD are implemented within a pure
Eulerian framework, while significantly less attention has been given to POD in
a Lagrangian context. In this paper, we present the POD-MOR of SPH simulations
applied to a mass-spring-damper system with two primary objectives: 1. To
evaluate the performance of the data-driven POD-MOR approach. 2. To investigate
potential methods for accelerating POD-MOR computations. Although the
mass-spring-damper system is linear, its SPH implementations are nonlinear, and
POD-MOR does not automatically lead to faster computations. Our findings
indicate that (1) the POD-MOR effectively reduces the degrees of freedom in the
SPH simulations by capturing the essential modes, and (2) in various cases, the
acceleration of POD-MOR can be achieved without compromising accuracy. We hope
that our results will motivate further investigations into the design of
POD-MOR algorithms for nonlinear Lagrangian systems.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper extends Maxwell's gas theory to derive Kappa-type velocity distributions, identifying a fat-tailed form that fits suprathermal data well. It introduces a natural kinetic temperature, avoiding the need for an effective temperature, and specifies a unique parameter value for accurate data fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Maxwell's gas theory and derive a broader class of Kappa distributions that better fit observed suprathermal data, while addressing inconsistencies in temperature definitions.

Method: Extends Maxwell's prescription to derive Kappa-type distributions, focusing on fat-tailed forms. The model naturally incorporates a kinetic temperature, eliminating reliance on an effective temperature.

Result: A physically consistent fat-tailed Kappa distribution is derived, fitting suprathermal data accurately. The model introduces a natural kinetic temperature and identifies a specific parameter value for optimal fitting.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for Kappa distributions, resolving temperature inconsistencies and offering a precise fit for suprathermal data with a unique parameter value.

Abstract: An extension of Maxwell's original prescription for an ideal gas is adopted
to derive a broad class of Kappa-type velocity distributions, encompassing both
fat and short-tailed forms. Within this general framework, a physically
consistent fat-tailed Kappa distribution is identified that accurately fits
recent suprathermal data. In particular, a kinetic physical temperature $T$
emerges naturally from the model, eliminating the need to invoke an effective
temperature $T_{\kappa\ell}$, as is commonly done in the literature. Finally,
it is argued that only a particular value of $\ell$ ensures a satisfactory fit
to the data when the physical kinetic temperature is employed.

*Zhiyu Yin,James F. Drake,Marc Swisdak*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores electron and proton heating during magnetic reconnection, revealing protons gain more energy due to their larger initial energy gain and faster subsequent energization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the differential heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection.

Method: Simulations using the kglobal model with varied proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures.

Result: Protons heat and energize more than electrons, especially during initial exhaust entry and subsequent Fermi reflection processes.

Conclusion: Protons consistently gain more energy than electrons, leading to higher proton temperatures and non-thermal energy content.

Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons
and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried
out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended
powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in
observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of
proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors
that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream
temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization
exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger
energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The
effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since
the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial
electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$.
Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in
large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to
energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration
of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that
of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that
of electrons.

Motivation: Overcome dephasing limitations in laser-plasma accelerators to enhance electron beam performance.

Method: Use a Joule-class femtosecond laser in an optical-field-ionized plasma waveguide with a controlled density gradient.

Result: Achieved electron beam energies exceeding 1.6 GeV, a 40% increase compared to constant-density cases.

Conclusion: Density tapering and optical guiding effectively extend acceleration length, with delayed injection and nonlinear laser evolution playing key roles.

Abstract: Laser-plasma accelerators offer a compact means of producing high-energy
electron beams, but their performance is fundamentally limited by dephasing
between the accelerated electrons and the plasma wave. To overcome this
limitation, we investigate the combination of plasma density tapering and
optical guiding to extend the effective acceleration length. Using a
Joule-class femtosecond laser coupled into an optical-field-ionized plasma
waveguide with a controlled density gradient, we experimentally achieve
electron beam energies exceeding 1.6 GeV, a 40% increase compared to the
constant-density case. Particle-in-cell simulations reproduce the main
experimental features and reveal the central roles of delayed injection,
nonlinear laser evolution, and self-focusing in enhancing energy gain.

TL;DR: Pulsed fuel gas injection in ADITYA-U Tokamak reduces SOL heat flux width and improves core confinement, validated by analytical models and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective methods for controlling SOL heat flux in fusion devices.

Method: Comparative analysis of pulsed vs. continuous gas fuelling, supported by analytical modeling and UEDGE code simulations.

Result: Pulsed fuelling reduces heat flux near LCFS and broadens SOL width, requiring increased cross-field diffusion and inward pinch.

Conclusion: Pulsed fuelling is a viable strategy for SOL heat flux control in future fusion devices.

Abstract: Enhancement of the scrape-off layer (SOL) heat flux width has been observed
in the ADITYA-U Tokamak following the injection of short fuel gas pulses. A
notable reduction in parallel heat flux near the last closed flux surface
(LCFS) is observed after each pulse. Comparative analysis indicates that pulsed
fuelling is more effective in mitigating heat flux with improved core
confinement than continuous gas feeding via real-time density control.
Analytical and simulation works are also carried out for validation of
experimental results. The analytical model shows that SOL width modification
cannot be attributed solely to the decrease of temperature due to gas pulse
injection; cross-field plasma diffusion also needs to increase. Simulations
with the UEDGE code suggest that an increase in both the cross-field diffusion
coefficient and inward pinch velocity is necessary to replicate the
experimentally observed broadening of the heat flux SOL width. These findings
provide insights into efficient SOL heat flux control strategies for future
fusion devices.

TL;DR: A single ultra-intense laser pulse reflected off a curved plasma mirror efficiently generates collimated electron-positron pairs, surpassing multi-laser methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the challenge of producing well-collimated particle beams from light-to-matter conversion, crucial for practical applications.

Method: Using a single ultra-intense laser pulse (a0 > 2000) reflected from a curved plasma mirror to trigger QED cascades.

Result: Highly collimated electron-positron pairs are produced, even at modest laser powers (13PW), with unprecedented efficiency.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables new studies of QED processes and controlled matter-antimatter plasmas, feasible with current laser facilities.

Abstract: Converting light into matter has been a longstanding goal in physics,
particularly the creation of electron-positron pairs through quantum
electrodynamic (QED) processes. While current approaches using multiple
colliding laser pulses can achieve this conversion, they struggle to produce
well-collimated particle beams - a crucial requirement for practical
applications. Here we demonstrate that a single ultra-intense laser pulse, when
reflected from a curved plasma mirror, can generate highly collimated
electron-positron pairs with unprecedented efficiency. By focusing the laser to
field strengths exceeding $a_0 > 2000$, our method triggers QED cascades that
produce tightly focused particle beams, distinctly different from the diffuse
plasmas created by conventional multi-laser setups. The technique works even at
relatively modest laser powers of 13PW, making it immediately testable at
existing facilities. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for studying
fundamental QED processes and generating controlled matter-antimatter plasmas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore TSPWs beyond simplified slab geometry, focusing on their behavior in cylindrical plasma-vacuum interfaces and under non-uniform magnetic fields.

Method: Analyzed TSPWs at cylindrical boundaries, examining resonant coupling to upper-hybrid modes and damping effects in temporal and spatial domains.

Result: TSPWs exhibit collisionless damping and maintain topological robustness even with non-uniform magnetic fields.

Conclusion: The study confirms the adaptability and resilience of TSPWs in more complex geometries and varying magnetic conditions.

Abstract: We present an extension of recently discovered collisionlessly damped yet
topologically protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs), from a simplified slab
geometry to a cylindrical plasma-vacuum interface. A distinctive feature of
these modes-emerging above the electron cyclotron frequency-is their
collisionless damping, which arises from resonant coupling to a continuum of
upper-hybrid modes localized within a smooth plasma-vacuum transition layer. We
demonstrate both temporal and spatial damping of TSPWs at the boundary of a
cylindrical magnetized plasma. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of a
non-uniform magnetic field, the TSPW exhibits a smooth and continuous
transition, highlighting its topological robustness under magnetic
inhomogeneity.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A scalable framework for predicting spectrum availability combines Markov chain modeling of primary user activity with ITU-R propagation models to enable proactive, interference-free dynamic spectrum access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectrum resources are often underutilized, necessitating dynamic access strategies to exploit unused frequencies without interfering with primary users.

Method: The approach integrates a two-state Markov chain for temporal occupancy patterns and ITU-R propagation models (P.528, P.2108) for spatial signal analysis.

Result: The framework accurately predicts spectrum opportunities in time and space with low computational cost, suitable for real-time management.

Conclusion: The proposed method is flexible, scalable, and effective for dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks.

Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating
dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused
frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be
available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive
and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for
spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model
of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R
(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures
temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss
and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference
thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the
proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with
improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach,
analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions,
limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be
adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show
that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low
computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in
cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness in three case studies: drag reduction, wake control, and wall-model learning, using different solvers.

Conclusion: SmartFlow's design accelerates RL-driven fluid mechanics research by offering solver-agnostic flexibility and HPC integration.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a powerful tool for
fluid-dynamics research, encompassing active flow control, autonomous
navigation, turbulence modeling and discovery of novel numerical schemes. We
introduce SmartFlow, a CFD-solver-agnostic framework for both single- and
multi-agent DRL algorithms that can easily integrate with MPI-parallel CPU and
GPU-accelerated solvers. Built on Relexi and SmartSOD2D, SmartFlow uses the
SmartSim infrastructure library and our newly developed SmartRedis-MPI library
to enable asynchronous, low-latency, in-memory communication between CFD
solvers and Python-based DRL algorithms. SmartFlow leverages PyTorch's
Stable-Baselines3 for training, which provides a modular, Gym-like environment
API. We demonstrate its versatility via three case studies: single-agent
synthetic-jet control for drag reduction in a cylinder flow simulated by the
high-order FLEXI solver, multi-agent cylinder wake control using the
GPU-accelerated spectral-element code SOD2D, and multi-agent wall-model
learning for large-eddy simulation with the finite-difference solver CaLES.
SmartFlow's CFD-solver-agnostic design and seamless HPC integration is
promising to accelerate RL-driven fluid-mechanics studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) variant using weighted sinusoidal functions, proving its validity and showing competitive performance against MLPs and fixed-frequency Fourier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternatives to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and spline-based KANs by leveraging sinusoidal functions for better function approximation.

Method: Replaces inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of learnable frequencies, fixing phases to constant values. Theoretical proof and numerical experiments validate the approach.

Result: The proposed KAN variant outperforms fixed-frequency Fourier methods and matches MLPs in performance on multivariable function tasks.

Conclusion: The sinusoidal-based KAN offers a viable alternative to MLPs, combining theoretical validity with practical performance.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous
multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of
continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this
representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a
smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the
proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron
networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical
direction of most modern neural networks.
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an
alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear
activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis
spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and
sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works
have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we
propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of
learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and
Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced
constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also
conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of
multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform
methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the
fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A variational method using shadow tomography for efficient ground state correlation computation in quantum spin Hamiltonians, optimizing snapshots to lower energy and ensure physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians by leveraging shadow tomography and variational optimization.

Method: Uses a bag of parametrized snapshots representing the ground state, optimized for energy reduction. Incorporates constraints like positivity of reduced density matrices for physical consistency.

Result: The method is parallelizable, efficiently simulable, and provides a more complete ground state description.

Conclusion: The variational scheme with shadow tomography offers an efficient and scalable approach for ground state correlation estimation in quantum systems.

Abstract: We introduce a variational scheme inspired by classical shadow tomography to
compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians. Shadow
tomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of
arbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called
snapshots, on copies of the state $\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer
expectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\epsilon$ using
just $N \sim 3^k \text{log}M /\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are
performed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can
be considered an efficient representation of the state $\rho$, particularly for
estimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed
to estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme
wherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative
ground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the
energy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of
reduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed
to ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying
Hilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the
underlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further
correlations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with
numerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is
efficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground
state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a framework for hierarchical graph structures that grow exponentially, enabling efficient algebraic operations and applications in fields like machine learning and multigrid methods.

Method: Defines graph lineages with hierarchical growth, bipartite connections, and prolongation maps. Introduces skeletal algebraic operations and unary operators like thickening and escalation.

Result: Develops an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and graph lineages, with applications in deep neural networks and multigrid methods.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for hierarchical model architectures and local algorithms, with demonstrated utility in machine learning and computational science.

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

TL;DR: PnP-DA is a Plug-and-Play data assimilation method combining gradient-based updates with a pretrained generative prior, outperforming classical methods by reducing forecast errors without restrictive statistical assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth system modeling faces challenges in capturing multiscale dynamics and minimizing forecast errors. Conventional data assimilation methods assume Gaussian errors, which fail for chaotic systems.

Method: PnP-DA alternates between a gradient-based analysis update and a forward pass through a pretrained generative prior, avoiding backpropagation through complex networks.

Result: Experiments show PnP-DA reduces forecast errors across various observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Conclusion: PnP-DA offers a flexible, efficient approach to data assimilation by leveraging historical data and relaxing restrictive assumptions, improving forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally
efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary
simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system
suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate
these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model
forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error
statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic
dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates
(1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance
misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained
generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional
Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions
and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization
functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the
complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles.
Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy
consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities
and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores machine-learned potentials for simulating hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions in peptides, benchmarking graph neural networks (MACE, SchNet, Allegro) and demonstrating MACE's superior accuracy for predicting reaction barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding HAT reactions in biological systems is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at large scales, which traditional methods cannot provide.

Method: The study systematically generates HAT configurations in peptides using semiempirical methods and DFT, then benchmarks three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, MACE) for learning potential energy surfaces and predicting reaction barriers.

Result: MACE outperforms other models, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on DFT barrier predictions, enabling large-scale simulations of HAT in collagen.

Conclusion: The approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, offering a pathway for quantum-accurate simulations of reactivity in complex environments.

Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological
processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic
pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to
the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,
neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.
Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy
surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to
generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions
in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.
Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large
datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural
network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT
PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE
consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,
achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT
barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into
large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted
barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in
peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance
trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials
with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is
generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate
simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inaccuracies in standard DFT calculations for InSb, particularly non-physical band inversions and incorrect band gaps caused by 5p-4d repulsion and self-interaction errors.

Method: Combines hybrid HSE XC functionals, MBPT via G0W0, and DFT+U, with Bayesian optimization for parameter refinement.

Result: Achieves precise band gaps, bulk moduli, effective masses, and other properties, matching experimental data closely.

Conclusion: The method resolves long-standing issues in InSb's electronic structure and provides a transferable framework for other materials, aiding future applications.

Abstract: This study presents a refined approach to computing the electronic structure
of indium antimonide (InSb) using advanced \textit{ab initio} techniques with
the In and Sb $4d^{10}$ semicore electrons included in the valence states.
These states are modeled using fully relativistic projector augmented waves
(PAW) and optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt (ONCV) pseudopotentials.
However, standard Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with
these pseudopotentials often produce non-physical band inversions and incorrect
band gaps at the $\Gamma$-point due to $5p$-$4d$ repulsion and self-interaction
errors (SIE). To resolve these issues, we apply a combination of hybrid
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT) via quasiparticle $G_0W_0$, and DFT+$U$,
significantly improving the accuracy of the band structure over previous
studies. A Bayesian optimization framework is used to refine key parameters,
including the inverse screening length ($\mu$) and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange
fraction ($\alpha$) in HSE-based XC functionals, as well as the Hubbard $U$
parameters in DFT+$U$, leading to significantly improved band structure
predictions. This approach yields highly precise band gaps, bulk moduli,
effective masses, Luttinger parameters, valence bandwidth, and $4d$ band
positions, achieving unprecedented agreement with experimental data. The
resulting model resolves the long-standing incomplete description of InSb's
electronic band structure and provides a transferable computational framework
for accurate electronic structure predictions across diverse material systems,
offering valuable insights for future electronic, optoelectronic, energy, and
quantum applications.

### [36] [$C^1$ invariant and inertial manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00165)
*Radosław Czaja,Piotr Kalita*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper extends Carvalho et al.'s work on non-autonomous inertial manifolds by addressing the sharp gap condition and proving $C^1$ regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and refine the Lyapunov-Perron construction of invariant and inertial manifolds, focusing on non-autonomous systems and sharp conditions.

Method: Extends Carvalho et al.'s framework by incorporating the gap condition and analyzing regularity.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of non-autonomous inertial manifolds under sharp conditions and proves their $C^1$ regularity.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of inertial manifolds by confirming their smoothness and applicability under stringent conditions.

Abstract: Recent article by Carvalho et al. [J. Differential Equations 416 (2025)]
presents in a~unified framework the Lyapunov--Perron construction of invariant
and inertial manifolds together with the saddle point property. We extend their
results on the existence of non-autonomous inertial manifolds by considering
the gap condition which is known to be sharp. Moreover, we show that the
constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.

### [37] [On the controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on multi-dimensional cylindrical domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00812)
*Víctor Hernández-Santamaría,Subrata Majumdar*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper studies null controllability of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation on a cylindrical domain, proving controllability under specific conditions and providing explicit control cost estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the controllability of the KS equation, a model for complex spatiotemporal dynamics, on cylindrical domains, addressing both linearized and nonlinear systems.

Method: Combines the method of moments and Lebeau-Robbiano strategy for linearized system controllability, and the source term method with Banach fixed point theorem for nonlinear cases.

Result: Proves null controllability under specific conditions, including minimal time thresholds and algebraic properties of domain parameters, with explicit control cost estimates.

Conclusion: The KS equation is null controllable under certain conditions, with controllability dependent on time and domain properties, extending to local nonlinear cases in lower dimensions.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate null controllability of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation on a cylindrical domain
$\Omega=\Omega_x\times \Omega_y$ in $\mathbb R^N$, where $\Omega_x=(0,a),$
$a>0$ and $\Omega_y$ is a smooth domain in $\mathbb R^{N-1}$. We first study
the controllability of this system by a control acting on $\{0\}\times \omega$,
$\omega\subset \Omega_y$, through the boundary term associated with the
Laplacian component. The null controllability of the linearized system is
proved using a combination of two techniques: the method of moments and
Lebeau-Robbiano strategy. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
the null controllability of this system along with an explicit control cost
estimate. Furthermore, we show that there exists minimal time $T_0(x_0)>0$ such
that the system is null controllable for all time $T > T_0(x_0)$ by means of an
interior control exerted on $\gamma = \{x_0\} \times \omega \subset \Omega$,
where $x_0/a\in (0,1)\setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and it is not controllable if
$T<T_0(x_0).$
  If we assume $x_0/a$ is an algebraic real number of order $d > 1$, then we
prove the controllability for any time $T>0.$
  Finally, for the case of $N=2 \text{ or } 3$, we show the local null
controllability of the main nonlinear system by employing the source term
method followed by the Banach fixed point theorem.

### [38] [An analytic approach to the stress energy tensor in quantum field theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00487)
*Alexander Strohmaier*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: A framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes uses a stress-energy tensor as a connection one-form, replacing symmetries in Minkowski theory. The Klein-Gordon field in a Fock representation exemplifies this, with smooth scattering matrices for metric perturbations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize quantum field theory to curved spacetimes without relying on symmetries, using a stress-energy tensor as a connection one-form.

Method: Proposes a framework where the stress-energy tensor acts as a connection one-form on a moduli space of metrics. Demonstrates with the Klein-Gordon field in a Fock representation.

Result: Shows the local time-slice property and implementability of local isometries. Proves smooth scattering matrices exist for compact metric perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generalizes quantum field theory to curved spacetimes, extending results by Dimock and Wald.

Abstract: We discuss a framework for quantum fields in curved spacetimes that possess a
stress energy tensor as a connection one form on a suitable moduli space of
metrics. In generic spacetimes the existence of such a tensor is thought to be
a replacement for the existence of symmetries that the Minkowski theory relies
on. It is shown that the local time-slice property and the implementability of
local isometries is a consequence of the existence of a stress energy tensor
that is a local field. We prove that the Klein-Gordon field, in an irreducible
Fock representation in which the ground state is Hadamard, is an example. In
this example we show that the scattering matrix for compactly supported metric
perturbations exists in the Fock space and is smooth on a dense set with
respect to the perturbation parameter. This generalises results by Dimock and
Wald.
