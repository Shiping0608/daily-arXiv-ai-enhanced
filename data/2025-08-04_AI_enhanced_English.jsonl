Subsequent simplifications of this\nrepresentation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a\nsmaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the\nproof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron\nnetworks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical\ndirection of most modern neural networks.\n  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an\nalternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear\nactivations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis\nspline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and\nsigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works\nhave explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we\npropose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in\nthe Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of\nlearnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and\nSprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced\nconstant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity.
