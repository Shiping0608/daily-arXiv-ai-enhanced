Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on\nstructured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of\nany data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric\nfidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with\ncomplex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder\nfluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car\nexternal aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for\nreal-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit\nmodels (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps\ncompared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to\n200 times during inference without compromising accuracy.

These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while\npreserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper\nprovides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a\nLyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output\nerror bounds for the reduced order models.

A non-monotone\nline search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is\nalso adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which,\ntogether with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost\nsavings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an\nadditional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems,\nto a more general class with non-linear constraints.
