Abstract: Error estimates are proved for an evolving surface finite element

$H^1$-norm with optimal-order for finite elements of degree at least two.
Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and complement our
theoretical results.

### [2] [Error estimates of linear decoupled structure-preserving incremental viscosity splitting methods for the Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01141)
*Baolin Kuang,Hongfei Fu,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Proposed efficient first- and second-order schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model using IVS, ensuring linearity, decoupling, and unconditional energy dissipation. Error analysis confirms optimal convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop computationally efficient and easy-to-implement numerical schemes for the coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model while preserving physical properties like mass conservation and energy dissipation.

Method: Combines scalar auxiliary variable method and zero-energy-contribution approach with IVS, solving constant-coefficient and linear equations per time step.

Result: Schemes are uniquely solvable, mass-conserving, and unconditionally energy-dissipative. Error analysis shows optimal convergence rates.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes are accurate, effective, and efficient, validated by numerical examples and rigorous theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We propose first- and second-order time discretization schemes for the
coupled Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes model, leveraging the incremental
viscosity splitting (IVS) method. The schemes combine the scalar auxiliary
variable method and the zero-energy-contribution approach, resulting in a
linear, decoupled numerical framework. At each time step, they only require to
solve a sequence of constant-coefficient equations, along with a linear
equation with one unknown, making the algorithms computationally efficient and
easy to implement. In addition, the proposed schemes are proven to be uniquely
solvable, mass-conserving, and unconditional energy dissipation. Most
importantly, leveraging the mathematical induction method and the regularity
properties of the Stokes equation, we perform a rigorous error analysis for the
first-order scheme in multiple space dimensions, establishing an unconditional
and optimal convergence rate for all relevant variables under different norms.
A user-defined, time-dependent parameter plays an important role in the error
analysis of the proposed structure-preserving IVS methods. Ample numerical
examples are carried out to verify the theoretical findings and to demonstrate
the accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of explicit implementation details for WF spline interpolation, despite existing theoretical coverage.

Method: Implement WF spline interpolation, derive error estimates, and use numerical experiments to evaluate solution transfer.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of WF spline space, improved conservation via adaptive quadrature rules, and qualitative visualization properties.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in WF spline implementation and validates its practical utility in solution transfer.

Abstract: This work primarily focuses on providing full implementation details for
Worsey-Farin (WF) spline interpolation over tetrahedral elements. While this
spline space is not new and the theory has been covered in other works, there
is a lack of explicit and comprehensive implementation details, which we hope
to provide. In this paper, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the
WF-spline space through a simple target application: solution transfer.
Moreover, we derive an error estimate for the WF spline-based, solution
transfer process. We conduct numerical experiments quantifying the conservative
nature and order of accuracy of the transfer process, and we present a
qualitative evaluation of the visualization properties of the smoothed
solution. Additionally, in our study of conservation, we demonstrate how
adaptive numerical quadrature rules on the tetrahedron used in conjunction with
global L2-projection can improve the conservation of the solution transfer
process.

### [4] [Finite element conformal complexes in three dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01238)
*Xuehai Huang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends the BGG framework to construct finite element conformal Hessian and elasticity complexes in 3D, using conformal tensors and higher-order operators. A novel discrete BGG approach simplifies constructions, leading to stable numerical methods for various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop finite element conformal complexes for applications in relativity, Cosserat elasticity, and fluid mechanics, addressing the need for stable and structure-preserving numerical methods.

Method: Extends the BGG framework to incorporate conformal tensors and higher-order operators. Introduces a discrete BGG approach with geometric decomposition of bubble spaces and reduction operations for simpler constructions.

Result: Systematically develops finite element conformal Hessian and elasticity complexes with varying smoothness, supporting stable numerical methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework simplifies constructions and enables stable, structure-preserving numerical methods for diverse applications.

Abstract: This paper extends the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework to the
construction of finite element conformal Hessian complexes and conformal
elasticity complexes in three dimensions involving conformal tensors (i.e.,
symmetric and traceless tensors). These complexes incorporate higher-order
differential operators, including the linearized Cotton-York operator, and
require conformal tensor spaces with nontrivial smoothness and trace
conditions. A novel application of the discrete BGG framework, combined with
the geometric decomposition of bubble spaces and a reduction operation, to
local bubble finite element complexes is introduced. This yields simpler and
more tractable constructions than global BGG-based approaches, and leads to the
bubble conformal complexes. Building on these bubble conformal complexes and
the associated face bubble complexes, finite element conformal Hessian
complexes and conformal elasticity complexes with varying degrees of smoothness
are systematically developed. The resulting complexes support stable and
structure-preserving numerical methods for applications in relativity, Cosserat
elasticity, and fluid mechanics.

Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately modeling miscible displacement with high-order accuracy in both time and space.

Method: Uses a multi-time-step strategy for concentration and velocity/pressure, and compact block-centered finite difference for spatial discretization.

Result: The scheme achieves second-order temporal and fourth-order spatial accuracy, with proven existence and uniqueness. Numerical tests confirm its performance.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is effective, as demonstrated by theoretical proofs and numerical experiments, including verification of viscous fingering.

Abstract: In this paper, a two-dimensional incompressible miscible displacement model
is considered, and a novel decoupled and linearized high-order finite
difference scheme is developed, by utilizing the multi-time-step strategy to
treat the different time evolutions of concentration and velocity/pressure, and
the compact block-centered finite difference approximation for spatial
discretization. We show that the scheme is mass-conserving, and has
second-order temporal accuracy and fourth-order spatial accuracy for the
concentration, the velocity and the pressure simultaneously. The existence and
uniqueness of the developed scheme under a rough time-step condition is also
proved following the convergence results. Numerical experiments are presented
to confirm the theoretical conclusions. Besides, some 'real' simulations are
also tested to show good performance of the proposed scheme, in particular, the
viscous fingering phenomenon is verified.

Conclusion: The algorithm outperforms Monte Carlo methods, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: A novel and efficient algorithm based on the Wiener chaos expansion is
proposed for the stochastic Maxwell equations driven by Wiener process. The
proposed algorithm can reduce the original stochastic system to the
deterministic case and separate the randomness in the computation. Therefore,
it can yield a significant improvement of efficiency and lead to less
computational errors compared to the Monte Carlo method, since the statistics
of the solution can be solved directly without repeating over many
realizations. In particular, the proposed algorithm could inherit the
multi-symplecticity. Numerical experiments are dedicated to performing the
efficiency and accuracy of the Wiener chaos expansion algorithm.

### [7] [PGD-based local surrogate models via overlapping domain decomposition: a computational comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01313)
*Marco Discacciati,Ben J. Evans,Matteo Giacomini*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient method for constructing physics-based local surrogate models for parametric linear elliptic problems using PGD and DD, achieving significant speed-ups and real-time evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational complexity of parametric linear elliptic problems by reducing dimensionality and decoupling spatial degrees of freedom.

Method: Combines proper generalized decomposition (PGD) for dimensionality reduction and overlapping domain decomposition (DD) to decouple spatial degrees of freedom. Uses non-intrusive computation in the offline phase and an algebraic alternating Schwarz method in the online phase.

Result: Achieves speed-ups up to 100 times compared to previous methods and enables real-time evaluation (less than half a second).

Conclusion: The proposed methodology outperforms existing PGD-based local surrogate models in both offline and online phases, as demonstrated by numerical benchmarks.

Abstract: An efficient strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for
parametric linear elliptic problems is presented. The method relies on proper
generalized decomposition (PGD) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and
on an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) strategy to decouple the spatial
degrees of freedom. In the offline phase, the local surrogate model is computed
in a non-intrusive way, exploiting the linearity of the operator and imposing
arbitrary Dirichlet conditions, independently at each node of the interface, by
means of the traces of the finite element functions employed for the
discretization inside the subdomain. This leads to parametric subproblems with
reduced dimensionality, significantly decreasing the complexity of the involved
computations and achieving speed-ups up to 100 times with respect to a
previously proposed DD-PGD algorithm that required clustering the interface
nodes. A fully algebraic alternating Schwarz method is then formulated to
couple the subdomains in the online phase, leveraging the real-time (less than
half a second) evaluation capabilities of the computed local surrogate models,
that do not require the solution of any additional low-dimensional problems. A
computational comparison of different PGD-based local surrogate models is
presented using a set of numerical benchmarks to showcase the superior
performance of the proposed methodology, both in the offline and in the online
phase.

Abstract: We suggest a new method of basis construction for the kernel of a linear form
on the Laurent polynomial module related to multivariate wavelets, and
demonstrate its applications to box spline prewavelets, leading to small mask
supports for $C^1$ cubic and $C^2$ quartic box splines in two variables,
outperforming previously known constructions, and to trivariate piecewise
linear prewavelets with at most 23 nozero mask coefficients.

Conclusion: XI-PINN is an effective, robust, and versatile method for solving moving interface problems, outperforming traditional PINN approaches.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful class of

innovative Extended Interface Physics-Informed Neural Network (XI-PINN)
framework specifically designed to solve parabolic moving interface problems.
The proposed approach incorporates a level set function to characterize the

solution. We conduct a rigorous a priori error analysis for the XI-PINN method,
providing error bounds for the approximation. Leveraging the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) theory, we further demonstrate that XI-PINN achieves a faster
training convergence rate compared to conventional PINN approaches. The
method's versatility is further demonstrated by its application to the Oseen
equations. We perform comprehensive numerical experiments to validate the
efficacy, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed framework.

*Lei Zhang,Xiangcheng Zheng,Shangqin Zhu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Numerical analysis of computing transition states for semilinear elliptic PDEs using high-index saddle dynamics, focusing on index-1 case. Proposes continuous-in-space formulation, analyzes well-posedness, stability, and error estimates for finite element schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge saddle dynamics and numerical PDE methods, improving compatibility and accuracy for semilinear elliptic problems.

Method: Proposes continuous-in-space saddle dynamics formulation, analyzes semi- and fully-discrete finite element schemes, addressing coupling, nonlinearity, nonlocality, and norm constraints.

Result: Demonstrates well-posedness, stability, and error estimates, confirming accuracy and index-preservation of discrete schemes.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for numerical computation of transition states in semilinear elliptic PDEs, ensuring compatibility and accuracy.

Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of computing transition states of
semilinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) via the high-index
saddle dynamics at the index-1 case, or equivalently, the gentlest ascent
dynamics. To establish clear connections between saddle dynamics and numerical
methods of PDEs, as well as improving their compatibility, we first propose the
continuous-in-space formulation of saddle dynamics for semilinear elliptic
problems. This formulation yields a parabolic system that converges to saddle
points. We then analyze the well-posedness, $H^1$ stability and error estimates
of semi- and fully-discrete finite element schemes. Significant efforts are
devoted to addressing the coupling, gradient nonlinearity, nonlocality of the
proposed parabolic system, and the impacts of retraction due to the norm
constraint. The error estimate results demonstrate the accuracy and
index-preservation of the discrete schemes.

*Wing Tat Leung,Qiuqi Li,Songwei Liu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A randomized generalized multiscale finite element method (Randomized GMsFEM) is proposed for flow problems with high-contrast media and parameterized inputs, offering efficient and accurate approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of flow problems in high-contrast heterogeneous media with parameterized inputs, requiring accurate and efficient computational methods.

Method: The method uses a data-driven predictor in two stages: offline (snapshot space generation via spectral decompositions and SVD) and online (evaluation of eigenfunctions for new parameters).

Result: The Randomized GMsFEM provides superior performance over traditional GMsFEM, demonstrated through numerical examples and rigorous convergence analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles complex permeability fields and multiscale information, offering a robust solution for flow problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a randomized generalized multiscale finite element
method (Randomized GMsFEM) for flow problems with parameterized inputs and
high-contrast heterogeneous media. The method employs a data-driven predictor
to construct multiscale basis functions in two stages: offline and online. In
the offline stage, a snapshot space is generated via spectral decompositions,
and a reduced matrix is obtained using SVD to predict eigenfunctions. In the
online stage, these eigenfunctions are evaluated for new parameter realizations
to construct the multiscale space. Furthermore, our approach addresses the
complexity of multiple permeability fields with random inputs and multiple
multiscale information, providing accurate and efficient approximations.
Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for our Randomized GMsFEM.
Finally, we present extensive numerical examples, demonstrating its superior

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve stochastic control problems without spatial discretization, leveraging neural networks for scalability and accuracy.

Result: Scalable, accurate, and robust performance on high-dimensional linear-quadratic and nonlinear control tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses entropy-regularized stochastic control problems, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework based on physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) for solving entropy-regularized stochastic control
problems. The method iteratively alternates between soft policy evaluation and
improvement using automatic differentiation and neural approximation, without
relying on spatial discretization. We present a detailed $L^2$ error analysis
that decomposes the total approximation error into three sources: iteration
error, policy network error, and PDE residual error. The proposed algorithm is
validated with a range of challenging control tasks, including high-dimensional
linear-quadratic regulation in 5D and 10D, as well as nonlinear systems such as
pendulum and cartpole problems. Numerical results confirm the scalability,
accuracy, and robustness of our approach across both linear and nonlinear
benchmarks.

### [14] [On the normalization of trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01817)
*Hendrik Speleers*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces normalization methods for trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines to ensure they form a partition of unity, enabling control polygons with convex hull properties. It also demonstrates their application in representing circles and approximating curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines lack partition of unity and convex hull properties, limiting their design utility. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The authors derive explicit expressions for normalization and propose a recursive algorithm to compute normalization weights. They apply these to represent circles and test approximation capabilities.

Result: The normalized B-splines achieve partition of unity and convex hull properties. They successfully represent circles and demonstrate strong approximation power.

Conclusion: The normalization methods enhance the usability of trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines for design and approximation tasks, as validated by their application in curve representation.

Abstract: Trigonometric and hyperbolic B-splines can be computed via recurrence
relations analogous to the classical polynomial B-splines. However, in their
original formulation, these two types of B-splines do not form a partition of
unity and consequently do not admit the notion of control polygons with the
convex hull property for design purposes. In this paper, we look into explicit
expressions for their normalization and provide a recursive algorithm to
compute the corresponding normalization weights. As example application, we
consider the exact representation of a circle in terms of $C^{2n-1}$
trigonometric B-splines of order $m=2n+1\geq3$, with a variable number of
control points. We also illustrate the approximation power of trigonometric and
hyperbolic splines.

### [15] [Non-self-adjoint sixth-order eigenvalue problems arising from clamped elastic thin films on closed domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01952)
*N C Papanicolaou,I C Christov*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A sixth-order BVP for elastic thin-film flows is solved using a Petrov-Galerkin spectral method with biorthogonal eigenfunctions, achieving rapid convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sixth-order BVPs in thin-film flows with elastic interfaces, which require accurate solutions for infinitesimal deformations.

Method: Construct odd and even eigenfunctions for the non-self-adjoint EVP, solve the adjoint EVP for biorthogonal sets, and apply a Petrov-Galerkin spectral method.

Result: The method yields solutions in excellent agreement with exact results, with convergence rates exceeding sixth-order.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral method is effective for sixth-order BVPs, offering high accuracy and rapid convergence.

Abstract: Sixth-order boundary value problems (BVPs) arise in thin-film flows with a
surface that has elastic bending resistance. We consider the case in which the
elastic interface is clamped at the lateral walls of a closed trough and thus
encloses a finite amount of fluid. For a slender film undergoing infinitesimal
deformations, the displacement of the elastic surface from its initial
equilibrium position obeys a sixth-order (in space) initial boundary value
problem (IBVP). To solve this IBVP, we construct a set of odd and even
eigenfunctions that intrinsically satisfy the boundary conditions (BCs) of the
original IBVP. These eigenfunctions are the solutions of a non-self-adjoint
sixth-order eigenvalue problem (EVP). To use the eigenfunctions for series
expansions, we also construct and solve the adjoint EVP, leading to another set
of even and odd eigenfunctions, which are orthogonal to the original set
(biorthogonal). The eigenvalues of the adjoint EVP are the same as those of the
original EVP, and we find accurate asymptotic formulas for them. Next,
employing the biorthogonal sets of eigenfunctions, a Petrov--Galerkin spectral
method for sixth-order problems is proposed, which can also handle lower-order
terms in the IBVP. The proposed method is tested on two model sixth-order BVPs,
which admit exact solutions. We explicitly derive all the necessary formulas
for expanding the quantities that appear in the model problems into the set(s)
of eigenfunctions. For both model problems, we find that the approximate
Petrov--Galerkin spectral solution is in excellent agreement with the exact
solution. The convergence rate of the spectral series is rapid, exceeding the
expected sixth-order algebraic rate.

### [16] [Convergence Analysis of Optimal SOR for a Class of Consistently Ordered 2-Cyclic Matrices with Complex Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02052)
*L. Robert Hocking,Chen Greif*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the convergence analysis of optimal SOR for linear systems with complex Jacobi spectra, revealing phase-dependent convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on real Jacobi spectra, but complex spectra, common in physical applications, lacked detailed convergence analysis.

Method: Uses complex analysis techniques to derive convergence rates for optimal SOR with complex Jacobi spectra.

Result: Convergence rates in the complex case depend on both the distance to 1 and the phase of the right-hand endpoint.

Conclusion: The study fills a gap in the literature by providing a detailed convergence analysis for complex Jacobi spectra, highlighting phase's role in convergence.

Abstract: Asymptotic rates of convergence of optimal SOR applied to linear systems with
consistently ordered 2-cyclic matrices have been extensively studied in the
case where the Jacobi eigenvalues are are real and contained in an interval
centered at the origin. It is well known that as the rightmost endpoint of the
interval approaches $1$ from below, optimal SOR converges an order of magnitude
faster than Jacobi. We generalize this to the situation where the Jacobi
spectrum is contained in a line segment in the complex plane that is symmetric
about the origin. This is an important class of linear systems, which arise
often in various physical applications; complex-shifted linear systems are
included in this family. Optimal relaxation parameters are known in this case,
but a detailed convergence analysis does not seem to exist in the literature.
Using techniques of complex analysis, we derive convergence rates, finding that
in the complex case they are affected not only by the distance to 1 of the
right-hand endpoint of the line segment as in the real case, but also by its
phase.

Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce an abstract framework to solve the
eigenvalue problem by weak Galerkin (WG) method. By the application of the
framework, WG method is proved to be locking-free and gives asymptotic lower

property for Crouzeix-Raviart (CR) element as an extensional work. In the end,
we present some numerical experiments to support the theoretical results.

nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz equation with rough coefficients, including
non-periodicity and nonseparable scales. Direct numerical resolution of such
multiscale problems on fine meshes incurs prohibitive computational costs. To
address this challenge, we propose an efficient coarse scale approximation
through localized basis functions derived from energy minimization within the
Generalized Rough Polyharmonic Splines (GRPS) framework. These basis functions
preserve critical multiscale features while operating on a computationally
tractable coarse mesh. The nonlinear, vectorial, and non-symmetric nature of
the Landau-Lifshitz equation necessitates careful design of variational
formulations for basis construction. We introduce several such formulations,
each tailored to specific structural aspects of the problem. Through systematic
numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant
computational savings without compromising accuracy, offering a robust
framework for simulating multiscale magnetic systems with complex
microstructures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the weak Galerkin method while preserving its beneficial properties.

Method: A two-grid weak Galerkin method with optimized parameters and an enriched Crouzeix-Raviart scheme.

Result: Doubled convergence rate and maintained asymptotic lower bounds; the ECR scheme provided lower bounds for eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance performance and maintain theoretical guarantees for the weak Galerkin method and eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a two-gird skill to accelerate the weak Galerkin
method. By the proper use of parameters, the two-grid weak Galerkin method not

enriched Crouzeix-Raviart (ECR) scheme, which can also provide lower bounds for
the linear elastic eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive Crouzeix-Raviart finite element method for solving the first Dirichlet eigenpair of the p-Laplacian problem, proving convergence and vanishing error estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately computing the first Dirichlet eigenpair of the p-Laplacian problem using adaptive finite element methods.

Method: An adaptive Crouzeix-Raviart finite element method is proposed, with analysis focusing on error estimators and convergence properties.

Result: The error estimators vanish, and approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions converge to their continuous counterparts under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The method is theoretically sound and numerically effective, as demonstrated by the results.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze an adaptive Crouzeix-Raviart finite
element method for computing the first Dirichlet eigenpair of the $p$-Laplacian
problem. We prove that the sequence of error estimators produced by the
adaptive algorithm has a vanishing limit and that, starting from a fine initial
mesh, the relevant sequence of approximate eigenvalues converges to the first
eigenvalue and the distance in a mesh-dependent broken norm between discrete
eigenfunctions and the set composed of relevant continuous eigenfunctions also
tends to zero. The analysis hinges on establishing a compactness property for
Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements over a sequence of adaptively generated
meshes, which represents key theoretical challenges and novelties. We present
numerical results to illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper explores fully implicit timestepping methods for atmosphere/ocean simulation, highlighting their stability, energy conservation, and avoidance of splitting errors. It investigates their viability using implicit Runge-Kutta methods and compares them to a benchmark splitting method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in geophysical fluid dynamics by leveraging the advantages of fully implicit timestepping methods, such as unconditional stability and energy conservation, while overcoming solver difficulties.

Method: Uses overlapping Additive Schwarz methods for solving coupled systems and the Irksome package for automated code generation of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Compares schemes with an implicit/explicit splitting benchmark (ARK2).

Result: Provides insights into the accuracy and efficiency of implicit Runge-Kutta methods for atmosphere/ocean simulation.

Conclusion: The study offers a preliminary assessment of the viability of implicit Runge-Kutta methods in this context, suggesting potential but requiring further investigation.

Abstract: Fully implicit timestepping methods have several potential advantages for
atmosphere/ocean simulation. First, being unconditionally stable, they degrade
more gracefully as the Courant number increases, typically requiring more
solver iterations rather than suddenly blowing up. Second, particular choices
of implicit timestepping methods can extend energy conservation properties of
spatial discretisations to the fully discrete method. Third, these methods
avoid issues related to splitting errors that can occur in some situations, and
avoid the complexities of splitting methods. Fully implicit timestepping
methods have had limited application in geophysical fluid dynamics due to
challenges of finding suitable iterative solvers, since the coupled treatment
of advection prevents the standard elimination techniques. However, overlapping
Additive Schwarz methods, provide a robust, scalable iterative approach for
solving the monolithic coupled system for all fields and Runge-Kutta stages. In
this study we investigate this approach applied to the rotating shallow water
equations, facilitated by the Irksome package which provides automated code
generation for implicit Runge-Kutta methods. We compare various schemes in
terms of accuracy and efficiency using an implicit/explicit splitting method,
namely the ARK2 scheme of Giraldo et al (2013), as a benchmark. This provides
an initial look at whether implicit Runge-Kutta methods can be viable for
atmosphere and ocean simulation.

Motivation: To improve accuracy and efficiency in solving ODE systems by leveraging structural relations and block computations.

Conclusion: The method effectively solves ODE systems with improved accuracy and spectral properties.

Abstract: We design and analyse a new numerical method to solve ODE system based on the
structural method. We compute approximations of solutions together with its
derivatives up to order $K$ by solving an entire block corresponding to $R$
time steps. We build the physical relations that connect the function and
derivative approximations at each time step by using the ODE and its

relations between the function and its derivative over the whole block of $R$
times steps. The non-linear system is solved and provide very accurate
approximations with nice spectral resolution properties.

TL;DR: Analysis of a coupled 3D-2D model with Stokes flow and poroelastic plate, proving solvability and proposing a stable virtual element method with optimal convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique solvability and numerical approximation of a coupled fluid-poroelastic system, relevant for applications like immune isolation simulations.

Method: Uses Fredholm's theory and Babuska--Brezzi approach for solvability; proposes a virtual element method with Fortin interpolant for discrete stability.

Result: Proves well-posedness and optimal convergence; validates with computational experiments and applies to immune isolation simulation.

Conclusion: The method is theoretically and numerically effective for simulating coupled fluid-poroelastic systems, with practical applications.

Abstract: We analyse a coupled 3D-2D model with a free fluid governed by Stokes flow in
the bulk and a poroelastic plate described by the Biot-Kirchhoff equations on
the surface. Assuming the form of a double perturbed saddle-point problem, the
unique solvability of the continuous formulation is proved using Fredholm's
theory for compact operators and the Babuska--Brezzi approach for saddle-point
problems with penalty. We propose a stable virtual element method, establishing
a discrete inf-sup condition under a small mesh assumption through a Fortin
interpolant that requires only $H^1$-regularity for the Stokes problem. We show
the well-posedness of the monolithic discrete formulation and introduce an
equivalent fixed-point approach employed at the implementation level. The
optimal convergence of the method in the energy norm is proved theoretically
and is also confirmed numerically via computational experiments. We demonstrate
an application of the model and the proposed scheme in the simulation of immune
isolation using encapsulation with silicon nanopore membranes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Green-Jacobi preconditioner to improve the performance of FFT-based solvers for microstructures with smooth, high-contrast coefficients, demonstrating its effectiveness in linear elastic problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFT-based solvers lose efficiency for microstructures with smooth, high-contrast coefficients, necessitating a better preconditioner.

Method: Proposes a Green-Jacobi preconditioner, an enhanced version of the standard discrete Green preconditioner, maintaining quasilinear complexity.

Result: The Jacobi-accelerated FFT (J-FFT) solver reduces iteration counts in conjugate gradient methods for high-contrast problems.

Conclusion: The J-FFT solver is effective for problems like phase-field fracture simulations and topology optimization, where material properties vary smoothly.

Abstract: The computational efficiency and rapid convergence of fast Fourier transform
(FFT)-based solvers render them a powerful numerical tool for periodic cell
problems in multiscale modeling. On regular grids, they tend to outperform
traditional numerical methods. However, we show that their convergence slows
down significantly when applied to microstructures with smooth,
highly-contrasted coefficients. To address this loss of performance, we
introduce a Green-Jacobi preconditioner, an enhanced successor to the standard
discrete Green preconditioner that preserves the quasilinear complexity,
$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, of conventional FFT-based solvers. Through numerical
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Jacobi-accelerated FFT
(J-FFT) solver within a linear elastic framework. For problems characterized by
smooth data and high material contrast, J-FFT significantly reduces the
iteration count of the conjugate gradient method compared to the standard Green
preconditioner. These findings are particularly relevant for phase-field
fracture simulations, density-based topology optimization, and solvers that use
adaption of the grid, which all introduce smooth variations in the material
properties that challenge conventional FFT-based solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of superfluous solutions in Navier-Stokes equations and ensure useful local pressure expansions.

Method: Proving representation via transgalilean transformations for weak solutions in a specific class.

Result: A powerful representation theorem for solutions and a sufficient condition for local pressure expansion.

Conclusion: The work provides a structural understanding and practical condition for solutions in Navier-Stokes equations.

Abstract: The existence of superfluous solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the
whole space implies that not all solutions with uniformly locally bounded
energy satisfy a useful local pressure expansion. We prove that every weak
solution in a parabolic uniformly local $L^2$ class can be obtained as a
transgalilean transformation of a solution satisfying the local pressure
expansion in a distributional sense. This gives a powerful representation
theorem for a large class of solutions. We use this structure to obtain a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing NLS with almost periodic initial data, overcoming challenges like additional degrees of freedom and commuting flows in the NLS hierarchy.

Method: Combines direct spectral theory (proving pure a.c. spectrum, spectral gaps, and thickness conditions for Dirac operators) and inverse spectral theory (proving existence, almost periodicity, and uniqueness of solutions).

Result: For small analytic quasiperiodic initial data with Diophantine conditions, the Cauchy problem admits a unique, almost periodic solution in space and time.

Conclusion: The study successfully resolves the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing NLS with almost periodic initial data, leveraging spectral theory to handle the NLS hierarchy's complexities.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Cauchy problem for the cubic defocusing nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with almost periodic initial data. We prove that
for small analytic quasiperiodic initial data satisfying Diophantine frequency
conditions, the Cauchy problem admits a solution that is almost periodic in
both space and time, and that this solution is unique among solutions locally
bounded in a suitable sense. The analysis combines direct and inverse spectral
theory.
  In the inverse spectral theory part, we prove existence, almost periodicity,
and uniqueness for solutions with initial data whose associated Dirac operator
has purely a.c.\ spectrum that is not too thin. This resolves novel challenges
presented by the NLS hierarchy, such as an additional degree of freedom and an
additional commuting flow.
  In the direct spectral theory part, for Dirac operators with small analytic
quasiperiodic potentials with Diophantine frequency conditions, we prove pure
a.c.\ spectrum, exponentially decaying spectral gaps, and spectral thickness
conditions (homogeneity and Craig-type conditions).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Dirichlet problem for a semi-linear elliptic equation with mixed operators, focusing on weak solutions' existence, multiplicity, and regularity.

Method: Uses Linking Theorem, Mountain Pass Theorem, and Fountain Theorem for existence and multiplicity. Proves regularity via $L^{\infty}$-boundedness and $C^{2, \alpha}$-regularity.

Result: Existence of non-trivial weak solutions for different eigenvalue conditions, infinitely many solutions under symmetry, and regularity up to $C^{2, \alpha}$.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive results on weak solutions for the mixed operator problem, including existence, multiplicity, and regularity.

Abstract: We study the existence, multiplicity and regularity results of weak solutions
for the Dirichlet problem of a semi-linear elliptic equation driven by the
mixture of the usual Laplacian and fractional Laplacian
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{%
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u + (-\Delta)^{s} u+ a(x)\ u =f(x,u) & \hbox{in $\Omega$,}
  u=0 & \hbox{in $\mathbb{R}^n\backslash\Omega$}
  \end{array}%
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $s \in (0,1)$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a bounded domain, the
coefficient $a$ is a function of $x$ and the subcritical nonlinearity $f(x,u)$
has superlinear growth at zero and infinity.
  We show the existence of a non-trivial weak solution by Linking Theorem and
Mountain Pass Theorem respectively for $\lambda_{1} \leqslant 0$ and
$\lambda_{1} > 0$, where $\lambda_{1}$ denotes the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta
+ (-\Delta)^{s} +a(x)$.
  In particular, adding a symmetric condition to $f$, we obtain infinitely many
solutions via Fountain Theorem.
  Moreover, for the regularity part, we first prove the
$L^{\infty}$-boundedness of weak solutions and then establish up to $C^{2,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the global well-posedness of the fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equation, focusing on the subcritical nature and the role of the fractional Laplacian.

Method: Uses the $I$-method to control the $H^s(\mathbb{T})$-norm of solutions with infinite energy initial data, supported by improved long-time linear and bilinear Strichartz estimates on the rescaled torus.

Result: Global well-posedness is proven for $s \geq \frac{1-\alpha}{2}$, with the threshold conjectured to be sharp due to pseudo-Galilean symmetry.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the global well-posedness of the equation, leveraging the $I$-method and Strichartz estimates, and suggests the sharpness of the derived threshold.

Abstract: We consider the defocusing periodic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation
  $$ i \partial_t u +\left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha}u=-\lvert u \rvert ^2 u, $$
where $\frac{1}{2}< \alpha < 1$ and the operator $(-\Delta)^\alpha$ is the
fractional Laplacian with symbol $\lvert k \rvert ^{2\alpha}$. We establish
global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s\geq \frac{1-\alpha}{2}$ and
we conjecture this threshold to be sharp as it corresponds to the
pseudo-Galilean symmetry exponent. Our proof uses the $I$-method to control the
$H^s(\mathbb{T})$-norm of solutions with infinite energy initial data. A key
component of our approach is a set of improved long-time linear and bilinear
Strichartz estimates on the rescaled torus, which allow us to exploit the
subcritical nature of the equation.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problems for the time-space fractional

Based on the theory of harmonic analysis, using techniques such as real

TL;DR: The paper derives bounds for weights in discrete Ricci curvature flows and applies them to detect core subgraphs, outperforming traditional methods like PageRank and centrality measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Ricci curvature is key for analyzing network structure, resilience, and flow optimization. The study aims to improve core subgraph detection using Ricci curvature flows.

Method: The authors derived upper and lower bounds for weights in discrete Ricci curvature flows and used these flows to detect core subgraphs in undirected graphs.

Result: The method ensures weights remain bounded within iterations and outperforms traditional centrality measures in core subgraph detection.

Conclusion: The Ricci curvature flow method is effective for core subgraph detection, with bounded weights and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph Ricci curvature is crucial as it geometrically quantifies network
structure. It pinpoints bottlenecks via negative curvature, identifies cohesive
communities with positive curvature, and highlights robust hubs. This guides
network analysis, resilience assessment, flow optimization, and effective
algorithm design.
  In this paper, we derived upper and lower bounds for the weights along
several kinds of discrete Ricci curvature flows. As an application, we utilized
discrete Ricci curvature flows to detect the core subgraph of a finite
undirected graph. The novelty of this work has two aspects. Firstly, along the
Ricci curvature flow, the bounds for weights determine the minimum number of
iterations required to ensure weights remain between two prescribed positive
constants. In particular, for any fixed graph, we conclude weights can not
overflow and can not be treated as zero, as long as the iteration does not
exceed a certain number of times; Secondly, it demonstrates that our Ricci
curvature flow method for identifying core subgraphs outperforms prior
approaches, such as page rank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality and
closeness centrality. The codes for our algorithms are available at

Motivation: To understand the behavior of chemotaxis systems under fast signaling dynamics compared to species diffusion, addressing singular limits and convergence properties.

Method: Study two singular limits (ε→0+ with fixed τ>0, and (ε,τ)→(0+,0+)) in a chemotaxis system with no-flux boundary conditions, analyzing convergence and critical manifolds.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed analysis of singular limits in chemotaxis systems, offering insights into their behavior under fast signaling dynamics.

Abstract: Under relevant biological situations of the signalling process on a much

study two singular limits corresponding to $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ with a fixed

Motivation: To understand the dissipation measure in inviscid limits of 2D fluids and its relationship with vorticity and compactness.

Method: Study Leray-Hopf solutions, prove dissipation properties, and analyze initial vorticity as a measure. Provide kinematic examples and quantitative rates.

Result: Dissipation is Lebesgue in time and absolutely continuous under certain conditions. Dynamics at Kolmogorov scale is key for anomalous dissipation.

Conclusion: The study offers new criteria for anomalous dissipation and insights into dissipation measures, supported by kinematic examples and quantitative analysis.

Abstract: We study the dissipation measure arising in the inviscid limit of
two-dimensional incompressible fluids. For Leray-Hopf solutions it is proved
that the dissipation is Lebesgue in time and, for almost every time, it is
absolutely continuous with respect to the defect measure of strong compactness
of the solutions. When the initial vorticity is a measure, the dissipation is
proved to be absolutely continuous with respect to a suitable "quadratic"
space-time vorticity measure. This results into the trivial measure if the
initial vorticity has singular part of distinguished sign, or a spatially
purely atomic measure if wild oscillations in time are ruled out. In fact, the
dynamics at the Kolmogorov scale is the only relevant one, in turn offering new
criteria for anomalous dissipation. We provide kinematic examples highlighting
the strengths and the limitations of our approach. Quantitative rates,
dissipation life-span and steady fluids are also investigated.

Motivation: To understand and quantify the convergence behavior of solutions under vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with constraints.

Method: Investigates the problem for $p>2$, deriving convergence rates for nonnegative Lipschitz data and semiconcave data.

Result: For Lipschitz data, the rate is $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1/2})$; for semiconcave data, an improved rate of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$ is achieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We prove that for two-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost, the
optimal map is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ diffeomorphism outside a closed set of Lebesgue
measure zero provided the marginals are $\alpha$-H\"older continuous and
bounded away from zero and infinity. Excluding a set of measure zero is
necessary as optimal maps for the Coulomb cost have long been known to exhibit
jump singularities across codimension $1$ surfaces (even for smooth marginals
on convex domains).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the evolution problem for the 1-Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions, ensuring strong solutions for given data.

Result: Strong solutions exist and are unique for data in L²(Ω). Solutions match large solutions for maximum boundary flux.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and explicit solutions, confirming the applicability of maximal monotone operator theory in this context.

Abstract: This paper deals with evolution problem for the $1$-Laplacian with mixed

existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for data in $L^2(\Omega)$ by mean
of the theory of maximal monotone operator. We also see that if the flux on the
boundary is~$1$ (that is, the maximum possible) then these strong solutions can
be seen as the large solutions introduced in \cite{MP}. We give explicit
examples of solutions.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper extends the compactness theorem for Ginzburg-Landau minimizers to the Landau-de Gennes setting, proving relative compactness in $W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$ for $1<p<2$ under a logarithmic energy bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the compactness results from complex Ginzburg-Landau minimizers to the $\mathbb R\mathbf{P}^2$-valued Landau-de Gennes functional for nematic liquid crystals.

Method: Analyzing the sequence of minimizers $\{\mathbf{Q}_{\varepsilon}\}$ under the energy bound $C(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+1)$ and proving compactness in $W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$.

Result: The sequence of minimizers is relatively compact in $W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$ for $1<p<2$, with uniform local bounds on the bulk energy potential.

Conclusion: The results extend classical compactness theorems to the Landau-de Gennes setting, providing improved estimates for the bulk energy potential.

Abstract: For the Landau-de Gennes functional modeling nematic liquid crystals in
dimension three, we prove that, if the energy is bounded by
$C(\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+1)$, then the sequence of minimizers
$\{\mathbf{Q}_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon\in (0,1)}$ is relatively compact in
$W_{\operatorname{loc}}^{1,p}$ for every $1<p<2$. This extends the classical
compactness theorem of Bourgain-Br\'{e}zis-Mironescu [Publ. Math., IH\'{E}S,
99:1-115, 2004] for complex Ginzburg-Landau minimizers to the $\mathbb R\mathbf
P^2$-valued Landau-de Gennes setting. Moreover, We obtain local bounds on the
integral of the bulk energy potential that are uniform in $ \varepsilon $,
improving the estimate that follows directly from the assumption.

### [44] [Regularity of the global attractor for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on channel-like domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01868)
*Ricardo M. S. Rosa*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the regularity of the global attractor for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on 2D channel-like domains, showing compactness in stronger norms under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the regularity and convergence properties of the global attractor for Navier-Stokes flows in non-smooth domains.

Method: Uses functional analysis and the Poincaré inequality to study the attractor's compactness in spaces like V and D(A^{-s+1}).

Result: The global attractor is compact in V and D(A^{-s+1}) under certain conditions on the forcing term and domain smoothness.

Conclusion: The work extends regularity results for global attractors in non-smooth domains, highlighting the role of forcing terms and domain properties.

Abstract: The regularity of the global attractor of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations for flows on two-dimensional domains is considered. It is assumed
that domain $\Omega$ is a channel-like domain, i.e an arbitrary bounded or
unbounded domain, at first without any regularity assumption on its boundary,
with the only assumption that the Poincar\'e inequality holds on it. The phase
space $H$ for the system is the usual closure in the $L^2(\Omega)^2$ norm of
the space of smooth divergent-free vector-fields with compact support in
$\Omega.$ The corresponding space obtained as the closure with respect to the
$H^1(\Omega)^2$ norm is denoted by $V.$ The forcing term is assumed to belong
to dual space $V'.$ It is known in this case that the global attractor exists
in the phase space $H.$ It is shown in this work that the global attractor is
also a compact set in $V$, and that due to the regularization effect of the
equations, the solutions converge to the attractor in the norm of $V$,
uniformly for initial conditions bounded in $H$. Moreover, it is shown that if
the forcing term belongs to $D(A^{-s})$, for some $0<s\leq 1/2$, where $A$ is
the Stokes operator, then the global attractor is compact in $D(A^{-s+1})$. If
the forcing term is in $H,$ corresponding to the limit case $s=0,$ then it is
further assumed that the domain is either a uniformly $\Ccal^{1,1}$ smooth
domain or a bounded Lipschitz domain in order to obtain that the global
attractor is compact in $D(A).$

Conclusion: The results provide insights into the spectral properties of quasilinear operators under weak perturbations, highlighting the role of dimensionality and nonlinearity.

Abstract: We consider a critical quasilinear operator $-\Delta_p u +V|u|^{p-2}u$ in
$\mathbb{R}^N$ perturbed by a weakly coupled potential. For $N>p$, we find the
leading asymptotic of the lowest eigenvalue of such an operator in the weak
coupling limit separately for $N>p^2$ and $N\leq p^2$.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies dynamic boundary conditions for PDEs like the heat and Allen-Cahn equations, focusing on a model where the bulk follows the Allen-Cahn equation and the boundary follows the Cahn-Hilliard type. It analyzes asymptotic behavior, well-posedness, and error estimates for three limiting systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of PDEs with dynamic boundary conditions, particularly focusing on the interplay between bulk (Allen-Cahn) and boundary (Cahn-Hilliard) dynamics.

Method: Analyzes the asymptotic behavior of the system, including well-posedness of limiting problems and error estimates for solutions.

Result: Discusses the properties of three types of limiting systems, providing insights into their behavior and solutions.

Conclusion: The study offers a detailed analysis of the model, contributing to the understanding of dynamic boundary conditions in PDEs.

Abstract: Problems for partial differential equations coupled with dynamic boundary
conditions can be viewed as a type of transmission problem between the bulk and
its boundary. For the heat equation and the Allen-Cahn equation, various forms
of such problems with dynamic boundary conditions are studied in this paper. In
the case of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in the bulk, several models have been
proposed in which the boundary equations and conditions differ. Recently, the
vanishing surface diffusion limit has been investigated in more than one of
these models. In such settings, the resulting dynamic boundary equation
typically takes the form of a forward-backward parabolic equation. In this
paper, we focus on a different model, in which the Allen-Cahn equation governs
the bulk dynamics, while the boundary condition is of Cahn-Hilliard type. We
analyze the asymptotic behavior of the system, including the well-posedness of
the limiting problems and corresponding error estimates for the differences
between solutions. These aspects are discussed for three types of limiting
systems.

*Jinkai Gao,Xinfu Li,Shiwang Ma*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies a planar Choquard equation, proving that least energy solutions neither blow up nor vanish as $p\to+\infty$, while modified solutions exhibit blow-up behavior. Results align with the Lane-Emden equation as $\alpha\to 0$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the behavior of solutions to the planar Choquard equation, particularly focusing on their blow-up or vanishing properties, and compare them with higher-dimensional cases and the Lane-Emden equation.

Method: The authors study the planar Choquard equation in a smooth bounded domain, analyzing least energy solutions and modified solutions under varying parameters $p$ and $\alpha$.

Result: Least energy solutions $u_p$ do not blow up or vanish but develop one peak as $p\to+\infty$. Modified solutions $pu_p$ exhibit blow-up behavior. Results align with the Lane-Emden equation when $\alpha\to 0$.

Conclusion: The planar Choquard equation exhibits unique solution behaviors distinct from higher dimensions, with least energy solutions remaining bounded and modified solutions blowing up. The findings bridge the gap to the Lane-Emden equation.

Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the following planar Choquard equation
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta
u=\displaystyle\left(\int\limits_{\Omega}\frac{u^{p+1}(y)}{|x-y|^\alpha}dy\right)u^{p},\quad
u>0,\ \ &\mbox{in}\ \Omega,
  \quad \ \ u=0, \ \ &\mbox{on}\ \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$ and $p>1$ is a positive parameter. Unlike the
higher-dimensional case, we prove that the least energy solutions $u_{p}$
neither blow up nor vanish, and develop only one peak as $p\to+\infty$ under
suitable assumptions on $\Omega$. In contrast, the modified solutions $pu_p$
exhibit blow-up behavior analogous to that observed in higher dimensions.
Furthermore, as $\alpha \to 0$, the main results of this paper become
consistent with the known conclusions for the corresponding Lane-Emden
equation.

Method: 1. Constructs an abstract framework with semigroups and generators. 2. Formulates and proves well-posedness of a mean-field evolution problem. 3. Shows propagation of chaos for N-particle systems.

Result: The framework is applicable to various mean-field models, demonstrated by a new result for Levy-type systems, including McKean-Vlasov diffusion.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a versatile and unified approach to mean-field systems, extending beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: In this work, we formulate an abstract framework to study mean-field systems.
In contrast to most approaches in the available literature which primarily rely
on the analysis of SDEs, ours is based on optimal transport and semigroup
theory. This allows for the inclusion of a wider range of mean-field particle
systems within a unified structure. This new approach involves: (1)
constructing an abstract framework using semigroups and generators; (2)
formulating a corresponding mean-field evolution problem, and proving its
well-posedness; (3) demonstrating the propagation of chaos for a class of
N-particle systems associated with the mean-field model. Our results are
readily applicable to various mean-field models. To demonstrate this, we apply
our findings to obtain a new result for Levy-type mean-field systems, which
encompass the McKean-Vlasov diffusion.

Motivation: The study is motivated by phase space analysis of Schrödinger evolution operators, aiming to understand the diagonalization of metaplectic operators along symplectic flows.

Method: The method involves time-frequency analysis of functions with Gelfand-Shilov regularity and Gabor wave packet decomposition to analyze metaplectic operators.

Result: Quantitative bounds for matrix coefficients are established, showing exponential decay rates and dispersive effects. Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results are generalized for broader applications.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of metaplectic operators and their diagonalization, with implications for quantum harmonic oscillators and other models like the free particle in a magnetic field.

Abstract: Motivated by the phase space analysis of Schr\"odinger evolution operators,
in this paper we investigate how metaplectic operators are approximately
diagonalized along the corresponding symplectic flows by exponentially
localized Gabor wave packets. Quantitative bounds for the matrix coefficients
arising in the Gabor wave packet decomposition of such operators are
established, revealing precise exponential decay rates together with subtler
dispersive and spreading phenomena. To this aim, we present several novel
results concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled
Gelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct,
we generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the
quantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general
exponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\"odinger
propagators. In particular, we extensively discuss some prominent models such
as the harmonic oscillator, the free particle in a constant magnetic field and
fractional Fourier transforms.

Method: Combines integral representation of solutions with spherical harmonic decomposition.

Result: Establishes nondegeneracy of solutions, extending known results from related equations.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in understanding the nondegeneracy of solutions, contributing to broader mathematical theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the following Choquard equation with exponential

Motivation: To investigate Liouville type theorems for 3D stationary magneto-micropolar fluid equations, focusing on relaxed growth conditions for angular velocity.

Result: Proves Liouville theorems under relaxed growth conditions, allowing polynomial growth for angular velocity in $L^q$-norms. Extends results to 3D stationary micropolar fluid equations.

Conclusion: The study successfully relaxes constraints on angular velocity growth and extends Liouville theorems to related fluid equations.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Liouville type theorems for the 3D stationary
magneto-micropolar fluid equations. Adopting an iterative procedure, taking
advantage of the special structure of the equations and using a novel
combination of two different interpolation inequalities, we establish Liouville
type theorems if the smooth solution satisfies certain growth conditions in
terms of $L^p$-norms on the annuli. Compared with the velocity field and the
magnetic field, we raise the most relaxed restriction for the angular velocity.
More specifically, we allow $L^q$-norm of the angular velocity on the annuli to
grow polynomially at any degree. Besides, we also obtain Liouville type
theorems for the 3D stationary micropolar fluid equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the findings of Duyckaerts and Merle (2009) beyond radial solutions, addressing dynamics at the ground state energy.

Method: Extends the analysis of the 4D energy-critical nonlinear Schrödinger equation to non-radial solutions, leveraging prior work on radial cases.

Result: Non-radial solutions either scatter in both time directions or align with a heteroclinic orbit, scattering in one direction and converging to the ground state in the other.

Conclusion: The study successfully generalizes the radial solution dynamics to non-radial cases, confirming similar behavior.

Abstract: We study dynamics of the 4$d$ energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger

Funct. Anal. (2009)] proved that any radial solution with kinetic energy less

coincides (modulo symmetries) with a heteroclinic orbit, which scatters in one
time direction and converges to the ground state in the other. We extend this
result to the non-radial setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict the number of TIMs in hermitian systems accurately and robustly, addressing challenges in topological wave analysis.

Method: Uses the SFM correspondence to compute Chern numbers of a complex line bundle over a phase space sphere, employing a simplicial mesh for gauge-invariant, derivative-free calculations.

Result: Successfully reproduces TIM counts for equatorial fluid waves and topological Langmuir cyclotron waves, with potential for experimental application.

Conclusion: The method is effective for predicting TIMs and holds promise for analyzing experimental bulk wave polarizations.

Abstract: A computational approach for predicting the number of topological interface
modes (TIMs) in hermitian systems using the spectral flow - monopole (SFM)
correspondence is presented. The number of TIMs is determined by calculating
the Chern number of a complex line bundle of local polarisation vectors over a
phase space sphere surrounding a Weyl point. The Chern number is computed by
constructing the simplicial first Chern class of a discrete vector bundle on a
simplicial mesh. This approach is gauge invariant, derivative free, structure
preserving, and robust to noise. The algorithm is shown to reproduce the
expected number of TIMs for the case of equatorial fluid waves and the
topological Langmuir cyclotron wave. The possibility of using this algorithm to
analyse experimental measurements of bulk wave polarisations and predict the
associated number of TIMs is explored in a synthetic example.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FETs rely on electrons for signal processing, but PFETs for thermal management are underdeveloped, especially in achieving reversible thermal conductivity modulation.

Method: The proposed PFET integrates a substrate with a 2D material to form an engineered junction, leveraging differences in out-of-plane acoustic phonon properties. Molecular dynamics simulations of a graphene/hexagonal boron nitride junction validate the design.

Result: Simulations show a 44-fold thermal conductivity reduction at 100 K, with the effect persisting at room temperature and across various substrates, demonstrating robustness.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new approach for dynamic thermal management in electronics, overcoming limitations of current PFETs.

Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) predominantly utilize electrons for signal
processing in modern electronics. In contrast, phonon-based field-effect
transistors (PFETs)-which employ phonons for active thermal management-remain
markedly underdeveloped, with effectively reversible thermal conductivity
modulation posing a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel PFET
architecture enabling reversible thermal conductivity modulation. This design
integrates a substrate in the central region with a two-dimensional (2D)
material to form an engineered junction, exploiting differences in out-of-plane
acoustic phonon properties to regulate heat flow. Molecular dynamics
simulations of a graphene (Gr)/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) junction
demonstrate a substantial thermal conductivity reduction up to 44-fold at 100
K. The effect is maintained at room temperature and across diverse substrates,
confirming robustness. This work establishes a new strategy for dynamic thermal
management in electronics.

*Jiyong Kim,Sunwoong Yang,Namwoo Kang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A novel point-wise diffusion model processes spatio-temporal points independently for efficient prediction of complex physical systems, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in conventional image-based diffusion models for complex physical systems with shape variations, enabling real-time prediction.

Method: Uses forward and backward diffusion processes at individual points with a point-wise diffusion transformer for denoising, validated on 2D and 3D systems.

Result: Achieves 100-200x computational speedup, 94.4% faster training, 89.0% fewer parameters, and 28% better accuracy than image-based models.

Conclusion: The point-wise approach is superior for real-time prediction, offering efficiency and accuracy across diverse physical systems.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

Motivation: To advance simulation of optical response properties in solid-state materials using accurate quantum mechanical methods.

Method: Coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs), implemented in CCResPy.

Result: Test calculations show inversion of polarizability tensor elements in periodic chains and explore convergence in PBC thermodynamic limit.

Conclusion: Significant progress in simulating optical response properties for solids with systematically improvable quantum methods.

Abstract: We report the first implementation of the frequency-dependent electric
dipole-electric dipole polarizability for 1D periodic systems computed with the
coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) method with periodic
boundary conditions (PBCs). The implementation is performed in the CCResPy
open-source software, based on Python and the NumPy library. The complete
equations and many details of the implementation are discussed. The test
calculations show the impact on this linear response property of passing from a
single molecule to a periodic chain, where the relative magnitude of the
polarizability tensor elements is inverted. This work also explores the
convergence towards the PBC thermodynamic limit with k-space sampling, and some
remaining issues in the definition of the electric dipole operator for periodic
systems. This work represents a significant step forward for the simulation of
optical response properties for solid-state materials with accurate and
systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.

*Lei Wu*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: An efficient iterative method is proposed to solve the linear stability equation of the Boltzmann kinetic equation, addressing computational challenges in high-dimensional phase space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Boltzmann equation's linear stability analysis is crucial for space exploration, where rarefaction effects invalidate Navier-Stokes equations. Direct eigenvalue solutions are computationally impractical.

Method: The method combines outer iterations (shifted inverse power method for eigenvalues/eigenfunctions) and inner iterations (general synthetic iterative scheme for high-dimensional inversion).

Result: The method is efficient and accurate, demonstrated in planar sound wave and Couette flow, requiring few hundred iterations and allowing large spatial cell sizes in near-continuum regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative approach effectively solves the Boltzmann equation's linear stability problem, offering computational feasibility for practical applications.

Abstract: The linear stability analysis of the Boltzmann kinetic equation has recently
garnered research interest due to its potential applications in space
exploration, where rarefaction effects can render the Navier Stokes equations
invalid. Since the Boltzmann equation is defined in a seven-dimensional phase
space, directly solving the associated eigenvalue problems is computationally
intractable. In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative method to solve
the linear stability equation of the kinetic equation. The solution process
involves both outer and inner iterations. In the outer iteration, the shifted
inverse power method is employed to compute selected eigenvalues and their
corresponding eigenfunctions of interest. For the inner iteration, which
involves inverting the high-dimensional system for the velocity distribution
function, we adopt our recently developed general synthetic iterative scheme to
ensure fast converging and asymptotic preserving properties. As a proof of
concept, our method demonstrates both high efficiency and accuracy in planar
sound wave and Couette flow. Each eigenpair can be computed with only a few
hundred iterations of the kinetic equation, and the spatial cell size can be
significantly larger than the molecular mean free path in near-continuum flow
regimes.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through numerical experiments on complex generalized diffusion processes, including noisy data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully learns physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions, even with complex dynamics and noisy data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying

combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The study uses automated chemical kinetic modeling to analyze Pt-catalyzed dry reforming of methane (DRM), identifying key reaction pathways and kinetic bottlenecks. Model predictions align with experimental data, revealing OCX as a critical intermediate and CO desorption as a limiting step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize Pt-catalyzed DRM for CO2 utilization and syngas production, addressing kinetic limitations and reaction pathways.

Method: Automated chemical kinetic model generation, sensitivity analysis, and flux analysis to study DRM between 700-1100 K.

Result: Model predictions match experimental data, identifying OCX as a bottleneck and CO desorption as a limiting step. Three temperature-dependent operational regimes were discovered.

Conclusion: The study provides design principles for Pt-based DRM catalysts, emphasizing temperature-specific optimization. It pioneers automated microkinetic modeling for Pt-DRM.

Abstract: Dry reforming of methane (DRM) over platinum catalysts offers a promising
route for CO2 utilization and syngas (H2/CO) production, a versatile feedstock
for synthetic fuels. This study employs automated chemical kinetic model
generation to present a detailed microkinetic mechanism for Pt-catalyzed DRM
between 700-1100 K, identifying key reaction pathways and kinetic limitations
through sensitivity analysis.
  Model predictions of CH4 and CO2 conversion and syngas production closely
match fixed-bed experimental data across the entire temperature range and
varied feed ratios. Our predictive reaction network reveals that OCX serves as
a critical bottleneck intermediate for cooperative CH4 and CO2 activation.
While CO desorption (OCX <=> CO + X) was identified as the most influential
step with strong negative sensitivity toward methane concentration, OCX
regeneration (CO2X + CX <=> 2OCX) inhibits methane conversion by maintaining
surface saturation.
  Methane activation follows sequential C-H scissions (CH4X -> CH3X -> CH2X ->
CHX -> CX), while CO2 activation proceeds predominantly via a hydrogen-mediated
carboxyl route (CO2X + HX -> COOHX -> COX + OHX). Three operational regimes
were identified: low-temperature desorption-limited kinetics (700-850 K),
transitional pathway activation (850-950 K), and high-temperature distributed
control with carbon management challenges (950-1300 K).
  These insights provide design principles for platinum-based DRM catalysts,
emphasizing temperature-specific optimization strategies. This is the first
study to apply fully automated microkinetic model generation to Pt-catalyzed
DRM, integrating sensitivity analysis, flux analysis, and surface speciation
for catalyst design.

### [63] [Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02626)
*He Zhang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a C++ library for symbolic Differential Algebra (DA) computation to optimize DA-based Fast Multipole Method (FMM) operators, achieving 20-50x speedups and outperforming state-of-the-art FMM implementations for certain error thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DA-based FMM operators are less efficient than other frameworks. The goal is to improve their performance by deriving explicit symbolic expressions and generating optimized code.

Method: Developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation to derive explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators, enabling highly optimized code generation.

Result: Achieved 20-50x speedups for individual FMM operators. Enhanced DA-FMM outperformed pyfmmlib and traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM for relative errors ≥10^-7.

Conclusion: Symbolic DA computation significantly improves the efficiency of DA-based FMM, making it competitive with other frameworks for certain applications.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between
particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles.
The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and
approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions.
Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA),
computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users
to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation.
This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in
FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency
compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as
Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++
library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit
expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then
used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant
computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators,
this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the
numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two
state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian
tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order
of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both
alternatives.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enforce quasineutrality and charge density conservation in Vlasov-Poisson and Vlasov-Ampère systems using Dirac's constraint theory, validated through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically enforce quasineutrality and charge density conservation in electrostatic plasma dynamics models, addressing the limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Applies Dirac's constraint theory to Hamiltonian field formulations of VP and VA systems, constructing generalized Dirac brackets to enforce constraints via modified Vlasov equations.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm charge density conservation, showing significant dynamic modifications under quasineutrality constraints.

Conclusion: The method provides a systematic way to enforce quasineutrality and assess its validity across kinetic scales, with implications for plasma dynamics modeling.

Abstract: We present a method for imposing quasineutrality and, more generally, charge
density conservation in the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) and Vlasov-Amp\`ere (VA)
systems, which describe electrostatic plasma dynamics, by applying the Dirac
theory of constraints. Leveraging the Hamiltonian field formulations of the VP
and VA models, we construct generalized Dirac brackets using the Dirac
algorithm. The resulting constrained systems enforce charge density
conservation, and consequently quasineutrality, through new advection terms in
the Vlasov equations involving generalized-force terms, while the electric
field is eliminated from the constrained Vlasov dynamics. To verify charge
density conservation we conduct one-dimensional numerical experiments using a
semi-Lagrangian method, demonstrating that the enforcement of the
quasineutrality constraint significantly modifies the dynamics. This approach
enables us to identify the forces required to enforce quasineutrality, offering
a systematic way to assess the validity of the quasineutral approximation
across different kinetic scales.

*W. Tierens,A. Kumar,J. Lore,G. Urbanczyk,R. Diab,The WEST Team*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses asymmetric hot spots in ICRH systems, showing they stem from wave physics, not misalignment. Solutions like poloidal phasing or limiter shaping reduce sputtering and erosion, enhancing reliability for fusion devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICRH is critical for next-gen fusion devices, but asymmetric hot spots risk antenna reliability and plasma performance. Understanding and mitigating these asymmetries is vital.

Method: The study identifies intrinsic wave physics as the cause of asymmetries and proposes poloidal phasing control or modified limiter shapes as solutions.

Result: Poloidal phasing and limiter shaping reduce peak sputtering by ~3x and total erosion by ~2x compared to current designs.

Conclusion: Optimized limiter shaping ensures robust ICRH performance, essential for high-power, long-duration operation in fusion reactors.

Abstract: Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies heating (ICRH) and current drive will be
essential for sustaining high-performance plasmas in next-generation fusion
devices (e.g. ITER, SPARC). ICRH actuators routinely produce localized hot
spots on limiters and nearby components, posing serious risks to antenna
reliability, material survivability, and overall plasma performance.
Remarkably, these hot spots are often strongly asymmetric, even with nominally
symmetric plasma conditions and antenna geometries. We show that such
asymmetries exist intrinsically in the wave physics rather than solely being
due to misalignment or edge plasma variation. Our results strongly suggest that
this asymmetry can be compensated for by using either poloidal phasing control
(which e.g. the under construction WEST traveling wave antenna can do) or
modified limiter shapes, suppressing peak sputtering by a factor $\sim$3 and
reducing total erosion by a factor of $\sim$2 compared to state-of-the-art
designs. This capability is essential for sustaining high-power, long-duration
ICRH operation in reactor-scale devices and other next-generation fusion
systems. By distributing heat and particle fluxes more evenly across antenna
surfaces, optimized limiter shaping provides a clear pathway to robust,
reliable ICRH performance in existing and planned fusion devices.

TL;DR: Finite ion Larmor radius enhances interaction dynamics in small-scale plasma flows, causing magnetic arch expansion and reconnection, while larger scales transition to ideal MHD with slower evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how finite ion Larmor radius affects plasma flow dynamics in a magnetic arch configuration, especially in weakly collisional systems.

Method: Hybrid numerical simulations of counterstreaming plasma flows in a magnetic arch, varying system scale relative to ion Larmor radius.

Result: Smaller scales (close to ion Larmor radius) show intense dynamics, magnetic arch expansion, reconnection, and ion-cyclotron wave generation. Larger scales transition to ideal MHD with slower evolution and no instabilities.

Conclusion: System scale relative to ion Larmor radius critically determines plasma dynamics, with smaller scales exhibiting richer phenomena like reconnection and wave generation.

Abstract: The effect of the finite ion Larmor radius on the dynamics of two
counterstreaming weakly collisional plasma flows in a magnetic field of an arch
configuration is considered. Hybrid numerical simulations show that in a system
whose dimensions are close to the ion Larmor radius, more intense interaction
dynamics are observed, the magnetic arch experiences a significant expansion
with the formation of a region with an irregular character of magnetic lines,
in which magnetic reconnection processes occur. In this case, the generation of
a surface wave of the ion-cyclotron range is observed at the boundaries of the
arch. An increase in the scale of the system compared to the ion Larmor radius
leads to a transition to the ideal MHD regime, in which the evolution of the
arch occurs much more slowly, and the development of instabilities is not
observed.

build a Collisional-Radiative model for Na-like Krypton and Xenon. For Na-like
Krypton we compare our computed excitation energy, EIE cross-sections, rate
coefficients, emission line intensity with previous work. Additionally we
investigate variation of line ratios with temperature. For Na-like Xenon we
compared excitation energy for various fine-structure with NIST( [2]) database

TL;DR: The paper disproves the common belief in physics about twisted multilayer graphene, showing a trichotomy of band behaviors (higher-order crossings, flat bands, or Dirac cones) based on twisting angle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing assumption in physics that twisted multilayer graphene models only exhibit higher-order band crossings or flat bands.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the chiral limit of two sheets of n-layer Bernal-stacked graphene, focusing on twisting angle variations.

Result: A trichotomy of outcomes: (1) generic higher-order band crossings, (2) flat bands at magic angles, or (3) Dirac cones at specific twisting parameters.

Conclusion: The discovery introduces a new topological phase transition and expands understanding of twisted graphene systems.

Abstract: For the chiral limit of two sheets of $n$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene
established in the Physical Review Letters arXiv:2109.10325 and
arXiv:2109.11514, we prove a trichotomy: depending on the twisting angle, we
have either (1) generically, the band crossing of the first two bands is of
order $n$; or (2) at a discrete set of magic angles, the first two bands are
completely flat; or (3) for another discrete set of twisting parameters, the
bands exhibit Dirac cones. This new mathematical discovery disproves the common
belief in physics that such a twisted multilayer graphene model can only have
higher order band crossings or flat bands, and it leads to a new type of
topological phase transition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'partial order' in the Choose the Leader (CL) system, a new type of asymptotic correlation allowing deviations from total alignment, and analyzes its emergence and propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore more realistic models of biological and societal systems by defining and studying partial order in many-element systems.

Method: Defines partial order and examines its emergence in the CL model, including its critical scaling and propagation dynamics.

Result: Demonstrates the emergence of partial order in the CL model and provides a quantitative estimate for convergence to this state.

Conclusion: Partial order offers a new framework for analyzing probabilistic models in biology and society, enhancing realism.

Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in
many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic
correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly
to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the
elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence.
Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows
its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we
discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a
quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as
well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic)
models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry by leveraging neural networks for accurate solutions to complex molecular systems.

Method: Using the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA) to optimize neural network wavefunctions, scaling model size and computational resources for improved accuracy.

Result: Achieved subchemical accuracy (1 kJ/mol), better wavefunctions, and accurate properties like electron densities and dipole moments. Demonstrated success on systems like benzene, nitrogen dimer, and cyclic ozone.

Conclusion: The approach sets a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry, offering near-exact reference calculations with universal reliability and practical applicability.

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver
near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad
range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead
Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that
systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into
greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all
tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a
systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation
resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol
"chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy.
Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions
with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities,
dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising
way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry.
For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential
energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the
cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive
benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or
highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic
ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone
barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with
unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability,
establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of generative AI outputs unpredictably shifting from correct to misleading, which has caused significant financial losses and harm.

Method: The method involves mapping the AI's behavior to a multispin thermal system and deriving an exact formula for the tipping point, considering user prompts and training bias.

Result: The results reveal the tipping instability at the AI's basic Attention head level and show how multilayer architecture amplifies output tipping.

Conclusion: The findings improve AI transparency and explainability, offering a way to quantify user risk and legal liabilities.

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'

Motivation: To establish conditions under which measurable functions with $L^p$-integrable upper gradients are constant terms away from $L^p$-integrability, and explore properties of hyperbolic fillings.

Method: Constructs hyperbolic fillings $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ via a warped product of $Y$ with an exponentially weighted real line, and analyzes the identity $D^{1,p}(Z) = N^{1,p}(Z) + \mathbb{R}$ for specific $Y$ and $p$.

Result: For $Z=\mathbb{H}_{\alpha,\beta}(Y)$ and $1\le p\le \beta/\alpha$, the identity holds. Also, $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is Gromov hyperbolic with a quasisymmetric boundary to $Y$.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for analyzing metric measure spaces and their functional properties, linking hyperbolic geometry with Sobolev-type identities.

Abstract: We construct a large class of metric measure spaces $Z$ which satisfy the
identity $D^{1,p}(Z) = N^{1,p}(Z) + \mathbb{R}$, i.e.\ any measurable function
$u \colon Z \to \mathbb{R}$ with an $L^p$-integrable upper gradient is a
constant term away from being $L^p$-integrable. To do so, we construct a family
of hyperbolic fillings $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$, $\alpha, \beta \in (0,
\infty)$, of a metric measure space $Y$, via a warped product of $Y$ with an
exponentially weighted positive real line. We then show that for certain
classes of $Y$, the above identity is satisfied for
$Z=\mathbb{H}_{\alpha,\beta}(Y)$ when $1\le p\le \beta/\alpha$. We also show
that under mild assumptions on $Y$, the warped product $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha,
\beta}(Y)$ is Gromov hyperbolic as a metric space and the Gromov boundary of
$\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is quasisymmetric to $Y$.

*Shoya Sasaki,Katsuhiro Endo,Mayu Muramatsu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hamiltonian simulation method (CLS) for nonlinear PDEs by combining Carleman linearization and warped phase transformation, demonstrating its application to a reaction-diffusion equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited research on Hamiltonian simulation for nonlinear governing equations and explore exponential speedup potential beyond linear systems.

Method: Combines Carleman linearization (CL) to transform nonlinear PDEs into linear equations, then maps them to the Schrödinger equation via warped phase transformation (WPT).

Result: The CLS method successfully transforms and solves nonlinear PDEs, exemplified by the reaction-diffusion equation.

Conclusion: The method extends Hamiltonian simulation to nonlinear PDEs, showing promise for efficient quantum solutions to classical systems.

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing that
has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential to efficiently solve
the governing equations of large-scale classical systems. Exponential speedup
through Hamiltonian simulation has been rigorously demonstrated in the case of
coupled harmonic oscillators. The question arises as to whether Hamiltonian
simulations in other physical systems also accelerate exponentially.
Schr\"odingerization is a technique that transforms the governing equations of
classical systems into the Schr\"odinger equation. However, since the
Schr\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often
limited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for
nonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we
propose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization +
Schr\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and
warped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear
PDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then
mapped to the Schr\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be
solved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\"odinger
equation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation
into the Schr\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\"odinger equation
then enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific
application, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation
to demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.

TL;DR: The paper studies Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics at finite temperature, analyzing electron-proton plasmas with dimensional regularization and hard-thermal-loop resummation. It finds no new UV divergences, a double-Yukawa force profile, and no magnetic screening mass. Thermodynamic shifts and conductivity changes are minimal, with potential implications for future experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the implications of Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics in finite-temperature plasmas, particularly focusing on UV completion of electrostatics and gauge symmetry effects.

Method: Uses dimensional regularization and hard-thermal-loop resummation to analyze one- and two-loop orders in electron-proton plasmas.

Result: No new UV divergences; double-Yukawa force profile; no magnetic screening mass; minimal thermodynamic and conductivity changes.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics, with potential experimental benchmarks for future research in strong-field, collider, and lattice studies.

Abstract: We present a finite-temperature study of Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics,
following electron-proton plasmas through one- and two-loop order with
dimensional regularisation and hard-thermal-loop resummation. The
higher-derivative operator is found to generate no new ultraviolet divergences;
all counter-terms reduce to the single photon wave-function factor of ordinary
QED. The static inter-particle force acquires a double-Yukawa profile, the
familiar Debye term plus an opposite-signed contribution from the heavy
Podolsky pole that removes the Coulomb singularity at sub-femtometre distances,
providing an intrinsic ultraviolet completion of electrostatics. Gauge symmetry
drives the transverse photon self-energy to zero at vanishing momentum, so no
magnetic screening mass appears at any perturbative order. In a covariantly
constant background the full two-loop sunset diagram yields a single,
dimension-eight operator suppressed by T^2/M^2, implying permille-level shifts
in thermodynamic quantities for realistic plasmas. The exact Debye mass and a
leading-log calculation show the dc electrical conductivity exceeds its QED
value by less than 10^-4. Conditions for observable Podolsky plasmons and
cosmological constraints are identified, supplying precise benchmarks for
future strong-field, collider and lattice investigations.

TL;DR: The paper discusses multiscale modeling of energetic molecular crystals, integrating atomistic simulations with continuum models for mechanical and chemical behavior, and highlights applications in shock-to-detonation studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop comprehensive multiscale constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals, bridging atomistic simulations with continuum models for better predictive capabilities in explosive behavior.

Method: Incorporates tools in molecular dynamics for continuum transfer, uses unsupervised learning for chemical kinetics, and implements models in finite-element codes for mesoscale simulations.

Result: Constructed a non-linear hyperelastic continuum model for TATB, calibrated chemical decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB, and extended to β-HMX with multi-components equation of state.

Conclusion: The work advances multiscale modeling of explosives, enabling shock-to-detonation studies and identifying the need for new experiments.

Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and
chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and
discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in
molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to
the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations
have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as
well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of
materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the
construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model
including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in
analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning
algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical
decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work,
the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a
multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a
finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the
mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots.
Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of
explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments,
discussed throughout the paper.

*Vrushaly Shinglot,John Zweck*

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of averaged models in modern short pulse fiber lasers due to significant pulse breathing, advocating for lumped models and analyzing their stability using the monodromy operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Averaged models fail to capture pulse breathing effects in fiber lasers, necessitating lumped models for accurate quantitative modeling and design.

Method: Uses lumped models and evaluates stability via the monodromy operator, derived by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic pulse. Conditions for operator existence and a formula for essential spectrum are provided.

Result: A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator is derived, enabling quantification of continuous wave perturbation growth rates. The results are adaptable to various lumped laser models.

Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates the applicability of the monodromy operator approach to a broad range of lumped laser models, despite being tested on a specific stretched pulse laser.

Abstract: In modern short pulse fiber lasers there is significant pulse breathing over
each round trip of the laser loop. Consequently, averaged models cannot be used
for quantitative modeling and design. Instead, lumped models, which are
obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser, are
required. Since the pulses in lumped models are periodic rather than
stationary, their linear stability is evaluated with the aid of the monodromy
operator obtained by linearizing the round trip operator about the periodic
pulse. Conditions are given on the smoothness and decay of the periodic pulse
which ensure that the monodromy operator exists on an appropriate Lebesgue
function space. A formula for the essential spectrum of the monodromy operator
is given which can be used to quantify the growth rate of continuous wave
perturbations. This formula is established by showing that the essential
spectrum of the monodromy operator equals that of an associated asymptotic
operator. Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication
operator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its
spectrum. Although the main results are stated for a particular experimental
stretched pulse laser, the analysis shows that they can be readily adapted to a
wide range of lumped laser models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of Hund's J terms in DFT+U+J corrections for accurately modeling energetics in strongly covalent Fe(II) spin-crossover systems.

Method: Minimum-tracking linear response was used to determine Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters, applied via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals.

Result: Canonical Hund's J terms failed to improve DFT+U's robust energetics, highlighting limitations for static correlation in covalent systems.

Conclusion: The study identifies limitations of Hund's J terms in DFT+U+J for covalent systems and suggests directions for improvement.

Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local
spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally
coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the
ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U
and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all
valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then
methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard
functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic
energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed
failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the
already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an
evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static
correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions
for their improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate TDDFT predictions of DSF in polycrystalline aluminium against high-resolution experimental data and understand the role of lattice effects.

Method: Compare TDDFT predictions of DSF with ultrahigh-resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements from the European XFEL, accounting for orientation averaging.

Result: TDDFT shows strong anisotropy in DSF, confirmed by experiments. Orientation averaging aligns theory with data, emphasizing lattice effects.

Conclusion: TDDFT accurately models DSF in polycrystalline aluminium when orientation averaging is considered, underscoring the importance of lattice effects.

Abstract: We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient
polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson
scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong
anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring
accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution
and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and
therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed
rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to
reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of
predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of
accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a phase-field model incorporating grain boundary (GB) anisotropy using a non-local functional of an orientation field, simplifying GB energy tuning and validation through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately modeling GB anisotropy in phase-field simulations without extensive fitting procedures.

Method: Extends standard phase-field equations with a non-local functional of an orientation field, sampling misorientation and inclination data near GBs.

Result: Validated by reproducing linear grain growth, Wulff shapes, and equilibrium dihedral angles; demonstrated grain growth and morphology effects in polycrystalline simulations.

Conclusion: The model effectively incorporates GB anisotropy, enabling precise control and validation of grain boundary properties in simulations.

Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field
modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation
to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the
number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field
and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from
sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the
grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy
anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional
includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a
function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by
reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying
misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium
dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate
grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of
anisotropy on grain morphology.

TL;DR: The paper studies outlier singular values in sparse random bipartite Erdős-Rényi graphs, identifying critical sparsity regimes and characterizing their emergence based on the graph's degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of singular values in sparse random bipartite graphs, especially outliers, under critical sparsity conditions.

Method: Analyzes the random bipartite Erdős-Rényi graph in the critical sparsity regime, using explicit functions of the aspect ratio to characterize outlier emergence.

Result: Outliers appear outside the MP law's bulk depending on sparsity: none for high sparsity, right-edge outliers for intermediate, and both edges for low sparsity.

Conclusion: The study provides precise conditions for outlier singular values in sparse random graphs, extending insights to rectangular matrices with bounded entries.

Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m,
p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in
$V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$
for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the
empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix
converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and
smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges,
respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu
and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the
compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we
consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some
constant $b>0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier
singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ functions of
$\gamma$, we prove that when $b > b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk;
when $b^{*}< b < b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of
the MP law; and when $b < b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with
high probability. Moreover, locations of those outliers are precisely
characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree
vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our
results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be
extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing fully nonlinear stochastic systems without simplifying assumptions like linearization or quadratic lifting, preserving essential dynamics and stochastic properties.

Method: Leverages structural properties of nonlinearities (e.g., Lipschitz continuity) to define generalized reachability and observability Gramians via Lyapunov-type operators, enabling projection-based reduction. Includes balancing and truncation for reduced systems.

Result: Provides sufficient conditions for Gramian existence, derives output error bounds, and demonstrates subspace identification from Gramian spectra. Extends balanced truncation to nonlinear stochastic systems.

Conclusion: The framework rigorously extends balanced truncation to nonlinear stochastic dynamics, offering a practical reduction method with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel model order reduction framework tailored for
fully nonlinear stochastic dynamics without lifting them to quadratic systems
and without using linearization techniques. By directly leveraging structural
properties of the nonlinearities -- such as local and one-sided Lipschitz
continuity or one-sided linear growth conditions -- the approach defines
generalized reachability and observability Gramians through Lyapunov-type
differential operators. These Gramians enable projection-based reduction while
preserving essential dynamics and stochastic characteristics. The paper
provides sufficient conditions for the existence of these Gramians, including a
Lyapunov-based mean square stability criterion, and derives explicit output
error bounds for the reduced order models. Furthermore, the work introduces a
balancing and truncation procedure for obtaining reduced systems and
demonstrates how dominant subspaces can be identified from the spectrum of the
Gramians. The theoretical findings are grounded in rigorous stochastic
analysis, extending balanced truncation techniques to a broad class of
nonlinear systems under stochastic excitation.

Result: The stochastic dynamics yields a measure-valued Markov process on regular measures, exhibiting strong Feller properties.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate a qualitative regularization by noise phenomenon in the studied systems.

Abstract: We consider equations of nonlinear transport on the circle with regular self

this process is strong Feller in the corresponding topology. This is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance understanding of ergodicity in KSE by studying convergence rates to equilibrium under stochastic forcing.

Method: Uses a coupling argument and Lyapunov functions inspired by deterministic equations.

Result: Demonstrates exponential attractiveness of the invariant measure, removing the need for small anti-diffusion coefficients.

Conclusion: The study provides stronger ergodicity results for KSE under random perturbations, enhancing previous findings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the large-time behaviors of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation (KSE) on the 1D torus while being subjected to random perturbation via
additive Gaussian noise. It is well-known that under suitable assumptions on
the stochastic forcing, the KSE admits a unique invariant probability measure.
In this work, we make further progress on the topic of ergodicity by addressing
the issue of convergence rate toward equilibrium. In comparison with the
previous results, we can prove that the unique invariant probability measure is
exponentially attractive and smallness condition of anti-diffusion coefficient
is not necessary here. The proof relies on a coupling argument while making use
of Lyapunov functions motivated by those of deterministic equations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design structures for additive manufacturing that resist deformations due to gravity during construction, ensuring constructability and resilience.

Method: Uses linear elasticity equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces. Employs a projected gradient method in function space, incorporating second-order information and nested procedures for efficiency.

Result: Proves existence of minimizers and differentiability of the cost functional. Numerically shows constant iteration numbers across discretization levels and construction layers, with enhanced performance from nested procedures and second-order information.

Conclusion: The method effectively optimizes structures for additive manufacturing, balancing constructability and resilience, with numerical results validating its robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: A topology optimization problem in a phase field setting is considered to
obtain rigid structures, which are resilient to external forces and
constructable with additive manufacturing. Hence, large deformations of
overhangs due to gravity shall be avoided during construction. The deformations
depend on the stage of the construction and are modelled by linear elasticity
equations on growing domains with height-dependent stress tensors and forces.
Herewith, possible hardening effects can be included. Analytical results
concerning the existence of minimizers and the differentiability of the reduced
cost functional are presented in case of a finite number of construction
layers. By proving Korn's inequality with a constant independent of the height,
it is shown that the cost functional, formulated continuously in height, is
well-defined. The problem is numerically solved using a projected gradient type
method in function space, for which applicability is shown. Second-order
information can be included by adapting the underlying inner product in every
iteration. Additional adjustments enhancing the solver's performance, such as a
nested procedure and subsystem solver specifcations, are stated. Numerical
evidence is provided that for all discretization level and also for any number
of construction layers, the iteration numbers stay roughly constant. The
benefits of the nested procedure as well as of the inclusion of second order
information are illustrated. Furthermore, the choice of weights for the
penalization of overhangs is discussed. For various problem settings, results
are presented for one or two materials and void in two as well as in three
dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of non-convex, nonlinear equality-constrained optimization problems, particularly in finite-sum settings, by improving computational efficiency and flexibility in sample size strategies.

Method: Incorporates adaptive sampling into quadratic penalty methods, uses non-monotone line search for step size, and avoids projections. Sample size can range from mini-batch to full sample.

Result: Proves almost sure convergence under standard assumptions and demonstrates effectiveness in numerical experiments on academic and real-world machine learning problems.

Conclusion: The algorithm offers a flexible, efficient solution for constrained optimization, bridging unconstrained and linearly constrained methods to nonlinear constraints.

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for solving non-convex, nonlinear
equality-constrained finite-sum optimization problems. The proposed algorithm
incorporates an additional sampling strategy for sample size update into the
well-known framework of quadratic penalty methods. Thus, depending on the
problem at hand, the resulting method may exhibit a sample size strategy
ranging from a mini-batch on one end, to increasing sample size that achieves
the full sample eventually, on the other end of the spectrum. A non-monotone
line search is used for the step size update, while the penalty parameter is
also adaptive. The proposed algorithm avoids costly projections, which,
together with the sample size update, may yield significant computational cost
savings. Also, the proposed method can be viewed as a transition of an
additional sampling approach for unconstrained and linear constrained problems,
to a more general class with non-linear constraints. The almost sure
convergence is proved under a standard set of assumptions for this framework,
while numerical experiments on both academic and real-data based machine
learning problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are versatile but costly to train. Pre-trained models may not perform well if the geometry or flow conditions differ from the target. This work aims to address this challenge.

Method: A fine-tuning approach with coordinate transformation is introduced. A pre-trained PINN model initializes the target DNN, and governing equations are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor.

Result: The proposed method improves training convergence for various cavity flows (square, rectangular, shear-deformed geometries). Pre-training with similar geometry further boosts efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach enhances PINN training efficiency, making it useful for real-world applications like modeling intra-aneurysmal blood flows.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an
alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep
neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve
inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it
remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with
an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential
solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow
condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes
a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling
lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem,
where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are
given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is
used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with
different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with
coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical
examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, and shear deformed
geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the
training convergence compared with an un-trained model. A pre-trained model
with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency.
These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling
intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.

TL;DR: A third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory compact least-squares scheme is developed for finite volume methods on structured curvilinear grids, ensuring high accuracy and robustness in smooth and discontinuous regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high accuracy and robustness in numerical simulations on structured non-uniform grids, especially for problems involving smooth and discontinuous regions.

Method: Uses compact least-squares reconstruction with optimal linear and non-linear weights, explicit second-order polynomials, and an improved shock detector for adaptive dissipation. Extended to Euler equations via characteristic decomposition.

Result: Demonstrates robustness and high-resolution in numerical examples, including linear convection and nonlinear Euler/Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively balances accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for complex simulations on structured grids.

Abstract: A third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory compact least-squares
scheme is developed for the finite volume method on structured curvilinear
non-uniform grids. The proposed scheme features compact least-squares
reconstruction with optimal linear weights for broad-spectrum accuracy and
non-linear weights for essentially non-oscillatory property. Through explicit
second-order polynomials given for each control volume, the scheme maintains
high accuracy on structured meshes with non-uniform grids. By integrating an
improved shock detector developed in this work, coefficients with adaptive
levels of dissipation are applied to achieve both the high resolution in smooth
regions and high robustness in discontinuous regions. Furthermore, the proposed
scheme is extended to the Euler equations through a characteristic
decomposition technique. Numerical examples including both linear convection
equation and nonlinear Euler/Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the robustness
and high-resolution of the proposed method.

### [89] [Hybrid Compact Least-Squares and Central Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Structured Curvilinear Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02042)
*Jianhua Pan,Luxin Li,Ji Yin,Wei-Gang Zeng*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Hybrid compact least-squares and central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are proposed for curvilinear grids, balancing high resolution in smooth regions and shock capture in discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately simulating compressible flows with both multiscale structures and discontinuities on curvilinear grids.

Method: Combines compact least-squares schemes for smooth regions and central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes for discontinuities, with optimized parameters and a robust shock detector.

Result: The hybrid schemes achieve high resolution in smooth regions and oscillation-free shock capture, validated through benchmarks on various grids and flow problems.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes are efficient and applicable for compressible flows with multiscale features and discontinuities.

Abstract: A series of third- and fifth-order hybrid compact least-squares central
weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are proposed and applied to
curvilinear structured grids for the finite volume method. In smooth regions,
compact least-squares schemes based on interfacial differences of derivatives
are utilized to keep the high resolution of multiscale structures, whereas in
discontinuous regions, central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are
included to enable the oscillation free shock capturing capability of the
hybrid schemes. Free parameters in the proposed compact least-squares schemes
are firstly optimized to reach a broad range of resolved bandwidths with
different levels of dissipation. In addition, a shock detector proposed in our
previous work is introduced and validated to be not only able to detect smooth
first-order extrema but also robust in detecting discontinuities. Through the
solution of block tridiagonal reconstruction linear systems, the resulting
schemes can give an explicit polynomial for each control volume and are
efficient with an acceptable computational overhead when compared to the pure
central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes. Eventually, benchmarks
including one-dimensional and two-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, inviscid
and viscous problems on uniform and nonuniform curvilinear grids demonstrate
the proposed schemes' promising applicability in compressible flows which have
both multiscale structures and discontinuities.

*Nuwan Rupasinghe,Sebastian Michel,Andreas Baumann,Julian Gerken,Samuel Gülde,Dirk Biermann,Peter Eberhard*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Ejector deep hole drilling can be optimized for efficiency by improving chip evacuation with flow-optimized drill heads, reducing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High fluid flow volumes in ejector drilling lead to energy inefficiency; optimizing chip evacuation can address this.

Method: Two flow-optimized drill heads and a reference were simulated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, then experimentally validated with additive manufacturing.

Result: Modified drill heads reduced vortex formation and improved flow, lowering the minimum fluid flow needed for stable drilling.

Conclusion: Optimized drill heads enable energy-efficient, sustainable ejector drilling by enhancing chip evacuation.

Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling offers great potential to utilize the typical
advantages of deep hole drilling processes on conventional machining centers in
a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. However, maintaining reliable
chip evacuation and stable process conditions often relies on high flow volumes
of metalworking fluid, resulting in considerable energy consumption in
industrial settings. Therefore, to analyze the highly sophisticated chip
evacuation dynamics of the process, two flow-optimized drill heads and a
reference drill head were evaluated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulation using experimentally obtained chip shapes. In addition, modified
drill heads were additively manufactured and experimentally investigated to
validate the numerical results and to determine the positive effect on the
necessary fluid flow for a stable ejector drilling process. The modifications
aim to improve chip evacuation by reducing vortex formation and optimizing flow
conditions near the cutting zone. Therefore, the minimum volume flow required
for a stable drilling process without chip clogging is reduced, leading to an
energy-efficient sustainable ejector drilling process.

*Mahmut Akilli*

TL;DR: The study measures neuron entropy using membrane ion current signals, proposing modified methods to align entropy peaks with ionic equilibrium, validated by the Logistic map and compared with Lyapunov exponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate entropy measurement in neuron cells and align entropy peaks with ionic equilibrium, addressing discrepancies in traditional methods.

Method: Used sample entropy and Scalogram entropy, modified to adjust entropy values to peak at ionic equilibrium, validated with the Logistic map and compared with Lyapunov exponents.

Result: Modified methods successfully aligned entropy peaks with equilibrium potential, suggesting potential applications in analyzing cell behavior, tumor detection, and drug effects.

Conclusion: Refined entropy measurements can effectively analyze neuron behavior, with broader implications for cell studies and medical applications.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate how the entropy of a neuron cell
can be measured using membrane ion current signals, which were recorded from
neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The sample entropy and
the Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well
known that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system
towards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity
of a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when
the membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic
equilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values
obtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium
state of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods
were proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium
potential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy
values were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions.
These refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map.
Additionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents. The
results show that the behaviour of living cells can be analysed using entropy
measurements. The results also suggest that the method could be used to detect
differences in the behaviour of tumour and normal cells, or the effects of
drugs on cells.

TL;DR: Existence of Yamabe metrics on four-manifolds with conical points using a min-max scheme in a singular setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of Yamabe metrics to manifolds with singularities, specifically four-manifolds with conical points.

Method: A min-max variational scheme in the singular setting, deforming regular bubbles into singular ones while controlling Yamabe energy.

Result: Proved existence of Yamabe metrics on such manifolds, leveraging positive mass theorems in the conical setting.

Conclusion: The study advances the theory of Yamabe metrics in singular geometries, with implications for conformal geometry.

Abstract: We prove existence of Yamabe metrics on four-manifolds possessing
finitely-many conical points with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-group, using for the first
time a min-max scheme in the singular setting. In our variational argument we
need to deform continuously regular bubbles into singular ones, while keeping
the Yamabe energy sufficiently low. For doing this, we exploit recent positive
mass theorems in the conical setting and study how the mass of the conformal
blow-up diverges as the blow-up point approaches the singular set.

### [93] [Flow Matching for Probabilistic Learning of Dynamical Systems from Missing or Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101)
*Siddharth Rout,Eldad Haber,Stephane Gaudreault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a flow matching variant for probabilistic forecasting in dynamical systems, addressing challenges like missing variables and noise. It also proposes a generative ML approach for state perturbation and validates the method on complex datasets like WeatherBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with ill-posed dynamical systems due to missing variables and noise. Stochastic ML techniques can model such systems, but probabilistic forecasting is needed to handle multiple plausible outputs.

Method: A flow matching variant for probabilistic forecasting and a generative ML approach for state perturbation, moving beyond Gaussian assumptions.

Result: The method effectively models uncertainty in high-dimensional dynamical systems, validated on datasets like WeatherBench.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances probabilistic forecasting for dynamical systems by addressing ill-posedness and non-Gaussian behavior, demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a sine-wave based activation function, to enhance neural network expressiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural networks rely on simple activation functions like ReLU, requiring large models for complex tasks. PLU aims to improve efficiency and expressive power.

Method: PLU is a learnable sine-wave activation with periodic non-monotonicity, paired with Repulsive Reparameterization to prevent collapse into linearity.

Result: A minimal MLP with two PLU neurons solves the spiral classification task, impossible for standard activations.

Conclusion: PLU enables exponential gains in parameter efficiency, shifting networks from piecewise approximators to Fourier-like synthesizers.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

*Colby Fronk,Linda Petzold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vanishing gradients in stiff neural ODEs, proving it's a universal issue for A-stable and L-stable methods, with sensitivity decay rates at best O(|z|^{-1}).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why parameter sensitivities vanish in stiff systems during training, hindering optimization in neural differential equations.

Method: Analyzes the rational stability function of stiff integration schemes, providing explicit formulas and proving decay rates.

Result: Shows vanishing gradients are inherent to A-stable/L-stable methods, with sensitivity decay bounded by O(|z|^{-1}).

Conclusion: Reveals a fundamental limitation in training stiff neural ODEs due to suppressed parameter gradients in all A-stable methods.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

*Yeongjong Kim,Yeoneung Kim,Minseok Kim,Namkyeong Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network (PINN-PI) framework is proposed for stochastic optimal control, leveraging policy iteration and HJB equations, with theoretical error bounds and demonstrated effectiveness on benchmark problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing stochastic optimal control problems with second-order HJB equations, the work aims to extend deterministic PINN methods to stochastic settings while ensuring interpretability and convergence.

Method: Uses neural networks to approximate value functions by minimizing residuals of linear PDEs from fixed policies, enabling systematic error control and Lipschitz-type bounds for policy updates.

Result: The method achieves global exponential convergence under mild conditions and performs well on stochastic cartpole, pendulum, and high-dimensional LQR problems.

Conclusion: PINN-PI provides a theoretically grounded and effective approach for stochastic optimal control, with interpretable error bounds and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

*Jean-David Jacques*

Main category: math.AC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize geometric deformations for post-Lie algebras and ensure their compatibility, particularly in the context of regularity structures and smooth vector bundles.

Method: Extends torsion and curvature concepts for bilinear operations on Lie algebras, derives compatibility conditions, and applies deformations to post-Lie algebras in regularity structures.

Result: A pre-Lie structure for regularity structures is derived, isomorphic to a post-Lie algebra at the Hopf algebra level, and includes a subalgebra from geometric moving frames.

Conclusion: The work successfully generalizes geometric deformations for post-Lie algebras, linking them to regularity structures and geometric contexts, providing new algebraic insights.

Abstract: In order to derive a class of geometric-type deformations of post-Lie
algebras, we first extend the geometrical notions of torsion and curvature for
a general bilinear operation on a Lie algebra, then we derive compatibility
conditions which will ensure that the post-Lie structure remains preserved.
This type of deformation applies in particular to the post-Lie algebra
introduced in arXiv:2306.02484v3 in the context of regularity structures
theory. We use this deformation to derive a pre-Lie structure for the
regularity structures approach given in arXiv:2103.04187v4, which is isomorphic
to the post-Lie algebra studied in arXiv:2306.02484v3 at the level of their
associated Hopf algebras. In the case of sections of smooth vector bundles of a
finite-dimensional manifold, this deformed structure contains also, as a
subalgebra, the post-Lie algebra structure introduced in arXiv:1203.4738v3 in
the geometrical context of moving frames.
