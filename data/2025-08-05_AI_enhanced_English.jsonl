This study employs automated chemical kinetic model\ngeneration to present a detailed microkinetic mechanism for Pt-catalyzed DRM\nbetween 700-1100 K, identifying key reaction pathways and kinetic limitations\nthrough sensitivity analysis.\n  Model predictions of CH4 and CO2 conversion and syngas production closely\nmatch fixed-bed experimental data across the entire temperature range and\nvaried feed ratios. Our predictive reaction network reveals that OCX serves as\na critical bottleneck intermediate for cooperative CH4 and CO2 activation.\nWhile CO desorption (OCX <=> CO + X) was identified as the most influential\nstep with strong negative sensitivity toward methane concentration, OCX\nregeneration (CO2X + CX <=> 2OCX) inhibits methane conversion by maintaining\nsurface saturation.\n  Methane activation follows sequential C-H scissions (CH4X -> CH3X -> CH2X ->\nCHX -> CX), while CO2 activation proceeds predominantly via a hydrogen-mediated\ncarboxyl route (CO2X + HX -> COOHX -> COX + OHX). Three operational regimes\nwere identified: low-temperature desorption-limited kinetics (700-850 K),\ntransitional pathway activation (850-950 K), and high-temperature distributed\ncontrol with carbon management challenges (950-1300 K).\n  These insights provide design principles for platinum-based DRM catalysts,\nemphasizing temperature-specific optimization strategies.

Since the asymptotic monodromy operator acts as a multiplication\noperator in the Fourier domain, it is possible to derive a formula for its\nspectrum.
