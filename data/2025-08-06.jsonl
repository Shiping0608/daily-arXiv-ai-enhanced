This paper focuses on\nrecovering generic orbits of functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere\n$S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover\ngeneric orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of\n$L^2({\\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and\ndiscretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly\nbounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from\nthe degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most\nimportant case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in\nparticular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications\nsuch as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for\n$SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the\nradial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an\nimplicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al. Our proof technique\nprovides an explicit, computationally efficient algorithm to recover the signal\nby successively solving systems of linear equations. We implemented this\nalgorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on two protein structures."}

These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition\nnumber between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to\nthe MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss.

Regarding mass\nconservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow\nthrough the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent\nrepresentation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate\npressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field.\nWe test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work\nEnergy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results\noutperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution. Additionally,\nwe find that the best results are achieved by computing the velocity field\nusing the PINN, which is then integrated into the vWERP framework, leading to\ntime super-sampled and high-order approximations, with a clinically admissible\naccuracy."}

Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in\nthe engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.\nIn this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam\nlattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By\napplying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of\nequations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this\nyields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with\nperiodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the\nexternal conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency\nmodes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the\nlow-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from\nclassical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the\ndecoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear\nalgebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement. Through dedicated\nanalysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice\nand continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for\nhomogenization errors.
