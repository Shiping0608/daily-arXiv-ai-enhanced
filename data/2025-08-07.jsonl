This study investigates the interaction between sawtooth\noscillations and energetic particles (EPs) using the initial-value MHD-kinetic\nhybrid code CLT-K, which can perform long-term self-consistent nonlinear\nsimulations. We analyze the redistribution of EPs caused by sawtooth crashes\nand the effect of EPs on sawtooth behavior and type transitions. The results\nshow that co-passing EPs tend to re-excite sawtooth oscillations, extending\ntheir period, while counter-passing EPs promote the system evolution toward\nsmall sawteeth, potentially leading to the steady-island state. Additionally,\nwe provide a physical picture of how EPs influence sawtooth type through the\nmechanism of magnetic flux pumping.

Most existing software packages\nintegrate the Fourier transform discretization tightly into their full-stack\nimplementations. This integrated design sacrifices generality, making it\ndifficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or\nproblem-specific requirements.

Here, it is confirmed experimentally that controlling\nparticles is possible also at a higher gas pressure of 90 mTorr, in a\ncapacitively coupled radio-frequency plasma (CCP). A timed application of a DC\nelectric field during the afterglow is a key element of this control scheme.\nAnalyzing the experimental results, the electric force in the late afterglow\nwas determined by comparing measurements of particle velocity to a prediction\nmade by integrating the equation of motion, taking into account gas friction.\nIn addition to applying friction to dust particles, gas also slows the drifting\nmotion of electrons and ions, reducing their energy during the afterglow, but\nnevertheless we find that dust particles become charged in the afterglow so\nthat one can apply an electric force to them that is comparable to the\ngravitational force, even at a higher pressure than had previously been\ndemonstrated.

The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs.

We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass.

We only require weak (entropy)\nsolutions of the hyperbolic approximations. Thereby, we provide a solid\nfoundation for these approximations, which have been used in the literature\nwithout rigorous convergence analysis. We also present numerical results that\nsupport our theoretical findings."}

By constructing estimates on a\ncausal rectangle reaching the conformal boundary, we prove that the solution\nadmits an asymptotic expansion near null and spatial infinity whose regularity\nis controlled quantitatively in terms of the regularity of the data at past\nnull infinity. In particular, our method gives rise to solutions to the wave\nequation in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity satisfying the peeling\nbehaviour, for data on past null infinity with non-compact support. Our\napproach makes use of Friedrich's conformal representation of spatial infinity\nin which we prove delicate non-degenerate Gr\\\"onwall estimates. We describe the\nrelationship between the solution and the data both in terms of Friedrich's\nconformal coordinates and the usual physical coordinates on Minkowski space."}
