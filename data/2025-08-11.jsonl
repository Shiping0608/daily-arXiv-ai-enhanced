Within this\nturbulent regime, two fundamental particle energization mechanisms emerge,\nstochastic acceleration and systematic acceleration. Systematic acceleration\nwithin open turbulent volumes promotes the development of power-law tails in\nenergy distributions. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of two electric\nfields: the perpendicular (or convective) fields, which drive stochastic\nheating via interactions with randomly moving scatterers, and the parallel\nelectric fields, which enable systematic particle acceleration in regions of\nstrong currents. Combined with accurate estimates of particle escape times in\nfinite volumes, the interplay of these mechanisms leads to the formation of\nKappa distributions. The transport properties differ significantly between the\ntwo energization modes. Stochastic energization follows Gaussian statistics and\ncan be effectively described by the Fokker-Planck equation.
