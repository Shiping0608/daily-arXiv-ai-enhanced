In this study, we\npresent a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a\ntime-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising\n3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of\nfour supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive\nset of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area\nUnder the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion\nmatrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the\nhighest accuracy (99.8\\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior\ngeneralization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\\%\naccuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\\%\naccuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and\ngeneralization at 95.8\\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority\nOver-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all\nmodels by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the\neffectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly\nRandom Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated\nexoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for\nimplementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National\nObservatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further\nadvance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts."}

The condition also extends naturally to unbounded\ndomains. In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but\nalso less restrictive than the classical Jenkins - Serrin criterion, ensuring\nthe existence of solutions in situations where that approach fail.

Learning\nbased on partial differential equations, such as the phase-field Allen-Cahn\nequation, allows efficient handling of semi-supervised learning approaches on\ngraphs. The numerical solution of the graph Allen-Cahn equation via a convexity\nsplitting or the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, albeit being a widely used\napproach, requires the calculation of a graph Laplacian eigendecomposition and\nrepeated projections over the unit simplex to maintain valid partitions. The\ncomputational efficiency of those methods is hence limited by those two\nbottlenecks in practice, especially when dealing with large-scale instances. In\norder to overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework combining a\nnovel penalty-based reformulation of the segmentation problem, which ensures\nvalid partitions (i.e., binary solutions) for appropriate parameter choices,\nwith an eigendecomposition and projection-free optimization scheme, which has a\nsmall per-iteration complexity (by relying primarily on sparse matrix-vector\nproducts) and guarantees good convergence properties.

In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal\ngradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W.\nStrong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense\nenergy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical\napproach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in\nirreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the\npresence of thermal gradients.
