We study a class of 2D edge Hamiltonians modeling a\nmedium which slowly interpolates between periodic bulk media via a domain wall\nacross a \"rational\" line defect. We consider the cases of (1) periodic bulk\nmedia having the symmetries of a square lattice, and (2) linear deformations of\nsuch media. Our bulk Hamiltonians break time-reversal symmetry due to\nperturbation by a magnetic term, which opens a band gap about the band\nstructure degeneracies of the unperturbed bulk Hamiltonian. In case (1), these\nare quadratic band degeneracies; in case (2), they are pairs of conical\ndegeneracies. We demonstrate that this band gap is traversed by two distinct\nedge state curves, consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence principle of\ntopological physics. Blow-ups of these curves near the bulk band degeneracies\nare described by effective (homogenized) edge Hamiltonians derived via\nmultiple-scale analysis which control the bifurcation of edge states. In case\n(1), the bifurcation is governed by a matrix Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator; in case\n(2), it is governed by a pair of Dirac operators.
