Using Jacobi-field expansions, these means\noccur as the r^2/6 coefficients in the intrinsic (d-1)-sphere and normal\n(n-d-1)-sphere volume elements. A direct consequence is a Bochner--Weitzenboeck\nidentity for simple d-vectors V (built from an orthonormal frame X_1,...,X_d\nwith Pi = span{X_i}): the curvature term equals d(n-d) times the normal mean\nRicci of Pi. This yields two immediate applications: (a) a Bochner vanishing\ncriterion for harmonic simple d-vectors under a positive lower bound on the\nnormal mean Ricci; and (b) a Lichnerowicz-type lower bound for the first\neigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian on simple d-eigenfields."}

The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product\nrepresentation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality\nassociated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb\ninteraction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction\nkernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor\nrepresentation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting\nscheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range\ncomponents. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank\nChebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition,\nrespectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in\ncomputing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves\nthe computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction,\nleading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the\nTNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the\nnew method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large\nand complex quantum systems."}

The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction\nwith limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp,\nunpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate.\nTo make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the\ntumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the\npursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied.\nNumerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions\nreveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled\nto adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely\nbefore the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to\npull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles\nforward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can\nsignificantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning\nwith the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the\ntarget motion.

The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect\noverall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this\nmultiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the\napplication of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use\nformal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for\nmacroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with\nperiodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We\nderive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with\nthe membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry.\nOur results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to\na wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes\nwith long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling\nconditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions\nin the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes\ncalled porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily\ndominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how\nalterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin\nexpression, might affect overall transport, including when external\nconcentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of\nphysical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and\nindustrial filtration to carbon capture."}

While\nconventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often\nresult in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such\nas time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models\nshow potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series\ngenerative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate\nhigh-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not\nentirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series\nSuper-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of\nupsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have\ninsufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning\nparadigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training\nrequires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in\nupsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,\nthis paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial\nTransformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth\nhigh-resolution data.
