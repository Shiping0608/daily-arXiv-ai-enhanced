The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two\nequations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of\ncriminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on\nchemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions,\nwe enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational\nformulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of\na finite element method.

We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem.

As a result, convergence issues with nonlinear solvers are common,\nwhich hinders the practical implementation of such models.\n  One particular source of difficulty for the nonlinear solvers comes from the\nfracture contact mechanics, due to its inherently nonsmooth character. In this\npaper, we investigate solvers based on the augmented Lagrangian formulation of\nthe frictional contact problem.

Ultrasound is transmitted through the\nskull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion,\nreducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models\nare frequently used for predicting beam aberration, assessing cranial heating,\nand correcting the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on\ncomputed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and\nestimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT\nlimits accuracy for differential equation solvers. This paper presents an\nefficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model\nfull-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull tissue. We have\nshown that this approach is highly accurate on relatively coarse meshes\ncompared to the minimum wavelength, enabling direct use of CT voxel data. The\nmethod is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an\naveraged skull representation. Simulations with a CT-based skull model and a\nbowl transducer show significant beam distortion and attenuation, with a focal\nshift of several millimeters from the homogeneous case."}

Understanding their functional possibilities on computational\ngrounds requires evaluating the response of the biperiodic layered system for\nmany degrees of freedom, including several radiation directions and\npolarisations, while varying lattice spacing, thicknesses, and/or materials of\nhomogeneous layers, over a range of frequencies. The diverse set of cases that\nneed to be considered in simulations prompts for efficient numerical tools to\nhandle them. To respond to this need, we present a method for computing the\nthermal radiation from metasurfaces that combines the directional Kirchhoff law\nwith efficient T-matrix based calculations. We show that such a method can\naccurately reproduce experimental data from a metasurface made of platinum\nsquare plates. Additionally, we predict highly circularly polarised emissivity\nfrom a chiral metasurface. When comparing CPU-times, the method outperforms\nother approaches such as rigorous coupled wave analysis already at the modest\nnumber of 61 cases per frequency."}

The approach exploits the inherent\nhierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for\nthe OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant\nmodes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds\nto a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with\nstandard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from\npreviously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving\ndynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our\nalgorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a\nfour times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.\nFurther, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the\nGreenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a\nROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000."}

While CNFs\ntypically define an anomaly score via a probabilistic likelihood, calculating\nthis score requires solving an Ordinary Differential Equation, a procedure too\ncomplex for FPGA deployment. To overcome this, we propose a novel,\nhardware-friendly anomaly score defined as the squared norm of the model's\nvector field output. This score is based on the intuition that anomalous events\nrequire a larger transformation by the flow. Our model, trained via Flow\nMatching on Standard Model-like data, is synthesized for an FPGA using the\nhls4ml library. We demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies a\nvariety of beyond-the-Standard-Model signatures with performance comparable to\nexisting machine learning-based triggers. The algorithm achieves a latency of a\nfew hundred nanoseconds and requires minimal FPGA resources, establishing CNFs\nas a viable new tool for real-time, data-driven discovery at 40 MHz."}
