A Vanka smoother and local spectral\ncoarse grids come with significant computational cost in the setup phase. To\navoid constructing a new solver for each time step and/or nonlinear iteration,\nwe utilize an implicit-explicit integration scheme in time, where we partition\nthe nonlinear operator as a sum of linear and nonlinear parts. In particular,\nwe construct an implicit linear approximation of the stiff components that\nremains fixed across all time, while treating the remaining nonlinear residual\nexplicitly. This allows us to construct a robust two-grid solver offline and\nutilize it for fast and efficient online time integration.

We consider both two- and three-dimensional\nsettings and prove the existence of nonlinear dielectric resonances in the\nsubwavelength regime, bifurcating from the zero solution at the corresponding\nlinear resonances. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic expansions for the\nnonlinear resonances and states in terms of the high contrast parameter $\\tau$\nand the normalization constant. For a symmetric dimer of resonators, these\nsmall-amplitude nonlinear resonant states exhibit either symmetric or\nantisymmetric profiles. In three dimensions, under conditions valid in the\ndilute regime, we prove that as the field amplitude increases, mode\nhybridization induces a symmetry-breaking bifurcation along the principal\nsymmetric solution branch at a critical amplitude. This bifurcation gives rise\nto two asymmetric resonant states, each localized on one of the particles in\nthe dimer. Remarkably, in two dimensions, we show that no such\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation exists along the principal solution branches,\nowing to the distinct scaling behavior of the principal nonlinear subwavelength\nresonance arising from the logarithmic singularity."}

Wavefunction-based theories, in\ncontrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when\napplied to realistic catalytic systems.

FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such\nas auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at\ncatalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of\nnonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable\nframework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy\nfor two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference\nsite of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface,\nwhere conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving\nquantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals\nwhy DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the\ncritical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics.

The flow field is\nmodeled using large-eddy simulations (LES), and the time-averaged output serves\nas input to acoustic models that predict wind turbine noise. In the first\nturbine row, turbulence-induced noise (TIN) and trailing edge noise (TEN)\ncontribute equally, with TIN dominating at low frequencies and TEN at higher\nfrequencies. Downstream, TEN decreases due to lower wind speeds, while TIN\nmostly persists due to increased turbulence dissipation. These effects are more\npronounced in aligned wind farms, where stronger wake interactions occur, than\nin staggered layouts. However, staggered farms produce more noise overall\nbecause turbines operate at higher wind speeds.Additionally, wind farm flow\nsignificantly affects sound propagation downwind. The wake superposition\nmodifies sound focusing leading to different amplification area than for an\nisolated turbine. For a staggered layout it particularly shows enhanced sound\nfocusing downwind due to the position of the turbine wakes. This leads to\nhigher sound levels and higher amplitude modulation downwind for the wind farm\ncompared to an aligned layout. These phenomena are not captured by models based\non isolated turbines.
