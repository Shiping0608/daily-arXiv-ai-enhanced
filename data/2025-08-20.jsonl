However, their spectral\nproperties are not optimal, which limits the ability to capture high-frequency\nwaves and small-scale features. In this paper, we propose a data-driven\noptimized method to improve the spectral properties of the WENO schemes. By\nanalyzing the approximate dispersion relation (ADR), the spectral error of the\nschemes can be bounded by the reconstructed errors of a series of trigonometric\nfunctions with different wavenumbers. Therefore, we propose the new schemes\nWENO5-JS/Z-NN that introduce a compensation term parameterized by a neural\nnetwork to the weight function of the WENO5-JS/Z schemes. The neural network is\ntrained such that the generated weights can minimize the reconstructed errors\nover a large number of spatial stencils, and furthermore, improve the spectral\naccuracy. Meanwhile, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) constraint and\nanti-dissipation penalization are incorporated into the loss function to\nenhance the shock-capturing capability and preserve stability in simulating\nhigh-frequency waves. Compared to WENO5-JS/Z, our schemes maintain the ability\nto capture discontinuities while providing higher resolution for fine-scale\nflow features.

The proposed scheme combines the compact gas-kinetic scheme\n(CGKS) with an adaptive stencil extension reconstruction with discontinuity\nfeedback factor (ASE-DFF), achieving significant improvements in both\nrobustness and computational efficiency. Traditional weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) schemes suffer from reduced robustness at higher order\nand require costly smoothness indicators for large stencils. Meanwhile, compact\nmethods based on Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR)\nstruggle with poor time-marching efficiency. In contrast, the ASE-DFF-CGKS\nintroduces two key innovations: (1) a unified framework enabling arbitrarily\nhigh-order compact gas-kinetic scheme without sacrificing large CFL number, and\n(2) a discontinuity feedback factor that eliminates the need for expensive\nsmoothness indicator calculations while essentially keeping first-order\nrobustness near discontinuities. The scheme's advantages are demonstrated\nthrough benchmark simulations. It maintains a CFL number above 0.5 for up to\n9th-order case, unlike conventional compact methods that restrict a CFL less\nthan 0.05.

We track capacity\ndynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization\nbottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization\nproblem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator\n(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a\ntarget bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via\ndistillation) stabilizes training.

We establish convergence, up to a\nsubsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a\nLeray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional\nregularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data. A discrete energy\ninequality yields a priori estimates, which we combine with a new compactness\nresult to prove precompactness of the approximations in\n$L^2([0,T]\\times\\Omega)$, where $[0,T]$ is the time interval and $\\Omega$ is\nthe spatial domain.

These media are\ncharacterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a\nhomogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances,\nwhich are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical\nparameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but\nwith a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that\nquasi-Minnaert resonances induce an invisibility cloaking effect in the\nhigh-contrast medium. These findings have significant implications for\nmathematical material science and the development of acoustic cloaking\ntechnologies."}
