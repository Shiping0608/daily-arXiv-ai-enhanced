To address this, we exploit the\nSherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to\ndesign an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that\nstrategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula,\nand the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of\nnon-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and\ncomputational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple\nnon-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite\nstrain."}

Recently, it has been shown how\nstability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can\nbe more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation\n(PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on\nan analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator,\n$\\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper,\nwe show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to\nmultiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of\nlifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain\nis well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which\nis necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate\nspatial differential operator,\n$D^\\alpha=\\partial_{s_1}^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots\\partial_{s_N}^{\\alpha_N}$, on the PDE\ndomain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra\nof Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable\nkernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any\nsuitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE,\nparameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for\nPDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of\npositive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the\nprocess of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is\nused to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining\naccurate bounds on the rate of decay."}

We describe\nhere a class of examples that exhibits how these leading-order effects do not\ncompletely describe the dynamics in the wake of the front. In fact, leading\nedge behavior predicts at most two possible invasion scenarios, associated with\npositive and negative amplitudes of the Gaussian tail, but our examples exhibit\nthree or more invasion fronts with different states in the wake.
