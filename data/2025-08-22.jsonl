Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to\nbalance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this\nbalance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with\nrespect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the\nscheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or\nthe basis functions that approximate the solution.\n  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating\npolynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is\n$\\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for\nsymmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for\na $p^\\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are\nnecessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in\nfinite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local\ndifferential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global\nintegral operators that yield dense matrices.\n  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle\nquadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one\ndimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our\nobservation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees\nconverge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular\nmeshes."}

First, the\nplasma density profile becomes asymmetric across the discharge, deviating from\nthe typical symmetric distribution seen in unmagnetized CCPs. Second, electron\nBernstein waves (EBWs), high-frequency electrostatic waves, are excited and\npropagate within the bulk plasma, particularly along steep electron density\ngradients. As the strength of the magnetic field increases within this regime,\nthe CCP discharge undergoes a transition from a symmetric configuration to an\nasymmetric one, and then returns to a symmetric profile at higher field\nstrengths.
