To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive\nneural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving\nweak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions\n-- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed\nframework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed\nsubintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence\nand solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and\nenhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients\nwithout explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error\nbounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the\nphysical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical\nexperiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently\noutperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both\naccuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients.\nThese results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization\ntechniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for\nnonlinear hyperbolic systems."}

A key focus is the strong damping of\nlarge-amplitude kink oscillations, which observational evidence suggests is\nnonlinear. However, directly identifying the nonlinearity is a challenge. This\nwork presents an analytic formula describing nonlinear standing kink\noscillations dissipated by turbulence, characterised by a time-varying damping\nrate and period drift. We investigate how the damping behaviour depends on the\ndriving amplitude and loop properties, showing that the initial damping time\n$\\tau$ is inversely proportional to the velocity disturbance over the loop\nradius, $V_i/R$. Using MCMC fitting with Bayesian inference, the nonlinear\nfunction better fits an observed decaying kink oscillation than traditional\nlinear models, including exponential damping, suggesting its nonlinear nature.\nBy applying a Bayesian model comparison, we establish regimes in which\nnonlinear and linear resonant absorption mechanisms dominate based on the\nrelationship between the damping rate $\\tau/P$ and $V_i/R$. Additionally,\nanalysis of two specific events reveals that while one favours the nonlinear\nmodel, the other is better explained by the linear model. Our results suggest\nthat this analytical approximation of nonlinear damping due to turbulence\nprovides a valid and reliable description of large-amplitude decaying kink\noscillations in coronal loops."}

A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion\nof their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work,\nwe developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the\nprobability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of\nactive rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment\nof wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution\nfunctions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods\naccumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the\ngoverning equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal\nvariable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to\nrigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish\nwell-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale\nderivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic\nsystem in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion.

Ensemble-based methods,\nsuch as the ensemble Kalman filter, approximate the evolution of the covariance\nthrough the propagation of individual ensemble members. Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical\nresults, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length\nscales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective\ndynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state\nestimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be\nremarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or\ntypical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a\nfundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the\ncontinuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact\ncontinuum covariance dynamics are known.

Ensemble-based methods,\nsuch as the ensemble Kalman filter, approximate the evolution of the covariance\nthrough the propagation of individual ensemble members. Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical\nresults, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length\nscales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective\ndynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state\nestimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be\nremarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or\ntypical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a\nfundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the\ncontinuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact\ncontinuum covariance dynamics are known. Errors in the ensemble covariances,\nwhich can be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of the mean\nstate when correlation lengths begin to approach grid scale, cannot be\nrectified by the usual methods, such as covariance inflation and localization.\nThis work brings to light a fundamental problem for data assimilation schemes\nthat propagate covariances using the same discrete dynamical model used to\npropagate the state."}
