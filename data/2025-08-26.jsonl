In this paper, we present\n\\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a\nclass of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump\nconditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout\nthe domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source\nevaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification\nwith reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be\nperformed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of\nthe Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we\nuse our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that\noutputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our\nsolution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our\nestimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\\mathcal{O}(1 /\n\\sqrt{\\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize\nnaturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that\nhave irregular geometry and in up to dimension six.

To our knowledge, this work is hence the first\njustification that the collisionless prediction matches those of collisional\nplasmas in the nonlinear equations.\n  The interaction between Landau damping and collisions requires several new\nideas:\n  (1) an infinite-regularity commuting vector field method, merged with Guo's\nweighted energy methods for the Landau operator and hypocoercivity to extract\nthe enhanced dissipation;\n  (2) A novel nearly-physical side treatment of the collisionless Vlasov\nechoes;\n  (3) A new set of decomposition methods to treat the effects of the nonlinear\ncollisions in the Volterra equation for the density (i.e., the ``collisional\nechoes'')\n  (4) A new quasi-linearization method for treating the effect of the slowly\nevolving homogeneous modes over long times.\n  As a side result, we also prove Landau damping and enhanced dissipation of\n$O(\\epsilon\\nu^{1/3})$ Sobolev-space perturbations of homogeneous distributions\nthat are only $O(\\epsilon)$ perturbations of global Maxwellians, generalizing\nthe recent results of Chaturvedi, Luk, and Nguyen.

In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep\nKolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with\nconvergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact\nsolution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep\nneural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in\nterms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and\nthe width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the\nnumber of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of\ninput-output data pairs used in the loss function), and in terms of the size of\nthe optimization error made by the employed stochastic optimization method."}

To achieve this, we introduce an enriched model that\ninterpolates between the CREM and the Ruelle probability cascade. We focus on\nthe weak correlation regime, where the CREM's covariance function $A$ is\nbounded above by the identity function.\n  In the weak correlation regime, we show that the free energy is given by the\nHopf formula. The resulting expression is independent of $A$, confirming that\nin this regime the free energy does not depend on the precise form of the\ncovariance function. Outside of the weak correlation regime, the\nHamilton--Jacobi framework no longer applies. Moreover, we provide an example\nwhere a formal application of the associated variational principle fails to\nyield the correct free energy."}

In the multi-scale setting, our\nresults match those of \\cite{IM} for long times but improve the short-time\nerror to $O(\\varepsilon)$. We also initiate the study of quasi-periodic\nhomogenization in this context. The scalar framework is further extended to\nhigher dimensions under a boundedness assumption on trajectories. For weakly\ncoupled systems with fast switching rates, we obtain for the first time a\nconvergence rate of order $O(\\varepsilon)$. These results have applications to\nlinear transport equations and broader connections to PDEs and gradient\nsystems."}

These\nvariables are obtained by smoothing an initially uncorrelated random field,\nwhich produces an exponentially decaying spatial correlation. The smoothing is\napplied implicitly and sequentially along the three coordinate directions of\nthe computational domain, making the approach suitable only for structured CFD\nsolvers. To extend the method to unstructured solvers, implicit Laplace\nsmoothing can be employed instead. However, the spatial correlation resulting\nfrom this alternative approach must be derived analytically. This constitutes\nthe main objective of the present dissertation."}

We present a general theorem\nabout the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic\nargument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also\nexplains the quantisation condition -- both the WKB structure and that rule are\nconfirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in\nwhich separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods."}
