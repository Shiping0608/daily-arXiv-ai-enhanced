### [1] [Walk-on-Interfaces: A Monte Carlo Estimator for an Elliptic Interface Problem with Nonhomogeneous Flux Jump Conditions and a Neumann Boundary Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16767)
*Xinwen Ding,Adam R Stinchcombe*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Walk-on-Interfaces (WoI) is a grid-free Monte Carlo method for Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jumps, providing consistent accuracy throughout the domain without close-to-source evaluation issues, and can be combined with deep learning for continuous solution representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elliptic interface problems model heterogeneous materials with discontinuous physical properties across interfaces, which are common in scientific and engineering applications but challenging to solve numerically.

Method: Grid-free Monte Carlo estimator called Walk-on-Interfaces (WoI) that handles Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump conditions, with variance reduction techniques and gradient estimation using Green's function gradients. Combined with deep neural networks for continuous solution representation.

Result: The method maintains consistent accuracy throughout the domain, avoids close-to-source evaluation issues near interfaces, provides gradient estimation at almost no additional cost, and demonstrates effectiveness in problems with many irregular interfaces up to dimension six.

Conclusion: WoI estimators are highly parallelizable, have O(1/√W) convergence rate, generalize naturally to higher dimensions, and when combined with deep learning, provide regularized continuous solutions that remove high-frequency Monte Carlo error, showing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Elliptic interface problems arise in numerous scientific and engineering
applications, modeling heterogeneous materials in which physical properties
change discontinuously across interfaces. In this paper, we present
\textit{Walk-on-Interfaces} (WoI), a grid-free Monte Carlo estimator for a
class of Neumann elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous flux jump
conditions. Our Monte Carlo estimators maintain consistent accuracy throughout
the domain and, thus, do not suffer from the well-known close-to-source
evaluation issue near the interfaces. We also presented a simple modification
with reduced variance. Estimation of the gradient of the solution can be
performed, with almost no additional cost, by simply computing the gradient of
the Green's function in WoI. Taking a scientific machine learning approach, we
use our estimators to provide training data for a deep neural network that
outputs a continuous representation of the solution. This regularizes our
solution estimates by removing the high-frequency Monte Carlo error. All of our
estimators are highly parallelizable, have a $\mathcal{O}(1 /
\sqrt{\mathcal{W}})$ convergence rate in the number of samples, and generalize
naturally to higher dimensions. We solve problems with many interfaces that
have irregular geometry and in up to dimension six. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and to highlight its potential in
solving problems motivated by real-world applications.

### [2] [Harmonic potentials in the de Rham complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16822)
*Martin Campos Pinto,Julian Owezarek*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to construct vector potentials for harmonic fields tangent to boundaries in domains with tunnels, addressing a gap in representing such fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to represent vector fields using scalar or vector potentials in domains with cavities or tunnels due to harmonic fields that are both irrotational and solenoidal but lack proper potentials.

Method: The authors develop vector potentials by solving curl-curl problems with inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions fitted to closed curves around tunnels, using structure-preserving finite elements.

Result: The method successfully constructs vector potentials that form a basis for tangent harmonic fields and provides an exact geometric parametrization of discrete harmonic fields.

Conclusion: This work fills a theoretical gap by providing a construction method for vector potentials of tangent harmonic fields in tunnel-containing domains, enabling better representation of vector fields in complex geometries.

Abstract: Representing vector fields by scalar or vector potentials can be a
challenging task in domains with cavities or tunnels, due to the presence of
harmonic fields which are both irrotational and solenoidal but may have no
scalar or vector potentials. For harmonic fields normal to the boundary, which
can exist in domains with cavities, it is possible to define scalar potentials
with Dirichlet boundary conditions fitted to the domain's cavities. For
harmonic fields tangent to the boundary, which can exist in domains with
tunnels, a similar construction was lacking. In this article we present a
construction of vector potentials that yield a basis for the tangent harmonic
fields. Our vector potentials are obtained by solving curl-curl problems with
inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions that are fitted to closed curves
looping around the tunnels. Applied to structure-preserving finite elements,
our method also provides an exact geometric parametrization of the discrete
harmonic fields.

### [3] [Enhanced shape recovery in advection--diffusion problems via a novel ADMM-based CCBM optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16898)
*Elmehdi Cherrat,Lekbir Afraites,Julius Fergy Tiongson Rabago*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel shape optimization framework for geometric inverse problems using coupled complex boundary method (CCBM) with ADMM-inspired scheme to handle concave boundaries and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover unknown inclusion shapes in advection-diffusion problems, addressing difficulties with concave boundaries under measurement noise and combined advection-diffusion effects.

Method: Shape optimization driven by cost functional from imaginary part of complex-valued state variable, using Sobolev gradient method in finite element framework with ADMM-inspired numerical scheme.

Result: Rigorous derivation of shape derivative in variational form, explicit gradient and second-order expressions, and development of efficient CCBM-ADMM scheme using partial gradients.

Conclusion: Proposed computational approach demonstrates accuracy and robustness through various numerical experiments, providing effective solution for shape recovery in challenging inverse problems.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel shape optimization framework for geometric inverse
problems governed by the advection-diffusion equation, based on the coupled
complex boundary method (CCBM). Building on recent developments [2, 45, 46, 47,
51], we aim to recover the shape of an unknown inclusion via shape optimization
driven by a cost functional constructed from the imaginary part of the
complex-valued state variable over the entire domain. We rigorously derive the
associated shape derivative in variational form and provide explicit
expressions for the gradient and second-order information. Optimization is
carried out using a Sobolev gradient method within a finite element framework.
To address difficulties in reconstructing obstacles with concave boundaries,
particularly under measurement noise and the combined effects of advection and
diffusion, we introduce a numerical scheme inspired by the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). In addition to implementing this
non-conventional approach, we demonstrate how the adjoint method can be
efficiently applied and utilize partial gradients to develop a more efficient
CCBM-ADMM scheme. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational
approach are validated through various numerical experiments.

### [4] [Iterative Methods for Computing the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse of Quaternion Matrices, with Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16979)
*Valentin Leplat,Salman Ahmadi-Asl,JunJun Pan,Ning Zheng*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel iterative methods for computing quaternion matrix pseudoinverses directly in quaternion space, featuring damped Newton-Schulz iterations, hyperpower schemes, and randomized/conjugate gradient approaches with superior performance in large-scale applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient and accurate computational methods for quaternion matrix pseudoinverses that operate directly in quaternion space, avoiding complex conversions and enabling practical applications in image processing and inverse problems.

Method: Developed multiple iterative approaches: damped Newton-Schulz iteration with spectral scaling, higher-order hyperpower NS schemes with optimized factorizations, randomized sketch-and-project method (RSP-Q), and conjugate gradient on normal equations (CGNE-Q).

Result: Spectrally-scaled Newton-Schulz achieves superior accuracy and runtime. NS family delivers state-of-the-art performance with lowest wall time in applications like image completion, filtering, and deblurring.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative methods provide efficient solvers for large-scale quaternion inverse problems, with Newton-Schulz family showing particularly strong performance in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We develop iterative methods to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of
quaternion matrices directly in $\mathbb{H}$. We introduce a damped
Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration, proving its convergence under spectral scaling
$X_0=\alpha A^H$ with $\alpha\in(0,2/\|A\|_2^2)$. We derive higher-order
hyperpower NS schemes with optimized factorizations. Beyond NS, we propose a
randomized sketch-and-project method (RSP-Q) and a conjugate gradient on normal
equations (CGNE-Q). Numerically, spectrally-scaled NS achieves superior
accuracy and runtime. In applications (image completion, filtering,
deblurring), the NS family delivers state-of-the-art performance with the
lowest wall time, providing efficient solvers for large-scale quaternion
inverse problems.

### [5] [Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for multi-material elasticity problems in electronic packaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16999)
*Yanpeng Gong,Yida He,Yue Mei,Xiaoying Zhuang,Fei Qin,Timon Rabczuk*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: PIKAN method uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with physics-informed constraints for multi-material elasticity analysis, eliminating need for domain decomposition while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks require domain decomposition and penalty terms for multi-material problems, which increases computational complexity and implementation difficulty.

Method: Replaces MLPs with KANs in PINNs framework, uses trainable B-spline activation functions to naturally handle material discontinuities, constructs admissible displacement fields satisfying boundary conditions, and employs numerical integration for loss computation.

Result: Achieves accurate approximation across entire computational domain with single network, maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to domain decomposition approaches.

Conclusion: PIKAN demonstrates unique advantages for multi-material elasticity problems and shows significant potential for electronic packaging structure analysis with reduced computational burden.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
method for analyzing elasticity problems in electronic packaging multi-material
structures. The core innovation lies in replacing Multi-Layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within the energy-based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework. The method constructs
admissible displacement fields that automatically satisfy essential boundary
conditions and employs various numerical integration schemes to compute loss
functions for network optimization. Unlike traditional PINNs that require
domain decomposition and penalty terms for multi-material problems, KANs'
trainable B-spline activation functions provide inherent piecewise function
characteristics that naturally accommodate material property discontinuities.
Consequently, this approach requires only a single KAN to achieve accurate
approximation across the entire computational domain without subdomain
partitioning and interface continuity constraints. Numerical validation
demonstrates PIKAN's accuracy and robustness for multi-material elasticity
problems. The method maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational complexity compared to domain decomposition approaches. Results
confirm PIKAN's unique advantages in solving multi-material problems and its
significant potential for electronic packaging structure analysis. Source codes

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Second-order implicit-explicit BDF-Galerkin scheme for nonlinear thermistor problem with unconditional superconvergence


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and accurate numerical method for solving time-dependent nonlinear thermistor problems with second-order accuracy and unconditional stability

Method: Combines second-order backward differentiation formula with special extrapolation terms for time discretization and standard finite elements for spatial discretization. Uses time-discrete system for error decomposition and superclose error estimates for handling nonlinear coupling.

Result: Unconditionally superclose and superconvergent error estimates are established. Numerical examples validate theoretical findings, demonstrating unconditional stability and second-order accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed implicit-explicit BDF-Galerkin scheme provides an effective second-order accurate method for nonlinear thermistor problems with proven unconditional stability and superconvergence properties.

Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes an implicit-explicit BDF-Galerkin scheme of
second order for the time-dependent nonlinear thermistor problem. For this, we
combine the second-order backward differentiation formula with special
extrapolation terms for time discretization with standard finite elements for
spatial discretization. Unconditionally superclose and superconvergent error
estimates are established, relying on two key techniques. First, a
time-discrete system is introduced to decompose the error function into its
temporal and spatial components. Second, superclose error estimates between the
numerical solution and the interpolation of the time-discrete solution are
employed to effectively handle the nonlinear coupling term. Finally, we present
numerical examples that validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the
unconditional stability and the second-order accuracy of the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we systematically define and characterize various classes of
Bohemian matrices with respect to the population $\mathbb{P}=\{0, \pm 1\}$,
focusing on their inner and outer Bohemian inverses. The classes under
consideration include rank-one Bohemian matrices, as well as higher-rank
Bohemian matrix classes, specifically Classes I, II, and III. For rank-one
Bohemian matrices, a complete description of the outer Bohemian inverse sets is
provided along with their cardinalities. Additionally, new insights into inner
Bohemian inverses and their cardinalities are given. Characterizations of the
complete set of inner inverses for the Class III matrices and full-row rank
Class II matrices are obtained. Furthermore, we study the sets of rank-one
outer inverses for Classes I and II, and examine the sets of rank $r$ outer
inverses for full-row rank Class II matrices of rank $r$. Moreover, the set of
outer inverses is completely characterized for rank-two full-row rank Class III
matrices. In particular, we provide an explicit formula for the cardinality of
the set of outer Bohemian inverses for rank-two full-row rank Class I matrices.

the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) scheme is one of their building blocks.
Secondly we provide some intrinsic bound preserving properties. This is also
illustrated numericaly. Last, we show, at least in one dimension, that the
PAMPA scheme has the Summation by part property.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous error analysis and convergence rates for the deep Kolmogorov method when applied to heat PDEs, addressing the theoretical foundations of this popular deep learning approach.

Method: Analyzes the mean square distance between exact PDE solutions and DNN approximations, considering DNN architecture (depth/width), number of sample points in loss function, and optimization algorithm errors.

Result: Reveals convergence with specific convergence rates for the deep Kolmogorov method applied to heat PDEs, quantifying error bounds based on network size, sample complexity, and optimization performance.

Conclusion: The deep Kolmogorov method demonstrates provable convergence properties for heat PDEs, with error bounds that can be controlled through appropriate selection of DNN architecture, sample size, and optimization algorithms.

Abstract: The deep Kolmogorov method is a simple and popular deep learning based method
for approximating solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the
Kolmogorov type. In this work we provide an error analysis for the deep
Kolmogorov method for heat PDEs. Specifically, we reveal convergence with
convergence rates for the overall mean square distance between the exact
solution of the heat PDE and the realization function of the approximating deep
neural network (DNN) associated with a stochastic optimization algorithm in
terms of the size of the architecture (the depth/number of hidden layers and
the width of the hidden layers) of the approximating DNN, in terms of the
number of random sample points used in the loss function (the number of

### [10] [A Relaxed Step-Ratio Constraint for Time-Fractional Cahn--Hilliard Equations: Analysis and Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17178)
*Shipeng Li,Hengfei Ding*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents improved numerical methods for time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equations by relaxing step-size ratio constraints from previous work, enabling more flexible time-step selection while maintaining accuracy and stability properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical solutions of time-fractional differential equations face challenges due to solution singularities at initial time. Existing methods had restrictive step-size ratio constraints that limited flexibility in time-step selection.

Method: The authors introduce innovative splitting techniques to relax step-size ratio restrictions, propose a refined L2-type temporal approximation with fourth-order compact difference spatial discretization, and construct specialized nonuniform meshes that satisfy the relaxed constraints.

Result: The method achieves significantly greater flexibility in time-step selection (relaxed constraint ρ*(α) > 4.7476114 vs previous 0.3960 ≤ τ_k/τ_{k-1} ≤ r*(α) with r*(α) ≥ 4.660), while maintaining unique solvability, exact discrete volume conservation, proper energy dissipation laws, and optimal convergence rates.

Conclusion: The work provides substantial theoretical progress in time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation numerical methods by relaxing step-size constraints, enabling more practical and flexible implementations while preserving essential mathematical properties.

Abstract: Numerical solutions of time-fractional differential equations encounter
significant challenges arising from solution singularities at the initial time.
To address this issue, the construction of nonuniform temporal meshes
satisfying $\tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \geq 1$ has emerged as an effective strategy,
where $\tau_k$ represents the $k$-th time-step size. For the time-fractional
Cahn-Hilliard equation, Liao et al.~[\textit{IMA J. Numer. Anal.}, \textbf{45}
(2025), 1425--1454] developed an analytical framework using a variable-step L2
formula with the constraint $0.3960 \leq \tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \leq r^*(\alpha)$,
where $r^*(\alpha) \geq 4.660$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$. The present work makes
substantial theoretical progress by introducing innovative splitting techniques
that relax the step-size ratio restriction to $\tau_k/\tau_{k-1} \leq
\rho^*(\alpha)$, with $\rho^*(\alpha) > \overline{\rho} \approx 4.7476114$.
This advancement provides significantly greater flexibility in time-step
selection. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a refined
L2-type temporal approximation coupled with a fourth-order compact difference
spatial discretization, yielding an efficient numerical scheme for the
time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard problem. Our rigorous analysis establishes the
scheme's fundamental properties, including unique solvability, exact discrete
volume conservation, proper energy dissipation laws, and optimal convergence
rates. For practical implementation, we construct a specialized nonuniform mesh
that automatically satisfies the relaxed constraint $\rho^*(\alpha) >
4.7476114$.

### [11] [A Variable-Separation-based Domain Decomposition Method for Parametric Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17276)
*Yuming Ba,Liang Chen,Yaru Chen,Qiuqi Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A model order reduction method for parametric dynamical systems using Fourier transform to convert to complex-valued elliptic equations, with offline-online domain decomposition for efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost for parametric dynamical systems by transforming them into frequency-domain elliptic equations and enabling efficient online solutions independent of spatial discretization.

Method: Uses temporal Fourier integral transform to reformulate systems into complex-valued elliptic equations, extends variable-separation-based domain decomposition to complex context, with offline construction of solution representations and online computation for new parameters.

Result: The method creates an efficient offline-online procedure where online solutions can be derived quickly using precomputed representations, independent of spatial discretization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively reduces computational cost for parametric dynamical systems through frequency-domain transformation and domain decomposition, demonstrated through three specific system instances.

Abstract: This paper proposes a model order reduction method for a class of parametric
dynamical systems. Using a temporal Fourier integral transform, we reformulate
these systems into complex-valued elliptic equations in the frequency domain,
containing both the frequency variables and the parameters inherited from the
original model. To reduce the computational cost of the frequency-variable
elliptic equations, we extend the variable-separation-based domain
decomposition method to the complex-valued context, resulting in an
offline-online procedure for solving the parametric dynamical systems. In the
offline stage, separate representations of the solutions for the interface
problem and the subproblems are constructed. In the online stage for new
parameter values, the solutions of the parametric dynamical systems can be
directly derived by utilizing the separate representations and implementing the
inverse Fourier transform. The proposed approach is capable of being highly
efficient because the online stage is independent of the spatial
discretization. Finally, we present three specific instances for parametric
dynamical systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*S. Dargaville,R. P. Smedley-Stevenson,P. N. Smith,C. C. Pain*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: AIRG multigrid with GMRES polynomials and PMISR DDC splitting enables efficient parallel solution of hyperbolic systems on GPUs with good weak scaling for linear advection equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hyperbolic system solvers (Gauss-Seidel, sweep methods) have poor parallel scalability, especially for complex discretizations and mesh decompositions, limiting their effectiveness on modern GPU architectures.

Method: Combines AIRG reduction multigrid using GMRES polynomials with PMISR DDC CF splitting algorithm. Uses matrix-free GMRES polynomials as smoothers (low order) and approximate coarse grid solvers (high order), with automatic hierarchy truncation based on polynomial quality.

Result: Achieved 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in solve phase and 47-63% in setup phase across Lumi-G pre-exascale GPU machine for 2D time-independent advection equations on structured grids.

Conclusion: The AIRG-PMISR DDC combination provides an effective parallel solution for hyperbolic systems on GPUs, with GMRES polynomials being particularly well-suited for GPU architectures when applied matrix-free.

Abstract: Methods for solving hyperbolic systems typically depend on unknown ordering
(e.g., Gauss-Seidel, or sweep/wavefront/marching methods) to achieve good
convergence. For many discretisations, mesh types or decompositions these
methods do not scale well in parallel. In this work we demonstrate that the
combination of AIRG (a reduction multigrid which uses GMRES polynomials) and
PMISR DDC (a CF splitting algorithm which gives diagonally dominant
submatrices) can be used to solve linear advection equations in parallel on
GPUs with good weak scaling. We find that GMRES polynomials are well suited to
GPUs when applied matrix-free, either as smoothers (at low order) or as an
approximate coarse grid solver (at high order). To improve the parallel
performance we automatically truncate the multigrid hierarchy given the quality
of the polynomials as coarse grid solvers. Solving time-independent advection
equations in 2D on structured grids, we find 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in
the solve and 47-63% in the setup with AIRG, across the majority of Lumi-G, a
pre-exascale GPU machine.

### [13] [A convergence framework for energy minimisation of linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs in nonlinear approximation spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17687)
*Alexandre Magueresse,Santiago Badia*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A theoretical optimization framework for energy minimization problems from linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs using nonlinear approximation spaces, with proven convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of theoretical analysis and convergence guarantees for nonlinear PDE solvers like physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), despite their practical success.

Method: Develops a general optimization framework with hybrid strategy: linear parameters updated via linear solves/steepest descent, nonlinear parameters via constrained projected descent. Uses modular structural assumptions on discrete energy functional.

Result: Establishes both local and global convergence under abstract assumptions (differentiability, boundedness, regularity, directional convexity), making framework applicable to broad class of nonlinear approximation manifolds.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous theoretical foundation for nonlinear PDE solvers with convergence guarantees, complemented by concrete implementation using overlapping free-knot tensor-product B-splines in companion paper.

Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of nonlinear methods for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs). While these approaches often perform well in practice, their
theoretical analysis remains limited, especially regarding convergence
guarantees. This work develops a general optimisation framework for energy
minimisation problems arising from linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs,
formulated over nonlinear but analytically tractable approximation spaces. The
framework accommodates a natural split between linear and nonlinear parameters
and supports hybrid optimisation strategies: linear variables are updated via
linear solves or steepest descent, while nonlinear variables are handled using
constrained projected descent. We establish both local and global convergence
of the resulting algorithm under modular structural assumptions on the discrete
energy functional, including differentiability, boundedness, regularity, and
directional convexity. These assumptions are stated in an abstract form,
allowing the framework to apply to a broad class of nonlinear approximation
manifolds. In a companion paper, we introduce a concrete instance of such a
space based on overlapping free-knot tensor-product B-splines, which satisfies
the required assumptions and enables geometrically adaptive solvers with
rigorous convergence guarantees.

### [14] [Energy minimisation using overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-splines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17705)
*Alexandre Magueresse,Santiago Badia*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Nonlinear free-knot B-spline method for adaptive PDE solving with local convergence guarantees and fewer degrees of freedom than traditional FEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods like finite elements are ineffective for PDEs with localized features due to geometric rigidity and computational expense of adaptive refinement strategies. Existing adaptive methods require problem-specific error estimates and solving on multiple meshes.

Method: Overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-spline patches where knot positions act as nonlinear parameters controlling discretization geometry. Energy minimization for linear self-adjoint elliptic PDEs with constrained optimization of knot positions and coefficients.

Result: Under mild mesh size conditions, the discrete energy satisfies structural properties required for local and global convergence. Numerical experiments show efficiency and ability to capture localized features with significantly fewer degrees of freedom than standard FEM.

Conclusion: The free-knot B-spline space fits into the abstract optimization framework, ensuring convergence of projected gradient descent for joint optimization of geometry and coefficients, providing an effective adaptive approach for PDEs with localized features.

Abstract: Accurately solving PDEs with localised features requires refined meshes that
adapt to the solution. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite elements,
are linear in nature and often ineffective for such problems, as the mesh is
not tailored to the solution. Adaptive strategies, such as $h$- and
$p$-refinement, improve efficiency by sequentially refining the mesh based on a
posteriori error estimates. However, these methods are geometrically rigid --
limited to specific refinement rules -- and require solving the problem on a
sequence of adaptive meshes, which can be computationally expensive. Moreover,
the design of effective a posteriori error estimates is problem-dependent and
non-trivial. In this work, we study a specific nonlinear approximation scheme
based on overlapping tensor-product free-knot B-spline patches, where knot
positions act as nonlinear parameters controlling the geometry of the
discretisation. We analyse the corresponding energy minimisation problem for
linear, self-adjoint elliptic PDEs, showing that, under a mild mesh size
condition, the discrete energy satisfies the structural properties required for
the local and global convergence of the constrained optimisation scheme
developed in our companion work [Magueresse, Badia, arXiv (2025)]. This
establishes a direct connection between the two analyses: the adaptive
free-knot B-spline space considered here fits into the abstract framework,
ensuring convergence of projected gradient descent for the joint optimisation
of knot positions and coefficients. Numerical experiments illustrate the
method's efficiency and its ability to capture localised features with
significantly fewer degrees of freedom than standard finite element
discretisations.

### [15] [Spectral-Prior Guided Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Highly Accurate PDE Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17902)
*Yuzhen Li,Liang Li,Stéphane Lanteri,Bin Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel methods - SI-MSPINNs and RFF-MSPINNs - that significantly improve PINN accuracy by incorporating spectral analysis and multistage optimization strategies to address spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) show promise for solving PDEs but suffer from limited accuracy in practical applications, primarily due to spectral bias issues that constrain their performance.

Method: Two approaches: 1) SI-MSPINNs extract Dominant Spectral Patterns from residuals using discrete Fourier transform to guide network initialization and multistage optimization; 2) RFF-MSPINNs combine random Fourier features with spectral weighting to dynamically adjust frequency sampling based on residual power spectral density.

Result: Experimental verification on Burgers equation and Helmholtz equation demonstrates that both proposed models significantly improve accuracy compared to original PINNs.

Conclusion: The spectral-prior guided multistage strategy effectively addresses spectral bias in PINNs, leading to substantial accuracy improvements for solving PDEs while maintaining the mesh-free and high-dimensional advantages of neural network approaches.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are becoming a popular method for
solving PDEs, due to their mesh-free nature and their ability to handle
high-dimensional problems where traditional numerical solvers often struggle.
Despite their promise, the practical application of PINNs is still constrained
by several fac- tors, a primary one being their often-limited accuracy. This
paper is dedicated to enhancing the accuracy of PINNs by introducing
spectral-prior guided multistage strategy. We propose two methods: Spectrum-
Informed Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SI-MSPINNs) and
Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Spectrum Weighted Random
Fourier Features (RFF-MSPINNs). The SI-MSPINNs integrate the core mechanism of
Spectrum-Informed Multistage Neural Network (SI-MSNNs) and PINNs, in which we
extract the Dominant Spectral Pattern (DSP) of residuals by the discrete
Fourier transform. This DSP guides the network initialization to alleviate
spectral bias, and gradually optimizes the resolution accuracy using a
multistage strategy. The RFF-MSPINNs combines random Fourier features with
spectral weighting methods, dynamically adjusting the frequency sampling
distribution based on the residual power spectral density, allowing the network
to prioritize learning high-energy physical modes. Through experimental
verification of the Burgers equation and the Helmholtz equation, we show that
both models significantly improve the accuracy of the original PINNs.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A high-order Discontinuous Galerkin solver for compressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically designed for vortex-induced vibration problems with polynomial orders p≥4 on parallel architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate and efficient numerical methodology for technological and industrial applications in subsonic regions, particularly for vortex-induced vibration problems that require high-order accuracy.

Method: Nodal DG method on triangular grids with Roe approximate Riemann solver for advection terms and Interior-Penalty flux for diffusion terms, coupled with explicit Runge-Kutta time integration and implicit rigid body dynamics.

Result: Successfully implemented polynomial orders p≥4 for laminar compressible Navier-Stokes, validated with experimental data for circular cylinder cases, and demonstrated capability for complex fluid-structure-interaction problems.

Conclusion: The DG framework proves to be an accurate, efficient, and arbitrary-order numerical methodology suitable for high-fidelity fluid-structure-interaction problems in industrial applications.

Abstract: We present a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) solver for the compressible
Navier-Stokes system, designed for applications of technological and industrial
interest in the subsonic region. More precisely, this work aims to exploit the
DG-discretised Navier-Stokes for two dimensional vortex-induced vibration (VIV)
problems allowing for high-order of accuracy. The numerical discretisation
comprises a nodal DG method on triangular grids, that includes two types of
numerical fluxes: 1) the Roe approximate Riemann solver flux for non-linear
advection terms, and 2) an Interior-Penalty numerical flux for non-linear
diffusion terms. The nodal formulation permits the use of high order polynomial
approximations without compromising computational robustness. The
spatially-discrete form is integrated in time using a low-storage
strong-stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and is coupled weakly
with an implicit rigid body dynamics algorithm. The proposed algorithm
successfully implements polynomial orders of $p\ge 4$ for the laminar
compressible Navier-Stokes equations in massively parallel architectures. The
resulting framework is firstly tested in terms of its convergence properties.
Then, numerical solutions are validated with experimental and numerical data
for the case of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds number, and lastly, the
methodology is employed to simulate the problem of an elastically-mounted
cylinder, a known configuration characterised by significant computational
challenges. The above results showcase that the DG framework can be employed as
an accurate and efficient, arbitrary order numerical methodology, for high
fidelity fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) problems.

*Danielle Bednarski,Tim Roith*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Lecture notes on mathematical concepts in inverse problems, covering classical regularization theory and modern deep-learning approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of mathematical foundations and modern computational methods for solving inverse problems, which are inherently ill-posed and require specialized techniques for stable reconstruction.

Method: Structured approach starting with inverse problem examples, then classical regularization theory in Hilbert spaces (pseudo-inverse, convergent regularization), followed by practical algorithms like Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization, and finally modern deep-learning methods including learned regularization, Bayesian estimation, post-processing, and plug-n-play approaches.

Result: A systematic educational framework that bridges classical mathematical theory with contemporary machine learning techniques for solving inverse problems across various domains including differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography, and phase retrieval.

Conclusion: The lecture notes successfully integrate traditional mathematical foundations of inverse problems with cutting-edge deep learning methods, providing a comprehensive resource that addresses both theoretical well-posedness considerations and practical reconstruction algorithms for modern applications.

Abstract: These lecture notes evolve around mathematical concepts arising in inverse
problems. We start by introducing inverse problems through examples such as
differentiation, deconvolution, computed tomography and phase retrieval. This
then leads us to the framework of well-posedness and first considerations
regarding reconstruction and inversion approaches. The second chapter then
first deals with classical regularization theory of inverse problems in Hilbert
spaces. After introducing the pseudo-inverse, we review the concept of
convergent regularization. Within this chapter we then proceed to ask the
question of how to realize practical reconstruction algorithms. Here, we mainly
focus on Tikhonov and sparsity promoting regularization in finite dimensional
spaces. In the third chapter, we dive into modern deep-learning methods, which
allow solving inverse problems in a data-dependent approach. The intersection
between inverse problems and machine learning is a rapidly growing field and
our exposition here restricts itself to a very limited selection of topics.
Among them are learned regularization, fully-learned Bayesian estimation,
post-processing strategies and plug-n-play methods.

TL;DR: Inverse coefficient problem for fractional Schrödinger equations with drift on Riemannian manifolds - can determine metric, drift, and potential simultaneously from data on any open subset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous results for principal terms and achieve simultaneous inversion of all terms (Riemannian metric, drift, and potential) in variable-coefficient fractional Schrödinger equations.

Method: Uses a novel Runge approximation technique for fractional PDEs on Riemannian manifolds to prove unique determination up to gauge transformation.

Result: Proves that equation knowledge on any non-empty open subset uniquely determines the Riemannian metric, drift, and potential simultaneously.

Conclusion: Successfully extends previous work by enabling simultaneous inversion of all terms using novel fractional PDE approximation methods on manifolds.

Abstract: This paper is concerned about the inverse coefficient problems of
variable-coefficient fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on
connected closed Riemannian manifolds. We prove that the knowledge of the
underlying equation on any non-empty open subset of the underlying manifold
determines the Riemannian metric, the drift and the potential, simultaneously
and uniquely, up to a gauge transformation. This paper extends the result in
\cite{feizmohammadi2021fractionalanisotropiccalderonproblem} for principal
terms. Not only can we retrieve lower order terms, but we are also able to
achieve the simultaneous inversion of all terms. The key ingredient is a novel
Runge approximation of fractional PDEs on Riemannian manifolds.

TL;DR: Analysis of acoustic wave motion control and stochastic behavior using boundary forces


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the controllability of acoustic wave systems through boundary forces and understand their stochastic behavior under random perturbations

Method: Established observability inequality as the bridge between deterministic control and stochastic analysis, proving exact controllability for suitable boundary controls and strong mixing for white noise perturbations

Result: The acoustic wave system is exactly controllable with proper boundary control, and exhibits strong mixing behavior when subjected to white noise type random perturbations

Conclusion: Observability inequality serves as the fundamental connection between deterministic control theory and stochastic analysis for acoustic wave systems, enabling both exact controllability and characterization of stochastic behavior

Abstract: This paper concerns the dynamical behaviors of acoustic wave motion driven by
a force acting through the boundary. If the boundary force is a suitable
control, we show that the dynamical system associated to the acoustic wave
motion is exactly controllable. Furthermore, when it is random perturbation of
white noise type, we prove that the corresponding stochastic system is strong
mixing. The bridge between these two problems is the observability inequality,
which will be established in this work.

TL;DR: Uniqueness of transonic shock solutions in 2D Riemannian manifolds with special metrics, proving unique solutions exist for given supersonic upstream flow and uniform exit pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study transonic shock uniqueness in approximate nozzle models to understand steady potential flow behavior in general physical nozzles using Riemannian geometry framework.

Method: Prove uniqueness on unit 2-sphere first, then extend to class of manifolds using maximum/comparison principle with special transonic shock solution as comparison function for elliptic-hyperbolic mixed-type PDE.

Result: Established uniqueness theorem: for given uniform supersonic upstream flow, exists unique uniform exit pressure enabling transonic shock solution, unique modulo translation.

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrated uniqueness of transonic shock solutions in approximate nozzle models, providing mathematical foundation for understanding shock behavior in general physical nozzles.

Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions with a transonic shock in a
two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a special metric, which can be
regarded as an approximate model of the general physical nozzles, within a
class of transonic shock solutions for steady potential flow. We first prove
the uniqueness of these solutions on the unit 2-sphere: for given uniform
supersonic upstream flow at the entry, there exists a unique uniform pressure
at the exit such that a transonic shock solution exists in the sphere, which is
unique modulo a translation. A similar result is then extended to a class of
manifolds. Mathematically, it is equivalent to showing a uniqueness theorem for
a free boundary problem of a second-order elliptic-hyperbolic mixed-type
partial differential equation in the general approximate nozzles. The proof is
based on the maximum/comparison principle with a suitable special transonic
shock solution as a comparison function.

*Jacob Bedrossian,Weiren Zhao,Ruizhao Zi*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies Vlasov-Poisson-Landau equations with small collision frequency, proving uniform Landau damping, enhanced dissipation, and collisionless limit convergence for Gevrey-class perturbations of Maxwellians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To justify that collisionless predictions match collisional plasma behavior in nonlinear equations and understand the interaction between Landau damping and collisions.

Method: Uses infinite-regularity commuting vector field method combined with Guo's weighted energy methods, hypocoercivity, novel treatment of collisionless Vlasov echoes, decomposition methods for collisional echoes, and quasi-linearization for slowly evolving modes.

Result: Proves uniform-in-collision-frequency Landau damping and enhanced dissipation, shows collisionless limit convergence, and generalizes previous results to broader perturbation classes.

Conclusion: First justification that collisionless predictions align with collisional plasma behavior in nonlinear equations, with novel mathematical techniques developed for handling collision-damping interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau Equations on
$\mathbb{T}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$ with small collision frequency $\nu\ll 1$. We
prove that for $\nu$-independent perturbations of the global Maxwellians in
Gevrey-$2_-$, solutions display uniform-in-$\nu$ Landau damping and enhanced
dissipation. Moreover, the collisionless limit holds, that is, as $\nu\to 0_+$
for $0<t\ll \nu^{-\frac{1}{3}}$, the $\nu > 0$ solutions converge uniformly
(and in much stronger norms) to the solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equation
with the same initial data. To our knowledge, this work is hence the first
justification that the collisionless prediction matches those of collisional
plasmas in the nonlinear equations.
  The interaction between Landau damping and collisions requires several new
ideas:
  (1) an infinite-regularity commuting vector field method, merged with Guo's
weighted energy methods for the Landau operator and hypocoercivity to extract
the enhanced dissipation;
  (2) A novel nearly-physical side treatment of the collisionless Vlasov
echoes;
  (3) A new set of decomposition methods to treat the effects of the nonlinear
collisions in the Volterra equation for the density (i.e., the ``collisional
echoes'')
  (4) A new quasi-linearization method for treating the effect of the slowly
evolving homogeneous modes over long times.
  As a side result, we also prove Landau damping and enhanced dissipation of
$O(\epsilon\nu^{1/3})$ Sobolev-space perturbations of homogeneous distributions
that are only $O(\epsilon)$ perturbations of global Maxwellians, generalizing
the recent results of Chaturvedi, Luk, and Nguyen. As another side result, our
methods also provide a nearly-completely physical-side proof of Mouhot and
Villani's theorem in the full range of Gevrey-$3_-$.

*Shifan Kang,Bingsong Long,Hairong Yuan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Mathematical proof that hypersonic flow fields around slender bodies depend only on parameter K (Mach number times slenderness) and adiabatic index, not on shape or Mach number independently, using Radon measure solutions of Euler equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous mathematical foundation for the hypersonic similarity law and understand how flow field structures simplify in the hypersonic limit around slender bodies.

Method: Used Radon measure solutions of steady compressible Euler equations, considered 2D flows past slender curved wedges and 3D flows past axisymmetric cones, developed new hypersonic small-disturbance equations, and performed convergence analysis as slenderness parameter τ→0.

Result: Showed that scaled flow field structures depend only on parameter K=M∞τ and adiabatic index γ, not on body shape or Mach number independently. Derived explicit Radon measure solutions that simplify convergence analysis.

Conclusion: The hypersonic similarity law is mathematically validated - hypersonic flows around slender bodies exhibit universal behavior characterized by parameter K and gas properties, enabling simplified analysis through hypersonic small-disturbance equations.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory on statement and validation
of the hypersonic similarity law within the framework of Radon measure
solutions of steady compressible Euler equations. We consider two scenarios:
(1) two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an
infinitely long slender curved wedge; (2) three-dimensional steady
non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long axisymmetric
cone.
  It turns out that, for the hypersonic flow passing through a slender body
with tiny slenderness $\tau$, if the parameter $K\doteq M_{\infty}\tau$ is
fixed, by taking $\tau \to 0$ (i.e., the Mach number of the upcoming flow
$M_{\infty} \to \infty$), the flow field structures (after scaling) no longer
depend on the body's shape and the Mach number $M_{\infty}$ independently, but
only on $K$ and adiabatic index $\gamma$ of the polytropic gas. Mathematically,
for non-isentropic Euler flows, we find a new system of hypersonic
small-disturbance equations to describe steady compressible hypersonic flows
passing slender bodies. We demonstrate that as $ \tau \to0$, under suitable
non-dimensional scalings, the Radon measure solutions of the original problems
of hypersonic flow passing bodies converge to those of corresponding hypersonic
small-disturbance problems. The explicit forms of the Radon measure solutions
derived for the two scenarios effectively simplify the convergence analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop mathematical tools for analyzing nonlinear hyperbolic traffic flow models and obtain exact solutions that can explain traffic dynamics, shock wave formation, and flow stability for practical traffic management applications.

Method: Used Lie symmetry analysis to determine infinitesimal generators and construct optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Applied method of nonlinear self-adjointness to establish conservation laws. Derived exact solutions including kink-type, peakon-type, and parabolic solitons. Investigated weak discontinuity C^1 wave dynamics.

Result: Successfully constructed various solitonic solutions (kink-type, peakon-type, parabolic solitons) and established conservation laws for the traffic flow model. Demonstrated nonlinear wave dynamics through weak discontinuity analysis and clarified shock wave development and flow stability.

Conclusion: The developed mathematical framework provides exact solutions and conservation laws that enhance understanding of traffic dynamics, with practical applications in traffic management, real-time control, and intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This work studies a macroscopic traffic flow model driven by a system of
nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Using Lie symmetry
analysis, we determine the infinitesimal generators and construct an optimal
system of one-dimensional subalgebras, facilitating symmetry reductions for the
governing system. In addition, we discussed the classical symmetry and solution
of the traffic flow model with the initial conditions left invariant. By
applying the method of nonlinear self-adjointness, conservation laws associated
with the model are established and are utilized to obtain exact solutions.
Using these exact solutions, we construct solitonic solutions, including
kink-type, peakon-type, and parabolic solitons. Additionally, using the weak
discontinuity $C^1$ wave illustrates nonlinear wave dynamics in traffic
evolution. Moreover, we investigate how these solutions affect traffic
behavior, clarifying shock wave development and flow stability. The results
provide a basis for useful applications in traffic management, real-time
traffic control, and intelligent transportation systems, as well as improving
mathematical knowledge of traffic dynamics.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of higher regularity and convergence for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with colored and white noise on 2D torus, establishing finite-dimensional random attractors in H^2 and H^3 spaces with convergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the regularity properties and convergence behavior of solutions to anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, particularly establishing finite-dimensional random attractors in higher Sobolev spaces.

Method: Used indirect approach by estimating H^2-distance between stochastic and deterministic solutions, established H^2 bounded absorbing sets, and proved (H,H^2)-smoothing effects to lift compactness from H to H^2 spaces.

Result: Proved existence of tempered (H,H^2)-random attractor with finite fractal dimension when f ∈ H, and (H,H^3)-random attractor when f ∈ H^2, with specific noise intensity conditions. Demonstrated upper semi-continuity and convergence as δ→0 in multiple function spaces.

Conclusion: The anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing possess finite-dimensional random attractors in higher regularity spaces, and solutions exhibit convergence properties with respect to noise parameter δ in various Sobolev space pairs.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the higher regularity and convergence of solutions
of anisotropic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive colored noise and
white noise on two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$. Under the conditions that
the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and the
noise intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty}
\leq \sqrt{\pi\delta} \frac{\nu \lambda_1}{2}$, it was proved that the random
anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor whose
(box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by
establishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an
$(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and
finite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force
$f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the
$H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of
estimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random anisotropic NS
equations and that of the corresponding deterministic anisotropic NS equations.
When the external force $f(\textbf{x})$ belongs to $H^2$ and the noise
intensity function $h(\textbf{x})$ satisfies the Assumption 2, it was proved
that the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^3)$-random
attractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^3$ is finite. Finally,
we prove the upper semi-continuity of random attractors and the convergence of
solutions of (8.3) as $\delta\rightarrow0$ in the spaces $(H,H)$, $(H,H^1)$,
$(H^1,H^2)$ and $(H^2,H^3)$, respectively.

*Simon N. Chandler-Wilde,Siavash Sadeghi*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows that for acoustic scattering by sound-soft obstacles without smoothness assumptions, the growth of the cut-off resolvent norm can be arbitrarily fast, unlike the exponential growth bound that holds for smooth boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how the lack of smoothness in obstacle boundaries affects the growth behavior of the cut-off resolvent norm in acoustic scattering problems, challenging the known exponential growth bound for smooth boundaries.

Method: The authors construct a compact obstacle Γ such that for any given increasing sequences of wavenumbers k_j and arbitrarily rapidly increasing values a_j, the norm of the cut-off resolvent at each k_j exceeds the corresponding a_j.

Result: The constructed non-smooth obstacle demonstrates that the cut-off resolvent norm can grow arbitrarily fast, without the exponential upper bound that applies to smooth boundaries.

Conclusion: Smoothness of the boundary is crucial for controlling resolvent growth in acoustic scattering problems, as its absence allows for arbitrarily fast growth of the cut-off resolvent norm.

Abstract: We consider time-harmonic acoustic scattering by a compact sound-soft
obstacle $\Gamma\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) that has connected complement
$\Omega := \mathbb{R}^n\setminus \Gamma$. This scattering problem is modelled
by the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation $\Delta u + k^2 u = -f$ in $\Omega$,
the boundary condition that $u=0$ on $\partial \Omega = \partial \Gamma$, and
the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition. It is well-known that, if the
boundary $\partial \Omega$ is smooth, then the norm of the cut-off resolvent of
the Laplacian, that maps the compactly supported inhomogeneous term $f$ to the
solution $u$ restricted to some ball, grows at worst exponentially with $k$. In
this paper we show that, if no smoothness of $\Gamma$ is imposed, then the
growth can be arbitrarily fast. Precisely, given some modestly increasing
unbounded sequence $0<k_1<k_2<\ldots$ and some arbitrarily rapidly increasing
sequence $0<a_1<a_2<\ldots$, we construct a compact $\Gamma$ such that, for
each $j\in \mathbb{N}$, the norm of the cut-off resolvent at $k=k_j$ is $>a_j$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed H^s solutions with mass below critical threshold are global, but dynamics at exactly critical mass were unknown

Method: Inspired by recent blow-up results for mass-critical gKdV equation, construct blow-up solutions at the mass threshold

Result: Demonstrates finite time blow-up singularity formation can occur at critical mass threshold for low regularity solutions

Conclusion: Complements previous nonexistence result in energy space H^1 by showing minimal mass blow-up is possible in lower regularity spaces

Abstract: In this article, we construct a minimal mass blow-up solution of the
two-dimensional cubic (mass-critical) Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation:
  \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t \phi+\partial_{x_1}(\Delta \phi+\phi^3)=0,\quad (t,x)\in
[0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^2.
  \end{equation*}
  Let $s>\frac{3}{4}$. Bhattacharya-Farah-Roudenko [2] show that $H^{s}$
solutions with $\|\phi\|_{L^{2}}<\|Q\|_{L^{2}}$ are global in time. For such
low regularity solutions, we study the dynamics at the threshold
$\|\phi\|_{L^{2}}=\|Q\|_{L^{2}}$ and demonstrate that finite time blow-up
singularity formation may occur. This result and its proof are inspired by the
recent blow-up result [29] for the mass-critical gKdV equation. This result is
also complement of previous result [6] for nonexistence of minimal mass blow-up
element in the energy space $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ of the two-dimensional
cubic Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation.

TL;DR: Analysis of boundary hemivariational inequalities for convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations modeling fluid flow through porous media, with existence and uniqueness proofs for both stationary and non-stationary cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model flow of viscous incompressible fluids through saturated porous media using nonlinear convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations with nonstandard boundary conditions involving Clarke subdifferential relations.

Method: For stationary case: surjectivity theorem for pseudomonotone operators. For non-stationary case: Rothe method (backward Euler temporal discretization) with limiting process as time step tends to zero.

Result: Established existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for both stationary and non-stationary cases. Solutions satisfy energy equality, are unique, and depend continuously on data. Results also applicable to 3D non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: Successfully developed mathematical framework for hemivariational inequality problems in porous media flow, with rigorous existence and uniqueness proofs that extend to broader fluid dynamics applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates boundary hemivariational inequality problems
associated with both stationary and non-stationary two and three-dimensional
convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations (or Navier-stokes equations with
damping), which model the flow of viscous incompressible fluids through
saturated porous media. The governing equations are nonlinear in both velocity
and pressure and are subject to nonstandard boundary conditions. Specifically,
we impose the no-slip condition along with a Clarke subdifferential relation
between pressure and the normal velocity components. For the stationary case,
we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using a
surjectivity theorem for pseudomonotone operators. The existence of weak
solutions to the non-stationary hemivariational inequality is established via a
limiting process applied to a temporally semi-discrete scheme, where the time
derivative is approximated using the backward Euler method-commonly referred to
as the Rothe method. It is demonstrated that the discrete problem admits
solutions, which possess a weakly convergent subsequence as the time step tends
to zero, and that any such weak limit satisfies the original hemivariational
inequality. A novel outcome of this paper is that the existence results
obtained in this work is applicable to 3D non-stationary Navier-Stokes
equations also. Moreover, under appropriate conditions on the absorption
exponent, we show that Leray-Hopf weak solutions satisfies the energy equality,
the solution is shown to be unique and to depend continuously on the given
data.

Motivation: Simplify regularity analysis for general inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equations by reducing to cases without sign-changing inhomogeneous terms and vanishing gradient singularities.

Method: Prove superposition principle for general viscosity solutions using cone comparison techniques in metric spaces, and study generalization for elliptic and convex equations.

Result: Established that the sum of viscosity solutions in disjoint domains is a viscosity solution in the product domain for the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation.

Conclusion: The superposition principle provides a powerful tool for simplifying regularity analysis and extends to metric spaces and general elliptic/convex equations.

Abstract: We establish a superposition principle in disjoint variables for the
inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation. We show that the sum of viscosity
solutions of the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation in separate domains is
a viscosity solution in the product domain. This result has been used in the
literature with certain particular choices of solutions to simplify regularity
analysis for a general inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation by reducing it
to the case without sign-changing inhomogeneous terms and vanishing gradient
singularities. We present a proof of this superposition principle for general
viscosity solutions. We also explore generalization in metric spaces using cone
comparison techniques and study related properties for general elliptic and
convex equations.

Motivation: To investigate the limitations of Chapman-Enskog theory and identify non-hydrodynamic solutions in kinetic systems that deviate from traditional hydrodynamic scaling assumptions.

Method: Analysis of the one-dimensional three-component Grad system, examining solutions that violate the Chapman-Enskog scaling in Knudsen number and identifying fast spectral manifolds in kinetic phase space.

Result: Found solutions that do not converge to Euler or Navier-Stokes equations as Knudsen number vanishes, corresponding to fast spectral manifolds that represent non-hydrodynamic behavior.

### [35] [Green functions, Hitchin's formula and curvature equations on tori](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17604)
*Zhijie Chen,Erjuan Fu,Chang-Shou Lin*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies critical points of Green functions on tori. It proves non-degeneracy of 5 critical points in the standard case, and classifies possible numbers (4,6,8,10) for symmetrized Green functions G_p, with applications to curvature equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and distribution of critical points of Green functions on tori, particularly for symmetrized versions, and to explore how torus geometry affects solution structures of curvature equations.

Method: Uses Hitchin's formula to prove generic non-degeneracy of critical points, applies anti-holomorphic dynamics techniques, and studies the distribution as parameter p varies.

Result: Proves that 5 critical points are non-degenerate, shows G_p has exactly 4,6,8, or 10 critical points depending on (τ,p), and demonstrates all numbers occur. Studies distribution of critical point counts.

Conclusion: The geometry of the torus significantly influences the solution structure of curvature equations, with critical point counts varying systematically with parameter choices, providing insights into the relationship between geometric properties and analytic solutions.

Abstract: Let $G(z)=G(z;\tau)$ be the Green function on the torus
$E_{\tau}=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau)$ with the singularity at $0$.
Lin and Wang (Ann. Math. 2010) proved that $G(z)$ has either $3$ or $5$
critical points (depending on the choice of $\tau$). Later, Bergweiler and
Eremenko (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016) gave a new proof of this remarkable
result by using anti-holomorphic dynamics.
  In this paper, firstly, we prove that once $G(z)$ has $5$ critical points,
then these $5$ critical points are all non-degenerate. Secondly, we prove that
for any $p\in E_{\tau}$ satisfying $p\neq -p$ in $E_{\tau}$, the number of
critical points of $G_p(z):=\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$ belongs to $\{4,6,8,10\}$
(depending on the choice of $(\tau, p)$) and each number really occurs. We
apply Hitchin's formula to prove the generic non-degeneracy of critical points.
This allows us to study the distribution of the numbers of critical points of
$G_p$ as $p$ varies. Applications to the curvature equation $\Delta
u+e^{u}=4\pi(\delta_{p}+\delta_{-p})$ on $E_{\tau}$ are also given. How the
geometry of the torus affects the solution structure is studied.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the regularity properties of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions and the solvability of Schr\"odinger equations in high-dimensional settings, particularly in spectral Barron spaces where neural networks can achieve dimension-free approximation.

Method: The authors use assumptions that the potential V consists of one-particle and pairwise interaction parts in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, and prove regularity results for eigenfunctions. They establish solvability under the same or stronger assumptions that V belongs to the spectral Barron space.

Result: All eigenfunctions belong to specific Barron spaces with regularity depending on parameters. The paper shows solvability of Schr\"odinger equations and derives compactness results for potentials in Barron spaces with s > -1, accommodating many singular potentials like inverse power potentials.

Conclusion: The work provides rigorous mathematical foundations for analyzing Schr\"odinger equations in high dimensions using spectral Barron spaces, demonstrating that neural networks can achieve dimension-free approximation in these settings under appropriate regularity conditions.

Abstract: This work investigates the regularity of Schr\"odinger eigenfunctions and the
solvability of Schr\"odinger equations in spectral Barron space

and an additional part $V_{\operatorname{a d}} \in

$\psi\in \bigcap_{\gamma<s+2-n/\alpha} \mathcal{B}^{\gamma}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$
and $\psi\in \mathcal{B}^{s+2}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$ if $\alpha=\infty$, where
$1/\alpha+1/\alpha^{\prime}=1$ and $2+s-|s|-n/\alpha>0$. The assumption
accommodates many prevalent singular potentials, such as inverse power
potentials. Moreover, under the same assumption or a stronger assumption
$V\in\mathcal{B}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$, we establish the solvability of
Schr\"odinger equations and derive compactness results for
$V\in\mathcal{B}^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{nN})$ with $s>-1$.

TL;DR: Short-time well-posedness analysis of a diffuse interface model coupling Biot's poroelasticity with Cahn-Hilliard equation for two-phase deformable porous media flow, with and without visco-elastic Kelvin-Voigt terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish mathematical foundations for modeling fluid flow through deformable porous media with phase transitions, where material properties depend on phase-field variables and the system exhibits complex nonlinear coupling.

Method: Reduced both problems to fixed-point equations solved using maximal regularity theory and contraction arguments. Used semigroup approach over Hilbert spaces for the case without visco-elastic terms, and applied Banach scales for the case with Kelvin-Voigt terms under minimal spatial regularity assumptions.

Result: Proved short-time well-posedness for both variants of the diffuse interface model - with and without visco-elastic Kelvin-Voigt terms.

Conclusion: The mathematical framework successfully establishes well-posedness for complex coupled poroelastic-phase-field systems, providing rigorous foundation for modeling two-phase deformable porous media with different mechanical response characteristics.

Abstract: We show short-time well-posedness of a diffuse interface model describing the
flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases.
The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including
phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to
model the evolution of the solid, where we further distinguish between the
absence and presence of a visco-elastic term of Kelvin-Voigt type. While both
problems will be reduced to a fixed-point equation that can be solved using
maximal regularity theory along with a contraction argument, the first case
relies on a semigroup approach over suitable Hilbert spaces, whereas treating
the second case under minimal assumptions with respect to spatial regularity
necessitates the application of Banach scales.

Motivation: To establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the inequality between Bourgain space X^{s,b} norm and mixed Lebesgue space L_t^qL_x^r norm, which is crucial for solving low regularity well-posedness of Korteweg-de Vries equations and stochastic KdV equations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of heat equation extrema on warped product manifolds and verify Rauch's hot spots conjecture in these geometric settings, particularly focusing on warped products and infinite cones over closed Riemannian manifolds.

Method: Mathematical analysis of heat equation solutions on warped product manifolds of the form ([0,L]×M, dr²+f(r)²h), applying spectral theory and geometric methods to study extrema behavior under specific conditions on the warping function f.

Result: Proved that under certain conditions on the warping function, Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds for warped product manifolds. For infinite cones over closed manifolds, identified four distinct long-time behaviors of hot spots depending solely on the spectral gap of the fiber manifold.

Conclusion: The study provides rigorous mathematical validation of Rauch's conjecture for specific warped product geometries and establishes a complete classification of long-term hot spot behavior on infinite cones, with outcomes determined by the spectral properties of the underlying manifold.

Abstract: We study extrema of solutions to the heat equation (i.e. hot spots) on
certain types of warped product manifolds of the form $([0,L]\times
M,dr^2+f(r)^2h)$ where $(M,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. We prove that,
under certain conditions on the warping function $f$, the statement of Rauch's
hot spots conjecture holds for the corresponding warped product. We then go on
to study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed
Riemannian manifolds. In this case, under appropriate hypotheses on the initial

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: New regularized interface method for proving existence of weak solutions to nonlinear moving boundary problems with low-regularity interfaces in fluid-poroelastic structure interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existence theory available for nonlinear moving-domain FPSI problems due to lack of interface regularity preventing weak solution formulation.

Method: Regularize Biot displacement via spatial convolution, modify weak formulation for energy consistency, use thin plate insertion, time-discretization, and compactness arguments.

Result: Proved existence of weak solutions to regularized interface problem for each fixed regularization parameter δ > 0.

Conclusion: The regularization is essential for maintaining geometric control of moving interface and accommodating vector-valued structural displacements.

Abstract: We introduce a new regularized interface method for proving existence of weak
solutions to nonlinear moving boundary problems with low-regularity interfaces.
We study a fluid-poroelastic structure interaction (FPSI) problem coupling the
Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid with the Biot
system for a bulk poroelastic medium. The two phases occupy domains of the same
spatial dimension, separated by a moving interface defined by the trace of the
poroelastic displacement, which exhibits low regularity and strong geometric
nonlinearities. Despite its importance in applications, no existence theory has
been available for this nonlinear moving-domain setting, primarily because the
lack of interface regularity precludes even the formulation of a weak solution
framework.
  To address this gap, we (1) introduce a regularization of the Biot
displacement via spatial convolution at scale $\delta > 0$, which defines
regularized moving domains and interface, and (2) modify the weak formulation
in a way that preserves energy consistency with the original problem. For each
fixed $\delta > 0$, we prove existence of a weak solution to the resulting
regularized interface problem. The proof strategy involves inserting a thin
plate of thickness $h > 0$ at the interface, applying a time-discretization via
a Lie operator splitting scheme, establishing uniform a priori bounds, and
employing Aubin-Lions compactness on moving domains. The analysis is
particularly involved, partly because the thin plate allows displacements in
all spatial directions. Passing to the limit $h \to 0$ with uniform-in-h
estimates and compactness arguments yields a regularized interface weak
solution. The regularization introduced in this manuscript is essential to
maintain uniform geometric control of the moving interface and to accommodate
vector-valued structural displacements.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: FDTRImageEnhancer is a physics-informed deep learning framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from FDTR phase data by combining Gaussian convolution modeling with microstructure-aware neural networks to detect grain boundary thermal conductivity drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FDTR inversions often visually obscure grain boundary thermal conductivity drops due to spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, limiting accurate thermal transport characterization in microstructured materials.

Method: Integrates physics-based Gaussian convolution to model beam averaging effects, uses k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images to reduce parameter space, and employs a physics-informed neural network that jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps.

Result: The framework recovers bulk thermal conductivity values with less than 0.5% error on synthetic data and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution, successfully detecting thermal conductivity drops at grain boundaries.

Conclusion: FDTRImageEnhancer provides an effective open-source solution for improved thermal conductivity mapping that can detect subtle grain boundary effects, with methodology adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.

Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that
improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance
(FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution
abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models
the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering
of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse
modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error
and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the
detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in
conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated
synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error
and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image
resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility,
with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport

inspection was done in order to evaluate the conditions under the water. The
next step was to make a diagnostics survey, based on the drilling, endoscopic
tests and water pressure tests. Based on the results, several detailed
numerical models were created in order to analyse the pier behaviour and
conduct a parametric study to investigate various factors, leading to the
defects. The numerical models covered the complex geometry of the pier,
consisting of the inner poor concrete core and outer shell from sandstone
masonry blocks. The above-described procedure revealed the causes of the
defects and also recommended the proper strengthening of the pier.

### [48] [Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17903)
*Milton Gomez,Louis Poulain--Auzeau,Alexis Berne,Tom Beucler*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A lightweight post-processing framework improves tropical cyclone intensity forecasts from Neural Weather Models by using observational wind gust and pressure data, achieving accurate 5-day forecasts without requiring storm tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Weather Models trained on low-resolution reanalyses smooth out key weather features like tropical cyclone intensity. Current deterministic forecasts at 0.25° resolution fail to capture critical extremes like wind gusts that are essential for accurate TC intensity forecasting.

Method: Used observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on Neural Weather Model outputs (Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2). The tracking-independent approach employs both linear models and more complex architectures, testing spatial masking and comparing convolutional networks with multilayer perceptrons.

Result: The post-processing models produced accurate and reliable TC intensity forecasts up to five days ahead. Linear models successfully extracted predictive information beyond initial conditions. Spatial masking improved probabilistic forecast consistency, but convolutional architectures showed no clear advantage over simple multilayer perceptrons.

Conclusion: Combining efficient Neural Weather Models with lightweight, tracking-independent post-processing improves global TC intensity forecast accessibility and represents progress toward democratizing these critical weather predictions.

Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical
equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric
processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning,
Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP
emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP
models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial
resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key
features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the
most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human
activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as
proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg}
resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind
gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing
models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the
post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity
up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent,
preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract
predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their
initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast
consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures
over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes.
Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight,
tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the
accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their
democratization.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Extending Stochastic Backscatter Model from structured to unstructured CFD solvers by deriving analytical spatial correlations from implicit Laplace smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original method only works for structured solvers due to its sequential smoothing approach. Need to make it compatible with unstructured solvers using Laplace smoothing.

Method: Employ implicit Laplace smoothing instead of sequential coordinate smoothing to generate correlated random variables for unstructured computational domains.

Result: Derived analytical expressions for the spatial correlation resulting from implicit Laplace smoothing approach.

Conclusion: Successfully extended the Stochastic Backscatter Model to unstructured CFD solvers by analytically characterizing the spatial correlations from Laplace smoothing.

Abstract: The Stochastic Backscatter Model involves the generation of a set of random
variables characterised by prescribed correlations in space and time. These
variables are obtained by smoothing an initially uncorrelated random field,
which produces an exponentially decaying spatial correlation. The smoothing is
applied implicitly and sequentially along the three coordinate directions of
the computational domain, making the approach suitable only for structured CFD
solvers. To extend the method to unstructured solvers, implicit Laplace
smoothing can be employed instead. However, the spatial correlation resulting
from this alternative approach must be derived analytically. This constitutes
the main objective of the present dissertation.

TL;DR: Meshless generalization of FDTD using radial basis functions requires hyperviscosity stabilization but offers reduced dispersion anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the popular finite difference time domain (FDTD) method to a meshless setting using local radial basis function interpolation for computational electromagnetics.

Method: Developed two meshless FDTD variants using local radial basis function interpolation, identified instability issues, and stabilized them by adding properly chosen hyperviscosity terms to the update equations.

Result: The proposed meshless methods are convergent and demonstrate decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to traditional FDTD method.

Conclusion: Meshless FDTD methods with radial basis functions and hyperviscosity stabilization are viable alternatives that can reduce dispersion anisotropy while maintaining convergence properties.

Abstract: The finite difference time domain method is one of the most popular methods
in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of
generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function
interpolation. The resulting methods turn out to be unstable, but can be
stabilised by adding properly chosen hyperviscosity terms to the update
equations. We demonstrate that the proposed meshless methods are convergent and
can enjoy a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference

TL;DR: Improved nonlocal multigroup model for magnetized plasmas with revised diffusion source term, Biermann-producing electric field equation, and nonlocal Nernst velocity correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multigroup models for plasmas under inertial confinement fusion lack accuracy and methodology for implementing nonlocal magnetic field corrections, particularly for describing kinetic behaviors driven by intense temperature gradients.

Method: Developed an improved nonlocal multigroup model with three key advancements: revised source term in diffusion equations, Biermann-producing electric field equation with density perturbation, and nonlocal correction method for Nernst velocity.

Result: The model accurately predicts key phenomena arising from nonlocal effects in magnetized plasmas across three test cases, with numerical analysis of anisotropic heat conduction equation.

Conclusion: The developed model provides an accurate framework for describing kinetic behaviors and nonlocal effects in magnetized plasmas under inertial confinement fusion conditions, addressing limitations of existing multigroup approaches.

Abstract: Distortions in the electron distribution function driven by intense
temperature gradients critically influence the generation and evolution of heat
flux and magnetic fields in plasmas under the condition of inertial confinement
fusion. Describing such kinetic behaviors at large spatiotemporal scales
typically requires multigroup models based on simplified Vlasov-Fokker-Planck
equations. However, the accuracy of existing multigroup models remains
uncertain, without a well-defined methodology for implementing nonlocal
magnetic field corrections. This paper develops an improved nonlocal multigroup
model for magnetized plasmas. The advancements comprise: (i) a revised source
term in the diffusion equations, (ii) a Biermann-producing electric field
equation incorporating the density perturbation, and (iii) a nonlocal
correction method for the Nernst velocity. The numerical method for the
anisotropic heat conduction equation is analyzed, and three test cases
demonstrate that the model accurately predicts the key phenomena arising from
nonlocal effects in magnetized plasmas.

TL;DR: Two-color mixed-frequency laser pulses generate significantly enhanced THz radiation at plasma interfaces compared to single-frequency pulses, with phase-controllable output that can be orders of magnitude stronger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional single-frequency bipolar laser pulses for THz generation by exploring two-color mixed-frequency pulses that can enhance THz performance through controlled amplitude and phase tuning.

Method: Derived a new expression for ponderomotive force that captures phase asymmetry effects in mixed-frequency pulses, analyzed oblique incidence of s-polarized Gaussian laser pulses on semi-infinite underdense plasma, and compared performance with single-frequency pulses.

Result: Mixed-frequency pulses with same total energy as single-frequency pulses generate significantly enhanced ponderomotive force, leading to THz yields several orders of magnitude higher, with tunable strength and broadening through phase control.

Conclusion: Two-color mixed-frequency pulse configuration emerges as a highly efficient, phase-controllable driver for THz radiation, offering a promising route for optimizing THz source design via tailored laser-plasma interactions.

Abstract: We investigate terahertz (THz) radiation generation at the vacuum-plasma
interface driven by the oblique incidence of s-polarized Gaussian laser
pulse(s) on a semi-infinite underdense plasma.~Extending beyond the
conventional single-frequency bipolar pulse (B-pulse), this work focuses on
leveraging two-color mixed-frequency pulse-- (M-pulse) excitation to enhance
THz performance in terms of strength and broadening that can be tuned through
controlled amplitude and phase of the constituent pulses of the M-pulse. A new
expression for the ponderomotive force (PF) -- which acts as the main driver of
THz radiation at the vacuum-plasma boundary -- is derived to capture the
hitherto unexplored effects of phase asymmetry intrinsic to the M-pulse, in
contrast to a single B-pulse where its phase is irrelevant. This PF formulation
captures the underlying cycle-to-cycle symmetry-breaking for the M-pulse field,
responsible for efficient THz emission. We demonstrate analytically that such
M-pulses of the same total energy as a B-pulse may generate significantly
enhanced PF, leading to THz yields several orders of magnitude higher. With a
judicious choice of low-frequency to high-frequency ratio, the M-pulse
configuration is shown to emerge as a highly efficient, phase-controllable
driver of
  THz radiation and offers a promising route for optimizing THz source design
via tailored two-color laser-plasma interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate alignment between plasma sources and electron beams is critical for plasma wakefield accelerator performance and efficiency, particularly for collider design studies and light source applications.

Method: Analyze plasma afterglow light at two longitudinal locations while scanning plasma column across electron beam, using relative light intensity to determine alignment. Verification through drive beam energy loss, energy transfer efficiency, and witness beam energy gain measurements.

Result: Successfully aligned 85-cm plasma source to 10 GeV, 1.6 nC electron beam with 10 um offset and 10 urad tilt precision. Extracted alignment tolerance requirements for laser-ionized plasma sources.

Conclusion: The method provides precise alignment capability essential for advanced plasma wakefield accelerator applications, establishing important alignment tolerance metrics for future collider and light source designs.

Abstract: We present a novel method for aligning a laser ionized plasma source to a
pair of ultra-relativistic electron beams that comprise a plasma wakefield
accelerator (PWFA). We achieve alignment by analyzing the plasma afterglow
light observed at two longitudinal locations as the plasma column is scanned
across the electron beam. By analyzing the relative plasma light intensity at
the two locations, we aligned an 85-cm plasma source to a 10 GeV, 1.6 nC
electron beam to within 10 um offset, 10 urad tilt. The alignment is verified
by analyzing the drive beam energy loss, energy transfer efficiency, and the
witness beam energy gain as a function of the misalignment between the beams
and the plasma. From this measurement, we extract the alignment tolerance
required between the laser-ionized plasma source and electron beams, an
important metric necessary for collider design studies or light source
applications based on a laser-ionized plasma source.

TL;DR: Mesoporous β-FeSe films grown by pulsed laser deposition in argon atmosphere form porous epitaxial structures through oriented-attachment of pre-formed clusters rather than conventional atomic epitaxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the growth mechanisms of mesoporous metal chalcogenide films and explore how pulsed laser deposition in inert gas background can create porous electrocatalyst materials with specific crystal orientations.

Method: Used KrF pulsed laser deposition in argon atmosphere (100 mTorr) with gated intensified CCD imaging and ion probe measurements to analyze plasma plume dynamics. Characterized films using X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.

Result: Films formed porous framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes <100 nm. Epitaxial growth occurred via oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters rather than atomic constituents. Films showed specific in-plane orientation (β-FeSe[100]∥[110]MgO) due to alignment with MgO surface corrugations.

Conclusion: PLD in inert gas background enables growth of mesoporous electrocatalyst materials with single crystallographic orientation, allowing exposure of specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions and active site engineering.

Abstract: Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO
substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100
mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe
measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth
initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume
interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex
dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding
between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume
interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\le$0.5
eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films
grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\circ$C, a
laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous
framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction
indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate
and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very
small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films
from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was
$\beta$-FeSe[100]$\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of
pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of
$\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies
that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas
background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic
orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions
and active site engineering.

TL;DR: Novel design principle using "heavy-light and soft-stiff" structural motif to achieve ultralow thermal conductivity by suppressing both particle-like and wave-like phonon transport channels simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the conventional trade-off between particle-like (κₚ) and wave-like (κ_c) phonon transport channels in thermal conductivity reduction, enabling concurrent suppression of both transport mechanisms.

Method: Combines heavy and light atomic species with soft and stiff bonding networks. Uses first-principles calculations to analyze hierarchical phonon spectrum, high-throughput screening to identify candidate materials (Tl₄SiS₄ and Tl₄GeS₄), and develops a 1D triatomic chain model to demonstrate the mechanism.

Result: Achieved ultralow thermal conductivity with Tl₄SiS₄ (κₚ = 0.10, κ_c = 0.06 W/mK) and Tl₄GeS₄ (κₚ = 0.09, κ_c = 0.06 W/mK), showing strong suppression in both transport channels. Soft-bonded heavy atoms create dense low-frequency modes that enhance scattering, while stiff-bonded light atoms produce sparse high-frequency optical branches that disrupt coherence.

Conclusion: The "heavy-light and soft-stiff" architecture offers a new paradigm for phonon engineering that breaks the conventional κₚ-κ_c trade-off, providing a generalizable design principle for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in crystalline materials.

Abstract: We propose a novel design principle for achieving ultralow thermal
conductivity in crystalline materials via a "heavy-light and soft-stiff"
structural motif. By combining heavy and light atomic species with soft and
stiff bonding networks, both particle-like ($\kappa_p$) and wave-like
($\kappa_c$) phonon transport channels are concurrently suppressed.
First-principles calculations show that this architecture induces a
hierarchical phonon spectrum: soft-bonded heavy atoms generate dense
low-frequency modes that enhance scattering and reduce $\kappa_p$, while
stiff-bonded light atoms produce sparse high-frequency optical branches that
disrupt coherence and lower $\kappa_c$. High-throughput screening identifies
Tl$_4$SiS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.10, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) and Tl$_4$GeS$_4$
($\kappa_p$ = 0.09, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) as representative candidates with
strongly suppressed transport in both channels. A minimal 1D triatomic chain
model further demonstrates the generality of this mechanism, offering a new
paradigm for phonon engineering beyond the conventional $\kappa_p$-$\kappa_c$
trade-off.

Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can
enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss

TL;DR: Study of ReLU neural networks on sphere S² shows Frequency Principle (low-frequency-first learning) tendency but not absolute rule, with trainable weights increasing complexity and enabling high-frequency emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks learn on curved domains like the unit sphere, specifically examining the Frequency Principle dynamics with both fixed and trainable neuron directions.

Method: Spherical harmonic expansions analysis of shallow ReLU networks on S² in polar coordinates, comparing fixed vs trainable weight directions through mathematical analysis and numerical experiments.

Result: Fixed weights show intrinsic low-frequency preference with O(ℓ^{5/2}/2^ℓ) decay, trainable weights show O(ℓ^{7/2}/2^ℓ) decay. FP can be violated under specific conditions. Trainable directions increase complexity and can enable faster high-frequency learning.

Conclusion: Frequency Principle should be viewed as a tendency rather than a strict rule on curved domains like S², with direction updates and harmonic expansions significantly shaping frequency-dependent learning dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the learning dynamics of shallow ReLU neural networks on the
unit sphere \(S^2\subset\mathbb{R}^3\) in polar coordinates \((\tau,\phi)\),
considering both fixed and trainable neuron directions \(\{w_i\}\). For fixed
weights, spherical harmonic expansions reveal an intrinsic low-frequency
preference with coefficients decaying as \(O(\ell^{5/2}/2^\ell)\), typically
leading to the Frequency Principle (FP) of lower-frequency-first learning.
However, this principle can be violated under specific initial conditions or
error distributions. With trainable weights, an additional rotation term in the
harmonic evolution equations preserves exponential decay with decay order
\(O(\ell^{7/2}/2^\ell)\) factor, also leading to the FP of
lower-frequency-first learning. But like fixed weights case, the principle can
be violated under specific initial conditions or error distributions. Our
numerical results demonstrate that trainable directions increase learning
complexity and can either maintain a low-frequency advantage or enable faster
high-frequency emergence. This analysis suggests the FP should be viewed as a
tendency rather than a rule on curved domains like \(S^2\), providing insights
into how direction updates and harmonic expansions shape frequency-dependent
learning.

Motivation: To understand the quantization rule for parameter values where flat bands occur in periodic scalar operators, as observed in recent physics literature.

Method: Presents a general theorem on solution structure, uses heuristic WKB arguments, conducts numerical experiments, and analyzes a simplified model with complex WKB methods.

Result: The WKB structure explains the quantization condition, and both the structure and rule are confirmed by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical and numerical validation of quantization rules for flat band parameters in periodic scalar operators through WKB analysis.

Abstract: We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define
flat bands in the sense of Floquet--Bloch theory. One puzzling question
originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values
of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem
about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic
argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also
explains the quantisation condition -- both the WKB structure and that rule are
confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in
which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.

Motivation: Urban wind flow prediction is essential for planning and safety but challenging due to uncertain boundary conditions and high computational costs of traditional CFD simulations.

Method: Lattice Boltzmann method coupled with stochastic collocation based on generalized polynomial chaos, using sparse-grid quadrature and a relative-error noise model for inflow wind speeds.

Result: The framework efficiently computes mean flow fields, standard deviations, and confidence intervals, showing uncertainty localization in complex flow regions like wakes and shear layers.

Conclusion: SC LBM approach provides accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ practical for real-time urban wind analysis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of urban wind flow is essential for urban planning,
pedestrian safety, and environmental management. Yet, it remains challenging
due to uncertain boundary conditions and the high cost of conventional CFD
simulations. This paper presents the use of the modular and efficient
uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework OpenLB-UQ for urban wind flow
simulations. We specifically use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled
with a stochastic collocation (SC) approach based on generalized polynomial
chaos (gPC). The framework introduces a relative-error noise model for inflow
wind speeds based on real measurements. The model is propagated through a
non-intrusive SC LBM pipeline using sparse-grid quadrature. Key quantities of
interest, including mean flow fields, standard deviations, and vertical
profiles with confidence intervals, are efficiently computed without altering
the underlying deterministic solver. We demonstrate this on a real urban
scenario, highlighting how uncertainty localizes in complex flow regions such
as wakes and shear layers. The results show that the SC LBM approach provides
accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational
efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ a practical tool for real-time urban wind

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper investigates the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem for fluid mechanics using Log-Lattices, showing it holds for reversible Navier-Stokes equations and can extend to irreversible ones under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid dynamics are inherently irreversible, violating a key assumption of fluctuation theorems. The research aims to address this fundamental conflict by examining whether GCFT can apply to fluid systems despite their irreversibility.

Method: Uses the concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices and analyzes the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation model that restores time-reversal symmetry while maintaining core Navier-Stokes characteristics.

Result: Demonstrates that GCFT holds for the RNS system on Log-Lattices and shows this result can be extended to traditional irreversible Navier-Stokes equations under certain assumptions. Also finds phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation.

Conclusion: The Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem can be validated for fluid mechanical systems through appropriate mathematical frameworks, bridging the gap between irreversible fluid dynamics and fluctuation theorem requirements.

Abstract: Using the recent concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices, we
investigate the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (GCFT) in
the context of fluid mechanics. The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently
irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation
theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the
Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal
symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core
characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the
GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be
extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible
Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction
rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated.

*Behzad Azmi,Michael Kartmann,Stefan Volkwein*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Stabilization of linear time-varying parabolic PDEs using reduced-order model based receding horizon controls with proven exponential stability and performance bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop computationally efficient control strategies for complex PDE systems by leveraging reduced-order models while maintaining stability guarantees and performance bounds.

Method: Combines continuous-time full-order model receding horizon control with Galerkin model reduction, rigorous a posteriori error analysis, and adaptive construction of reduced-order controls.

Result: Proves exponential stability and suboptimality of the control scheme, provides computable performance bounds, and demonstrates effectiveness through numerical experiments with non-smooth cost functionals on unstable systems.

Conclusion: ROM-based receding horizon control successfully stabilizes parabolic PDEs with rigorous theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness, even for challenging unstable systems.

Abstract: We address the stabilization of linear, time-varying parabolic PDEs using
finite-dimensional receding horizon controls (RHCs) derived from reduced-order
models (ROMs). We first prove exponential stability and suboptimality of the
continuous-time full-order model (FOM) RHC scheme in Hilbert spaces. A Galerkin
model reduction is then introduced, along with a rigorous a posteriori error
analysis for the associated finite-horizon optimal control problems. This
results in a ROM-based RHC algorithm that adaptively constructs reduced-order
controls, ensuring exponential stability of the FOM closed-loop state and
providing computable performance bounds with respect to the infinite-horizon
FOM control problem. Numerical experiments with a non-smooth cost functional
involving the squared l1-norm confirm the methods effectiveness, even for
exponentially unstable systems.

*Xun Tang,Michael Shavlovsky,Holakou Rahmanian,Tesi Xiao,Lexing Ying*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Novel Sinkhorn-type algorithms with sparse Newton iterations for entropic optimal transport under martingale constraints, achieving super-exponential convergence with controllable constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges in martingale optimal transport problems by leveraging recent success of Sinkhorn algorithms and handling structural constraints equivalent to row-wise matrix constraints.

Method: Propose entropic formulation for MOT problem, develop Sinkhorn-type algorithms with sparse Newton iterations that exploit approximate sparsity of Hessian matrix in dual objective, and use entropic regularization for approximate constraint satisfaction.

Result: Algorithms demonstrate super-exponential convergence in practice and maintain robustness with controllable thresholds for total constraint violations.

Conclusion: The proposed computational methods effectively solve entropic optimal transport problems under martingale constraints with excellent convergence properties and practical feasibility through entropic regularization.

Abstract: This work introduces novel computational methods for entropic optimal
transport (OT) problems under martingale-type conditions. The considered
problems include the discrete martingale optimal transport (MOT) problem.
Moreover, as the (super-)martingale conditions are equivalent to row-wise
(in-)equality constraints on the coupling matrix, our work applies to a
prevalent class of OT problems with structural constraints. Inspired by the
recent empirical success of Sinkhorn-type algorithms, we propose an entropic
formulation for the MOT problem and introduce Sinkhorn-type algorithms with
sparse Newton iterations that utilize the (approximate) sparsity of the Hessian
matrix of the dual objective. As exact martingale conditions are typically
infeasible, we adopt entropic regularization to find an approximate
constraint-satisfied solution. We show that, in practice, the proposed
algorithms enjoy both super-exponential convergence and robustness with
controllable thresholds for total constraint violations.

TL;DR: Sharp O(ε) convergence rates for homogenization of first-order ODEs in various settings including single-scale, multi-scale, quasi-periodic, and weakly coupled systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide quantitative homogenization results for first-order ODEs with improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared to existing literature.

Method: Mathematical analysis of homogenization for scalar ODEs (single and multi-scale), extension to higher dimensions with bounded trajectories, and study of weakly coupled systems with fast switching rates.

Result: Achieved sharp O(ε) convergence rate for single-scale scalar ODEs, improved short-time error to O(ε) in multi-scale setting matching long-time results, established quasi-periodic homogenization framework, and obtained first-time O(ε) rate for weakly coupled systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive quantitative homogenization results for first-order ODEs with sharp convergence rates, extending to various settings with applications to transport equations and connections to PDEs and gradient systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the quantitative homogenization of first-order ODEs.
For single-scale scalar ODEs, we obtain a sharp $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence
rate and characterize the effective constant. In the multi-scale setting, our
results match those of \cite{IM} for long times but improve the short-time
error to $O(\varepsilon)$. We also initiate the study of quasi-periodic
homogenization in this context. The scalar framework is further extended to
higher dimensions under a boundedness assumption on trajectories. For weakly
coupled systems with fast switching rates, we obtain for the first time a
convergence rate of order $O(\varepsilon)$. These results have applications to
linear transport equations and broader connections to PDEs and gradient
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calderón and Zygmund's 1956 work established L^p-boundedness for 1<p<∞ but left the p=1 endpoint case as an open problem.

Method: Mathematical analysis of maximal truncated rough singular integral operators using harmonic analysis techniques.

Result: Proves that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type (1,1).

Conclusion: Completes the boundedness theory for these operators by solving the long-standing endpoint case p=1.

Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and
Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and
established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 < p < \infty$. However, the endpoint
case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More
precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator
is of weak type $(1,1)$.

TL;DR: A framework for generating protein structures with desired flexibility profiles using equivariant neural networks and conditional flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein generation methods are limited to static properties, but flexibility is crucial for functions like catalysis and molecular recognition.

Method: Developed BackFlip (equivariant NN for predicting flexibility) and FliPS (SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model for generating backbones with target flexibility).

Result: Successfully generated novel and diverse protein backbones with desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: The framework enables conditional protein structure generation based on flexibility, overcoming limitations of static property-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have
enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties.
However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to
generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and
symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which
is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.
We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting
per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,
we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that
solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target
flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate
novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for solving advection-diffusion equations using Schrodingerisation technique, validated on IBM quantum hardware with 16 qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hamiltonian simulation remains underexplored for PDE solving, particularly for long-term fault-tolerant quantum computing applications in complex transport problems.

Method: Combines upwinding discretization for advection and central differencing for diffusion, adapted for quantum implementation using approximation and optimization techniques with Schrodingerisation approach.

Result: Effective performance demonstrated on 2D/3D benchmark scenarios with rotational, shear, and diffusive transport; successfully implemented on IBM Quantum hardware using 16 qubits.

Conclusion: The quantum algorithm proves robust and practically applicable for solving advection-diffusion equations with complex transport fields, showing promise for quantum computing applications in PDE solving.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to solve the advection-diffusion equation under
arbitrary transporting fields using a quantum-inspired 'Schrodingerisation'
technique for Hamiltonian simulation. Although numerous methods exist for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hamiltonian simulation remains a
relatively underexplored yet promising direction-particularly in the context of
long-term, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Building on this potential, our
quantum algorithm is designed to accommodate non-trivial, spatially varying
transport fields and is applicable to both 2D and 3D advection-diffusion
problems. To ensure numerical stability and accuracy, the algorithm combines an
upwinding discretization scheme for the advective component and the central
differencing for diffusion, adapted for quantum implementation through a
tailored mix of approximation and optimization techniques. We demonstrate the
algorithm's effectiveness on benchmark scenarios involving coupled rotational,
shear, and diffusive transport in two and three dimensions. Additionally, we
implement the 2D advection-diffusion equation using 16 qubits on IBM Quantum
hardware, validating our method and highlighting its practical applicability

Conclusion: DIQCD provides an accurate and efficient framework for predicting open quantum system dynamics from limited experimental data, applicable to both quantum devices and material science problems.

Abstract: We introduce a data-informed quantum-classical dynamics (DIQCD) approach for

DIQCD for both experimental and simulated quantum devices. We show that DIQCD

*Ridwan Sakidja*

TL;DR: A compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems with structured baths using finite qubit layers instead of continuum approximations, enabling direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and spectral analysis via FFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum systems, treating structured baths as collaborative partners rather than noise to be eliminated.

Method: Models bath as finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, uses triangle-based bath motif and six-qubit anisotropic fractal architecture, employs FFT for spectral analysis and ML tools (PCA, gradient boosting) for parameter inference.

Result: Demonstrates that spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth, enabling inference of bath parameters and estimation of proximity to exceptional points through machine learning analysis.

Conclusion: Spectral analysis serves as a unifying quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both pedagogical value and diagnostic power for understanding open quantum systems and non-Hermitian dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems
coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models
the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections,
interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation,
rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over
non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and
its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we
demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth.
Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate
proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral
analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory,
simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and
experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory
flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be
eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners,
enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for
engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework
offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems.
Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based
spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to
extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian
dynamics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Generalized simulated bifurcation (GSB) algorithm achieves near-perfect success rates for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems by harnessing chaos dynamics, reducing solution time from 1.3s to 10ms for 2000-variable problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the solution accuracy of dynamical-system approaches for combinatorial optimization, which are highly parallelizable but typically less accurate than discrete methods like simulated annealing.

Method: Generalized simulated bifurcation (GSB) by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters, allowing the system to operate near the edge of chaos.

Result: GSB achieved almost 100% success probabilities for large-scale problems, reducing time to solution for 2000-variable problems from 1.3s to 10ms (two orders of magnitude improvement).

Conclusion: Dynamical-system approaches can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening new possibilities for solving intractable combinatorial optimization problems using nature-inspired methods.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving
combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables.In particular,
numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a
desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them
in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading
to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with
continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches
with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution
accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated
bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum
nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize
it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and
show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success
probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution
for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine,
which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s,
previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the
ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the
nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success
probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a
solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding
suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be
enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle
intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the magnetic properties and spin dynamics of the trimer ruthenate system Ba5Ru3O12, which shows unusual magnetic behavior compared to other ruthenate trimers.

Method: Combined inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) spectroscopy, supported by linear spin wave theory calculations using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), plus theoretical calculations for isolated trimer predictions.

Result: Revealed two distinct spin wave excitations (5.6 meV and 10-15 meV), spin frustration from competing exchange interactions, non-collinear spin structure, persistent magnetic excitations above TN indicating short-range correlations, and dynamic magnetic order with local anisotropy.

Conclusion: Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits complex magnetic behavior driven by spin frustration, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in non-collinear spin structure and dynamic magnetic order with persistent short-range correlations above the ordering temperature.

Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin
relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which
undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals
two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at
10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory
using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that
Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions
between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and
strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in
contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these
magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above
TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is
further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the
initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified
through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a
dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy
within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different
hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground
state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree
with the experimentally observed spin excitation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address coverage gaps and transmission reliability issues in industrial IoT networks caused by blockages, seeking to understand how reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can improve connectivity.

Method: Analyzed single blockage scenario correlation between BS-user and RIS-user links, derived SNR distribution with multiple blockages considering data size, blockage density, RIS count, and deployment area, compared with network-controlled relays.

Result: Identified threshold for independent blockage assumption validity, showed RISs can mitigate blockage effects, but relays provide higher reliability beyond certain blockage thresholds.

Conclusion: RIS deployment offers valuable design guidelines for IIoT networks in dense blockage environments, with trade-offs between RIS count and relay-based approaches for optimal reliability.

Abstract: We study the impact of deploying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)
in mitigating coverage gaps and enhancing transmission reliability in an
industrial internet of things (IIoT) network. First, we consider a single
blockage scenario and characterize the correlation between blocking events of
the base station (BS)-user and the RIS-user links and study its impact on the
probability of establishing a viable reflected link. Then, by considering
multiple blockages, we derive the distribution of the signal to noise ratio
(SNR) as a function of data size, blockage density, the number of RISs, and the
deployment area. We analyze the impact of normalized blockage radius and
identify the threshold beyond which the assumption of independent blockages
deviates from the ground truth of correlated blocking. Finally, we compare the
outage performance of this RIS-assisted system with that operated with network-
controlled relays, and demonstrate that while the relays provide a higher
reliability beyond a certain blockage threshold, increasing the number of RISs
may help mitigate this effect. These insights offer valuable design guidelines
for deploying RIS-aided IIoT networks in dense blockage environments.

Motivation: Extend Lord Kelvin's continuum solution for Coulomb-repelling charges on spherical caps to discrete systems and understand how topological defects emerge in finite-N configurations.

Method: Developed efficient numerical method for energy minimization while fixing number of charges at cap edge, applied to various N values and cap angular widths.

Result: Obtained numerical configurations showing emergence of topological defects that depend on both number of charges N and the curvature of the spherical cap.

Conclusion: Discrete charge systems on spherical caps exhibit curvature-dependent topological defect patterns that differ from Kelvin's continuum solution, with defect behavior systematically varying with N and cap geometry.

Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges
confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the
continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a
non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary.
To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method
that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the
cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for
various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze
the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and
the cap's curvature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation and leverage this knowledge for designing selective modulators.

Method: Literature review of gating mechanisms, experimental and computational evidence of agonist binding to modulator pockets, and analysis of mutations affecting gating.

Result: Identified a potential common amphipathic modulator pocket architecture across K2P channels with channel-sequence variations that can be exploited for drug design.

Conclusion: The modulator pocket represents a key site for K2P channel activation that can be targeted for developing new selective and potent channel modulators.

Abstract: The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel
that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since
its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind
various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to
elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To
this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature
and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental
and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket,
together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate
how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to
the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator
pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure
-consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface
between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some
important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key
differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent
modulators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional line-by-line radiative transfer calculations for stellar spectra are computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck for large-scale astrophysical data analysis and real-time parameter inference.

Method: Trained a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) on SYNSPEC spectra grid covering wide parameter ranges (Teff, log g, metallicity, vsini, microturbulence) and various resolving powers. The network learns to generate spectra conditioned on these physical parameters.

Result: The CVAE generates spectra ~100x faster than traditional methods with median absolute residual <1.8e-3 flux units, no wavelength-dependent bias, and <2e-3 average residual error across all parameter planes. No relevant trends found in diagnostics versus key stellar parameters.

Conclusion: The CVAE serves as an accurate, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling for stellar parameter inference and providing efficient spectra synthesis for large astrophysical datasets.

Abstract: We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates
stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le
\log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i
\le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving
powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range
4450-5400 \AA. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network
synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than
line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra
unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual
of <$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual
error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta
F|\rangle<2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus
$T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no
relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a
drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling
real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering
promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.

### [79] [The Free Energy of an Enriched Continuous Random Energy Model in the Weak Correlation Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17313)
*Alexander Alban,Fu-Hsuan Ho,Justin Ko*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Analysis of continuous random energy model free energy using Hamilton-Jacobi approach, showing free energy is given by Hopf formula in weak correlation regime and independent of covariance function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limiting free energy of the continuous random energy model (CREM) using the Hamilton-Jacobi framework for mean-field disordered systems, particularly focusing on the weak correlation regime.

Method: Introduce an enriched model that interpolates between CREM and Ruelle probability cascade. Apply Hamilton-Jacobi approach to analyze free energy in weak correlation regime where covariance function is bounded above by identity function.

Result: In weak correlation regime, free energy is given by Hopf formula and is independent of the covariance function A. Outside this regime, Hamilton-Jacobi framework fails and variational principle may not yield correct free energy.

Conclusion: The Hamilton-Jacobi approach successfully characterizes CREM free energy in weak correlation regime, revealing covariance-independent behavior, but breaks down outside this regime where more complex analysis is needed.

Abstract: We revisit the proof of the limiting free energy of the continuous random
energy model (CREM) using the Hamilton--Jacobi approach for mean-field
disordered systems. To achieve this, we introduce an enriched model that
interpolates between the CREM and the Ruelle probability cascade. We focus on
the weak correlation regime, where the CREM's covariance function $A$ is
bounded above by the identity function.
  In the weak correlation regime, we show that the free energy is given by the
Hopf formula. The resulting expression is independent of $A$, confirming that
in this regime the free energy does not depend on the precise form of the
covariance function. Outside of the weak correlation regime, the
Hamilton--Jacobi framework no longer applies. Moreover, we provide an example
where a formal application of the associated variational principle fails to
yield the correct free energy.

Abstract: We present a novel spectral solver for general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics on dynamical spacetimes. By combining a high order
discontinuous spectral method on mapped Chebyshev Fourier grids, our scheme
attains exponential convergence. Implemented within a unified BSSN Valencia
framework, the code evolves both Einstein and MHD fields self consistently,
enabling fully coupled simulations of black hole accretion jet systems. We
demonstrate spectral accuracy and entropy stability through convergence tests,
and validate physical fidelity via equatorial embedding diagrams of horizon
crossing GRMHD variables in Kerr Schild coordinates. Three dimensional scatter
visualizations further highlight the solver's capability to capture complex
magnetized plasma structures around rotating black holes. This approach paves
the way for high order, low dissipation GRMHD simulations on exascale
architectures, opening new avenues for precise modeling of strong field
astrophysical phenomena.
