Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play\na significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by\nkinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than\ndirectly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a\nreduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the\nunderlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the\ncomputational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional\nkinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally,\nmoment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based\ncontrol framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios.

Second, we derive a uniform\nspectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate\nsolution. To achieve this, we introduce a suitable basis decomposition and a\ncoordinate transformation to reduce the problem to spectral analysis of two\nscalar one-dimensional linear operators and some singular product estimates. To\naddress the difficulties arising from anisotropic elasticity and the strong\nanchoring boundary condition, we introduce a div-curl decomposition and, when\nestimating the cross terms, combine these with the anisotropic elastic terms to\nclose the energy estimates."}

Across an ensemble of NEB\ncalculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of\ncompositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered\nstructures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile\nthan Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of\nthe ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure.\nSpecifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice\ndistortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around\nvacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms\nremain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a\nkey role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe\natoms.
