### [1] [Controlling instability in the Vlasov-Poisson system through moment-based optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18412)
*Jingcheng Lu,Li Wang,Jeff Calder*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Proposes moment-based control framework to suppress kinetic plasma instabilities using external electric fields, avoiding computationally expensive full kinetic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost of repeatedly solving high-dimensional kinetic equations during electric field optimization, and leverage more accessible moment-based data for practical data-driven control applications.

Method: Uses reduced-order moment-based system instead of full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson equations to capture plasma dynamics. Designs external electric field control through analytical and numerical comparison with full kinetic model control.

Result: Investigates effectiveness of moment-based control approach for suppressing kinetic plasma instabilities.

Conclusion: Moment-based control framework provides computationally efficient alternative to full kinetic simulations for plasma instability suppression, with practical advantages for data-driven applications.

Abstract: Controlling instability in plasma is one of the central challenges in fusion
energy research. Among the various sources of instability, kinetic effects play
a significant role. In this work, we aim to suppress the instability induced by
kinetic effects by designing an external electric field. However, rather than
directly solving the full kinetic Vlasov-Poisson system, we focus on a
reduced-order model, specifically the moment-based system, to capture the
underlying dynamics. This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the
computational cost associated with repeatedly solving the high-dimensional
kinetic equations during the optimization of the electric field. Additionally,
moment-based data is more readily accessible in practice, making a moment-based
control framework more adaptable to data-driven scenarios. We investigate the
effectiveness of moment-based control both analytically and numerically, by
comparing it to control based on the full kinetic model.

### [2] [High-Dimensional Quasi-Monte Carlo via Combinatorial Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18426)
*Jiaheng Chen,Haotian Jiang,Nathan Kirk*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a new approach to constructing high-dimensional Quasi-Monte Carlo point sets using combinatorial discrepancy methods, extending previous work by Bansal and Jiang. The research provides theoretical error bounds in weighted function spaces and for functions with low effective dimension, supported by numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QMC methods face tractability challenges in high dimensions due to rapidly growing worst-case error bounds. The motivation is to develop more effective QMC constructions that can handle high-dimensional integration problems without relying heavily on additional structural assumptions like low effective dimension or carefully chosen coordinate weights.

Method: The method involves constructing high-dimensional QMC point sets through combinatorial discrepancy techniques, building upon the recent QMC approach by Bansal and Jiang. The research establishes theoretical error bounds for these constructions in weighted function spaces and analyzes performance for functions with low effective dimension in both superposition and truncation senses.

Result: The paper provides theoretical error bounds for the proposed QMC constructions in high dimensions. Numerical experiments are conducted to empirically evaluate the performance of these constructions, demonstrating their effectiveness compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The combinatorial discrepancy-based approach offers a promising method for constructing high-dimensional QMC point sets that can achieve better performance than classical methods, particularly in challenging high-dimensional integration problems where traditional QMC methods struggle with tractability issues.

Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are classical approaches
for the numerical integration of functions $f$ over $[0,1]^d$. While QMC
methods can achieve faster convergence rates than MC in moderate dimensions,
their tractability in high dimensions typically relies on additional structure
-- such as low effective dimension or carefully chosen coordinate weights --
since worst-case error bounds grow prohibitively large as $d$ increases.
  In this work, we study the construction of high-dimensional QMC point sets
via combinatorial discrepancy, extending the recent QMC method of Bansal and
Jiang. We establish error bounds for these constructions in weighted function
spaces, and for functions with low effective dimension in both the
superposition and truncation sense. We also present numerical experiments to
empirically assess the performance of these constructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient numerical methods for solving BSDEs by extending classical Runge-Kutta theory to the stochastic setting.

Method: Extend classical Butcher theory from ODEs to BSDEs to systematically derive order conditions for explicit Runge-Kutta schemes with arbitrary stages and orders.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a systematic framework for constructing high-order explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for BSDEs, extending classical numerical methods to stochastic settings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new class of explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for

### [4] [Convergence and error analysis of a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Gray--Scott system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18910)
*Tsiry Avisoa Randrianasolo*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Semi-implicit finite volume scheme for Gray-Scott system with proven unconditional well-posedness, qualitative properties, convergence to weak solutions, and first-order convergence rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust numerical scheme for the Gray-Scott system that can accurately capture pattern formation in chemical and biological media while maintaining mathematical properties like positivity and boundedness.

Method: Semi-implicit finite volume discretization approach with compactness arguments for convergence analysis and a priori error estimates in L^2 norm under additional regularity assumptions.

Result: Proved unconditional well-posedness, established qualitative properties (positivity and boundedness), demonstrated strong convergence to weak solutions, and obtained first-order convergence rate in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-implicit finite volume scheme is effective for simulating Gray-Scott patterns, with rigorous mathematical foundation and validated numerical performance showing order 1 convergence.

Abstract: We analyze a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the Gray--Scott system, a
model for pattern formation in chemical and biological media. We prove
unconditional well-posedness of the fully discrete problem and establish
qualitative properties, including positivity and boundedness of the numerical
solution. A convergence result is obtained by compactness arguments, showing
that the discrete approximations converge strongly to a weak solution of the
continuous system. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further derive a
priori error estimates in the $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments validate the
theoretical analysis, confirm a rate of convergence of order 1, and illustrate
the ability of the scheme to capture classical Gray--Scott patterns.

### [5] [An online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for parameterized component-based nonlinear systems using hierarchical error estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19027)
*Mehran Ebrahimi,Masayuki Yano*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Online-adaptive hyperreduced RBEM for parameterized nonlinear systems with component-wise error estimation and adaptive fidelity selection to achieve computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient model order reduction method for complex parameterized nonlinear systems with many components, enabling adaptive fidelity control to meet system-level error tolerance.

Method: Offline library preparation of hyperreduced archetype components at various fidelity levels, online adaptive assembly with hierarchical error estimation and component-wise refinement using empirical quadrature.

Result: Achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level for nonlinear thermal fin systems with up to 225 components and 68 parameters, outperforming uniform refinement.

Conclusion: The adaptive hyperreduced RBEM provides effective error control and significant computational savings for large-scale parameterized nonlinear component-based systems.

Abstract: We present an online-adaptive hyperreduced reduced basis element method for
model order reduction of parameterized, component-based nonlinear systems. The
method, in the offline phase, prepares a library of hyperreduced archetype
components of various fidelity levels and, in the online phase, assembles the
target system using instantiated components whose fidelity is adaptively
selected to satisfy a user-prescribed system-level error tolerance. To achieve
this, we introduce a hierarchical error estimation framework that compares
solutions at successive fidelity levels and drives a local refinement strategy
based on component-wise error indicators. We also provide an efficient
estimator for the system-level error to ensure that the adaptive strategy meets
the desired accuracy. Component-wise hyperreduction is performed using an
empirical quadrature procedure, with the training accuracy guided by the
Brezzi--Rappaz--Raviart theorem. The proposed method is demonstrated on a
family of nonlinear thermal fin systems comprising up to 225 components and 68
parameters. Numerical results show that the hyperreduced basis element model
achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level relative to the truth
finite-element model. In addition, the adaptive refinement strategy provides
more effective error control than uniform refinement by selectively enriching
components with higher local errors.

*Riccardo Mannella*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Re-evaluation of Heun algorithm for SDE integration shows standard Heun remains benchmark despite being low-order, disproves previous strong convergence claim.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically re-examine the widely used Heun algorithm for numerical integration of stochastic differential equations and evaluate alternative implementations.

Method: Discussion and evaluation of several alternative implementations through extensive numerical simulations assessing convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties.

Result: Standard Heun scheme maintains robust performance and remains benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs.

Conclusion: Standard Heun algorithm is confirmed as reliable benchmark despite being constructed from low-order integrator; previous claim about its strong convergence is disproved.

Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and
evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the
standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The
convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are
assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the
standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to
its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a
previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun
scheme.

### [7] [Momentum Equation-Based Regularization and Image Registration for Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19086)
*Olalekan A. Babaniyi,Rebecca Rodrigues,Michael S. Richards*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Momentum-based regularization outperforms traditional strain-based methods in ultrasound elastography registration, with plane stress assumption achieving best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quasi-static ultrasound elastography by evaluating and comparing mechanics-based regularization strategies against traditional methods in variational image registration frameworks.

Method: Reformulated momentum-equation-based post-processing as regularization term in image registration energy functional. Compared four regularization types: strain magnitude, strain magnitude with incompressibility, and momentum-based under plane strain and plane stress assumptions. Used variational framework with Gauss-Newton optimization on synthetic and experimental phantom data.

Result: Momentum-based regularization (especially plane stress assumption) achieved lowest strain errors and highest strain contrast in both single-frame and accumulated measurements, even when tissue deformation violated 2D assumptions. Strain magnitude with incompressibility produced unstable results in 3D and accumulated scenarios.

Conclusion: Mechanics-based regularization incorporating momentum conservation outperforms strain-based techniques, improving robustness to noise and model mismatch, offering promising direction for displacement-based inverse imaging methods.

Abstract: Objective: Evaluate and compare multiple mechanics-based and traditional
regularization strategies within a variational image registration framework for
quasi-static ultrasound elastography. Methods:We reformulate a previously
proposed momentum-equation-based post-processing method (SPREME) as a
regularization term directly integrated into an image registration energy
functional. Four regularization types are implemented and compared: a strain
magnitude ($\R_\epsilon$), a strain magnitude with incompressibility constraint
($R_{\epsilon i}$), and a momentum-based regularization under plane strain
($R_{P\epsilon}$) and plane stress ($R_{P\sigma}$) assumptions. Each is
evaluated in a variational framework solved via Gauss-Newton optimization.
Data:Registration performance is assessed using synthetic ultrasound image
sequences generated from 2D and 3D finite element simulations, as well as
experimental phantom data. Comparisons are based on displacement and strain
field errors, strain contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Results:
Momentum-based regularization, particularly under plane stress assumptions
($R_{P\sigma}$), achieved the lowest strain errors and highest strain contrast
across both single-frame and accumulated measurements, even when the underlying
tissue deformation violated 2D assumptions. In contrast, strain magnitude
regularization with an incompressibility constraint ($R_{\epsilon i}$) produced
unstable results in 3D and accumulated displacement scenarios. Conclusions:
Mechanics-based regularization that incorporates momentum conservation
outperforms strain-based techniques in elastographic image registration,
particularly when applied directly in the optimization framework. This approach
improves robustness to noise and model mismatch, offering a promising direction
for future displacement-based inverse imaging methods.

Method: Uses multi-point Padé approximation of the Laplace transform combined with a highly efficient continued fraction technique to construct rational approximants.

Result: Demonstrated high accuracy across various functions including Gaussian, probability density functions (lognormal, Gompertz-Makeham), hockey stick, unit step functions, and functions related to gamma and Barnes G-functions.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective approach for approximating real-valued functions using exponential functions with complex coefficients, showing strong performance across diverse mathematical functions.

Abstract: We present a new method for approximating real-valued functions on ${\mathbb
R}^+$ by linear combinations of exponential functions with complex
coefficients. The approach is based on a multi-point Pad\'e approximation of
the Laplace transform and employs a highly efficient continued fraction
technique to construct the corresponding rational approximant. We demonstrate
the accuracy of this method through a variety of examples, including the
Gaussian function, probability density functions of the lognormal and
Gompertz-Makeham distributions, the hockey stick and unit step functions, as
well as a function arising in the approximation of the gamma and Barnes
$G$-functions.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Stoch-IDENT is a novel method for identifying Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) from observational data, handling linear/nonlinear high-order SPDEs with time-dependent Wiener processes and additive/multiplicative structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust method for identifying SPDEs from data, establishing theoretical connections between spectral properties and identifiability, generalizing deterministic PDE identification theory to stochastic settings.

Method: Combines sample mean generalization of Robust-IDENT for drift term identification with new Quadratic Subspace Pursuit (QSP) greedy algorithm for diffusion term identification, addressing sparse regression with quadratic measurements.

Result: The method is extensively validated on various SPDEs, demonstrating effectiveness through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across different equation types.

Conclusion: Stoch-IDENT provides a comprehensive framework for SPDE identification with theoretical guarantees and practical algorithmic solutions, successfully generalizing deterministic PDE identification approaches to stochastic settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Stoch-IDENT, a novel method for identifying
Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) from observational data. Our
method can handle linear and nonlinear high-order SPDEs driven by
time-dependent Wiener processes with both additive or multiplicative
structures. Theoretically, we establish a rigorous connection between the
spectral properties of the solution's mean and covariance and the
identifiability of the underlying SPDEs. Our analysis covers key classes of
equations, including linear SPDEs with constant coefficients, as well as
parabolic and hyperbolic types, generalizing the theory of identification of
deterministic PDEs. Algorithmically, the drift term is identified using a
sample mean generalization of Robust-IDENT (He et al., 2023). For the diffusion
term, we develop a new greedy algorithm, Quadratic Subspace Pursuit (QSP),
which can address general sparse regression problems with quadratic
measurements. We validate Stoch-IDENT extensively on various SPDEs,
demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable and accurate numerical method for solving incompressible surface Navier-Stokes equations on moving surfaces, which is important for modeling fluid flow on deformable interfaces in various physical applications.

Method: Parametric finite elements of degree ℓ ≥ 2 for discrete representation of the moving surface, with semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation and stability analysis that mirrors the continuous problem.

Conclusion: The proposed numerical approach provides a stable and accurate framework for approximating incompressible surface Navier-Stokes equations on evolving surfaces, with theoretical backing and practical validation.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of the incompressible
surface Navier--Stokes equations on an evolving surface. For the discrete
representation of the moving surface we use parametric finite elements of

able to prove a stability estimate that mimics a corresponding result for the
continuous problem. Some numerical results, including a convergence experiment,
demonstrate the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method.

*Juhi Jang,Ian Tice*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Construction of nearly spherical axisymmetric solutions for compressible barotropic fluids in gravity using bifurcation analysis in weighted Sobolev spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study stationary configurations of compressible fluids in incompressible fluids under gravity, where simple spherical geometries become impossible due to density stratification.

Method: Bifurcation argument in weighted Sobolev spaces defined via Legendre operator, developing new functional analytic tools for these spaces.

Result: Successfully constructed smooth solutions with nontrivial gravity and nearly spherical axisymmetric geometry.

Conclusion: The developed mathematical framework enables analysis of compressible fluid configurations under gravity, providing essential tools for studying such systems with complex geometries.

Abstract: We study stationary configurations of compressible barotropic fluids lying
inside an incompressible fluid and acted upon by a constant gravitational
field. Without gravity, it is a simple matter to construct solutions consisting
of perfectly spherical bubbles of compressible fluid, but with gravity the
stratification of the compressible fluid's density prevents the existence of
solutions with such simple geometries. We construct smooth solutions with
nontrivial gravity and nearly spherical, axisymmetric geometry by means of a
bifurcation argument in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, defined in terms
of the Legendre operator. Along the way, we develop a number of essential
linear and nonlinear functional analytic tools for this scale of spaces, which
are of independent interest.

### [12] [Perturbations of globally hypoelliptic pseudo-differential operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18418)
*Pedro Meyer Tokoro*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Global regularity stability for pseudo-differential operators under lower-order perturbations, particularly for Shubin and SG classes, but not for standard Hörmander classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how global regularity properties of pseudo-differential operators are affected by lower-order perturbations, which is important for analyzing the stability of solutions to partial differential equations.

Method: The paper establishes that operators with globally hypoelliptic symbols maintain their global regularity (in Schwartz functions and tempered distributions sense) when perturbed by sufficiently lower-order operators.

Result: The global regularity is preserved under lower-order perturbations for operators in Shubin and SG classes, but this stability result does not hold for standard Hörmander classes.

Conclusion: The study provides a stability result for global regularity under perturbations, highlighting the different behavior between Shubin/SG classes and standard Hörmander classes of pseudo-differential operators.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the stability of the global regularity for a class of
pseudo-differential operators under lower-order perturbations. We establish
that if an operator has a globally hypoelliptic symbol, its global regularity
(in the sense of Schwartz functions and tempered distributions) is preserved
when perturbed by operators of sufficiently lower order. This result applies in
particular to operators within the Shubin and SG classes. Furthermore, we
discuss why this stability result does not hold in the standard H\"ormander
classes.

Motivation: To establish rigorous gradient bounds for solutions of degenerate quasilinear elliptic equations in non-divergence form with Hamiltonian terms, which are important for understanding regularity properties of such nonlinear PDEs

Method: Mathematical analysis of quasilinear elliptic models using techniques from PDE theory, particularly focusing on non-divergence form equations with degeneracy law and Hamiltonian terms

Conclusion: The work provides important gradient bounds for a class of quasilinear models with Hamiltonian terms, contributing to the understanding of regularity properties in degenerate elliptic PDEs

Abstract: In this work, we establish global gradient estimates to solutions of
quasilinear elliptic models in non-divergence form with general degeneracy law
and a Hamiltonian term, given by $$ -\Psi(x, |\nabla
u|)\Delta_p^{\mathrm{N}}u(x)+\mathscr{H}(x,\nabla u)=f(x) \quad \mathrm{in}
\quad \Omega, \quad \mathrm{for} \,\,\,1<p< \infty, $$ under suitable

### [14] [$(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of Navier-Stokes equations with additive white noise on two-dimensional torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18745)
*Hongyong Cui,Hui Liu,Jie Xin*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Regularity analysis of 2D Navier-Stokes equations with additive white noise, proving finite fractal dimension of random attractor in H^2 space under specific noise intensity conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish regularity properties and finite-dimensional attractors for stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with additive white noise, extending deterministic results to the stochastic case.

Method: Indirect approach estimating H^2-distance between stochastic and deterministic solutions; establishing H^2 bounded absorbing set and (H,H^2)-smoothing effect; using box-counting fractal dimension analysis.

Result: Proved existence of tempered (H,H^2)-random attractor with finite fractal dimension in H^2 space under condition ‖∇h‖_{L^∞} ≤ √πνλ_1.

Conclusion: The stochastic Navier-Stokes system exhibits good regularity properties with finite-dimensional attractors in higher regularity spaces, even with external force only in H space.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the regularity of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with
additive white noise on two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$. Under the
conditions that the external force $f(x)$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and
the noise intensity function $h(x)$ satisfies $\|\nabla h\|_{L^\infty} \leq
\sqrt \pi \nu \lambda_1$, where $ \nu $ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid
and $\lambda_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the Stokes operator, it was proved
that the random NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor
whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by
establishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an
$(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and
finite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force
$f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the
$H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of
estimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random NS equations
and that of the corresponding deterministic equations.

### [15] [Asymptotic limit of a vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation for phase transition dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18754)
*Huan Dong,Wei Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation asymptotic limit showing convergence to two-phase flow system with mean curvature interface, harmonic map heat flow in bulk, and mixed boundary conditions across interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study the asymptotic behavior of vector-valued Allen-Cahn equations modeling chemical reactions, diffusions, and phase transitions, extending previous work from n=2 to general dimensions.

Method: Employ matched asymptotic expansion method with quasi-minimal connecting orbits to construct approximate solutions, derive uniform spectral lower bounds for linearized operators using novel boundary condition application and decomposition techniques.

Result: Established that the sharp interface limit yields: (i) interface evolves by mean curvature flow, (ii) bulk solution follows harmonic map heat flow into S^{n-1}, (iii) S^{n-1}-valued vectors satisfy mixed boundary condition across interface.

Conclusion: Rigorous justification of the asymptotic limit for vector-valued Allen-Cahn equations provides comprehensive understanding of interface dynamics and bulk behavior in multi-phase systems with spherical symmetry constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic limit, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, of
solutions to a vector-valued Allen-Cahn equation $$ \partial_t u = \Delta u -
\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \partial_u F(u), $$ where $u: \Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $F(u): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a
nonnegative radial function which vanishes precisely on two concentric spheres.
This equation, proposed and studied by Bronsard and Stoth [Trans. Amer. Math.
Soc. 1998] for the case $n=2$, serves as a typical example for a general
reaction-diffusion equation introduced by Rubinstein, Sternberg, and Keller to
model chemical reactions and diffusions as well as phase transitions. We
establish that the sharp interface limit is a two-phase flow system: (i) The
interface evolves by mean curvature flow; (ii) Within the bulk phase regions,
the solution follows the harmonic map heat flow into $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$; (iii)
Across the interface, the $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$-valued vectors on the two sides
satisfy a mixed boundary condition.
  Furthermore, we rigorously justify this limit using the matched asymptotic
expansion method. First, we employ the idea of ``quasi-minimal connecting
orbits'' developed in Fei, Lin, Wang, and Zhang [Invent. Math. 2023] to
construct approximated solutions up to arbitrary order. Second, we derive a
uniform spectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate
solution, which relies on a novel application of the boundary condition. To
achieve this, we introduce a suitable decomposition which can reduce the
problem to spectral analysis of two scalar one-dimensional linear operators and
some singular product estimates.

### [16] [On the asymptotic limit for the dynamic isotropic-nematic phase transition with anisotropic elasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18800)
*Huan Dong,Siqi Ren,Wei Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Rigorous justification of Landau-de Gennes to sharp interface limit for isotropic-nematic phase transition with anisotropic elasticity, verifying de Gennes' claim about surface tension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically validate de Gennes' theoretical prediction about surface tension strength at isotropic-nematic interfaces in dynamical settings using rigorous asymptotic analysis.

Method: Matched asymptotic expansions with quasi-minimal connecting orbits to construct approximate solutions, spectral analysis of linearized operators using basis decomposition and coordinate transformation, div-curl decomposition to handle anisotropic elasticity and strong anchoring conditions.

Result: Successfully derived the sharp interface limit where interface evolves by mean curvature, Q=0 in isotropic region, Q=s_+(nn-1/3I) in nematic region with alignment vector satisfying specific evolution equation, and strong anchoring n=ν on interface.

Conclusion: The work provides rigorous mathematical foundation for de Gennes' surface tension claim and establishes the connection between Landau-de Gennes dynamics and sharp interface models for liquid crystal phase transitions.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the isotropic-nematic phase transition with
anisotropic elasticity governed by the Landau-de Gennes dynamics of liquid
crystals. For $-\frac{3}{2}< L<0,$ we rigorously justify the limit from the
Landau-de Gennes flow to a sharp interface system characterized by a two-phase
flow: The interface evolves via motion by mean curvature; In the isotropic
region, $Q=0$; In the nematic region, $Q=s_+(nn-\frac{1}{3}I)$ with $n\in
\mathbb{S}^2$ and $s_+>0$, where the alignment vector field $n$ satisfies
$$(2s_+^2\partial_t n+h)\times n=0$$ and $h=-\frac{\delta E(n,\nabla n)}{\delta
n}$ with $E(n,\nabla n)$ denoting the Oseen-Frank energy; On the interface, the
strong anchoring condition $n=\nu$ is satisfied. This result rigorously
verifies a claim made by de Gennes [Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1971] regarding the
surface tension strength of isotropic-nematic interfaces in dynamical settings.
  Furthermore, we rigorously justify this limit using the method of matched
asymptotic expansions. First, we employ the idea of ``quasi-minimal connecting
orbits'' developed by Fei-Lin-Wang-Zhang [Invent.math. 2023] to construct
approximated solutions up to arbitrary order. Second, we derive a uniform
spectral lower bound for the linearized operator around the approximate
solution. To achieve this, we introduce a suitable basis decomposition and a
coordinate transformation to reduce the problem to spectral analysis of two
scalar one-dimensional linear operators and some singular product estimates. To
address the difficulties arising from anisotropic elasticity and the strong
anchoring boundary condition, we introduce a div-curl decomposition and, when
estimating the cross terms, combine these with the anisotropic elastic terms to

### [17] [On restricted-type Strichartz estimates and the applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18827)
*Yangkendi Deng,Han Wang,Yuzhao Wang,Zehua Zhao*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Rigorous analysis of Zakharov system on waveguide manifolds ℝ^m×𝕋^n, establishing global shell-type Strichartz estimates without derivative loss on ℝ²×𝕋 but showing failure on ℝ×𝕋². Numerical verification confirms theoretical dichotomy. Applications include first local well-posedness for partially periodic Zakharov system and supercritical NLS with strip-type data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model nonlinear coupling between optical and acoustic modes in confined geometries like optical fibers, and understand dispersive effects in hybrid geometries to provide mathematical foundations for efficient waveguide design and signal transmission.

Method: Framework establishment using measure estimates of semi-algebraic sets, construction of counter-examples, derivation of shell-type Strichartz estimates in various dimensions, and numerical verification of spacetime bounds.

Result: Global validity of sharp shell-type Strichartz estimate on ℝ²×𝕋 without derivative loss, but failure on ℝ×𝕋². Numerical results show uniform L⁴-spacetime bound on ℝ²×𝕋 vs sublinear growth on ℝ×𝕋². First local well-posedness theory for partially periodic Zakharov system established.

Conclusion: Different waveguide geometries exhibit fundamentally different dispersive properties, with ℝ²×𝕋 supporting good estimates while ℝ×𝕋² fails. Findings advance understanding of confinement effects and provide deterministic analogues to random data theory for supercritical NLS.

Abstract: We establish a rigorous framework for the Zakharov system on waveguide
manifolds $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$ ($m,n\geq 1$), which models the
nonlinear coupling between optical and acoustic modes in confined geometries
such as optical fibers. Our analysis reveals that the sharp \textit{shell-type
Strichartz estimate} for $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$ is globally valid in
time and exhibits no derivative loss via the measure estimate of semi-algebraic
sets, unlike the periodic case studied in \cite{MR4665720}. In addition, we
demonstrate that such an estimate fails on the product space $\mathbb{R} \times
\mathbb{T}^2$ by constructing a counter-example.
  Moreover, we derive analogues of these shell-type estimates in other
dimensions, both in the waveguide and Euclidean settings. As a direct
application, we establish, for the first time, a local well-posedness theory
for the partially periodic Zakharov system. To summarize, we compare shell-type
Strichartz estimates in different settings (the Euclidean, the periodic, and
the waveguide).
  Numerical verification on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$ reveals a uniform
$L^4$-spacetime bound, while $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^2$ exhibits sublinear
growth, quantitatively confirming the theoretical dichotomy between geometries
with different dimensional confinement.
  These findings advance the understanding of dispersive effects in hybrid
geometries and provide mathematical foundations for efficient waveguide design
and signal transmission.
  Finally, for the Euclidean case, we establish well-posedness theory for
supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with \textit{strip-type}
frequency-restricted initial data, revealing a trade-off between dispersion and
confinement, which is of independent mathematical interest. This provides a
deterministic analogue to random data theory of NLS.

Motivation: Study ground state solutions, sign-changing solutions, and multiplicity of solutions for discrete fractional logarithmic Kirchhoff equations on Z^d lattice

Method: Mountain-pass theorem for ground state solutions (p>4), Nehari manifold method for sign-changing solutions (p>6), and establishment of multiple nontrivial weak solutions

Result: Proved existence of ground state solutions, ground state sign-changing solutions, and multiplicity of nontrivial weak solutions under suitable assumptions on h(x)

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes comprehensive existence and multiplicity results for discrete fractional logarithmic Kirchhoff equations using variational methods and topological approaches

Abstract: In this paper, we study the discrete fractional logarithmic Kirchhoff

$a,\,b>0$ and $0<s<1$. Under suitable assumptions on $h(x)$, we first prove the
existence of ground state solutions by the mountain-pass theorem for $p>4$;
then we verify the existence of ground state sign-changing solutions based on
the method of Nehari manifold for $p>6$. Finally, we establish the multiplicity

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a large mass limit of the non-local isoperimetric problem with a
repulsive Yukawa potential in two space dimensions. In this limit, the
non-local term concentrates on the boundary, resulting in the existence of a
critical regime in which the perimeter and the non-local terms cancel each
other out to leading order. We show that under appropriate scaling assumptions
the next-order $\Gamma$-limit of the energy with respect to the $L^1$
convergence of the rescaled sets is given by a weighted sum of the perimeter
and Euler's elastica functional, where the latter is understood via the
lower-semicontinuous relaxation and is evaluated on the system of boundary
curves. As a consequence, we prove that in the considered regime the energy
minimizers always exist and converge to either disks or annuli, depending on
the relative strength of the elastica term.

Motivation: To study how non-compact, complete curves in Euclidean space preserve positive properties under elastic flow, despite the canonical elastic energy being infinite in this context.

Method: Extends recent work using adapted elastic energy to derive optimal thresholds for maintaining planar embeddedness and graphicality of curves. Also develops a new Li-Yau type inequality for complete planar curves.

Result: Establishes nontrivial optimal thresholds that preserve planar embeddedness and graphicality properties for elastic flow of non-compact complete curves.

Conclusion: The adapted elastic energy approach successfully addresses the infinite energy problem and provides meaningful thresholds for maintaining important geometric properties in non-compact settings.

Abstract: We study positivity-preserving properties for the elastic flow of
non-compact, complete curves in Euclidean space. Despite the fact that the
canonical elastic energy is infinite in this context, we extend our recent work
based on the adapted elastic energy to derive nontrivial optimal thresholds for

a new Li--Yau type inequality for complete planar curves.

### [21] [Vanishing Angular Viscosity Limit For Micropolar Fluid Model In $\mathbb{R}_+^2$: Boundary Layer And Optimal Convergence Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18980)
*Yinghui Wang,Weihao Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper establishes the vanishing angular viscosity limit for the 2D micropolar fluid model in the upper half-plane, showing convergence from positive to zero angular viscosity cases with optimal convergence rates and revealing strong boundary layer formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the well-understood positive angular viscosity model and the zero angular viscosity model by rigorously justifying the vanishing diffusion limit, which was previously unknown despite existing results for both individual cases.

Method: Constructs Prandtl-type boundary layer profiles and combines anisotropic Sobolev spaces with careful energy estimates to handle the nonlinear interaction between velocity and angular velocity fields.

Result: Successfully justifies the vanishing angular viscosity limit of global strong solutions without smallness assumptions on initial data, reveals emergence of strong boundary layer in angular velocity field, and obtains optimal L∞ convergence rate.

Conclusion: The vanishing angular viscosity limit is rigorously established, demonstrating that solutions converge from the full diffusive system to the partially diffusive system with optimal rates, while a strong boundary layer forms in the micro-rotation velocity field during this process.

Abstract: We consider the initial-boundary value problem for the incompressible
two-dimensional micropolar fluid model with angular viscosity in the upper
half-plane. This model describes the motion of viscous fluids with
microstructure. The global well-posedness of strong solutions for this problem
with positive angular viscosity can be established via the standard energy
method, as presented in the classical monograph [\L kaszewicz, {\it Micropolar
fluids: Theory and applications.} Birkh\"auser, 1999]. Corresponding results
for the zero angular viscosity case were established recently in [Liu, Wang,
{\it Commun. Math. Sci.} 16 (2018), no. 8, 2147-2165]. However, the link
between the positive angular viscosity model (the full diffusive system) and
the zero angular viscosity model (the partially diffusive system) via the
vanishing diffusion limit remains unknown. In this work, we first construct
Prandtl-type boundary layer profiles. We then provide a rigorous justification
for the vanishing angular viscosity limit of global strong solutions, without
imposing smallness assumptions on the initial data. Our analysis reveals the
emergence of a strong boundary layer in the angular velocity field
(micro-rotation velocity of the fluid particles) during this vanishing
viscosity process. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal $L^\infty$ convergence
rate as the angular viscosity tends to zero. Our approach combines anisotropic
Sobolev spaces with careful energy estimates to address the nonlinear
interaction between the velocity and angular velocity fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop explicit and stable reconstruction methods for photoacoustic tomography with different measurement surface geometries, addressing the inversion of the forward operator R^a.

Method: Extended the domain of R^a to tempered distributions for planar geometry to characterize its range, and used L^2 spaces for spherical geometry to derive filtered backprojection-type reconstruction formulas.

Result: For planar geometry: established unique inverse operator with 'almost' continuity in distributional topology. For spherical geometry: derived stable reconstruction formula of filtered backprojection type.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete mathematical framework and explicit reconstruction formulas for photoacoustic tomography with both planar and spherical measurement geometries, ensuring stability and uniqueness of solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas for two common
measurement geometries: a plane and a sphere. The problem is formulated as
inverting the forward operator $R^a$, which maps the initial source to the
measured wave data. Our first result pertains to planar observation surfaces.
By extending the domain of $R^a$ to tempered distributions, we provide a
complete characterization of its range and establish that the inverse operator
$(R^a)^{-1}$ is uniquely defined and "almost" continuous in the distributional
topology. Our second result addresses the case of a spherical observation
geometry. Here, with the operator acting on $L^2$ spaces, we derive a stable
reconstruction formula of the filtered backprojection type.

TL;DR: Global strong solutions exist for tumor growth model with large viscosity and small initial gradient, showing regularizing effects of growth/death terms. Long-time behavior analyzed via level-set evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study well-posedness of tumor growth model described by coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE system, moving beyond previous weak solution results to establish existence of more regular strong solutions.

Method: Analyze nonlinear tumor growth model using transport equation for cell density with Brinkman-type flow potential. Employ mathematical analysis for sufficiently large viscosity and small initial gradient norm to prove global strong solution existence.

Result: Demonstrated that for sufficiently large viscosity, the tumor growth system admits nontrivial global strong solutions for positive initial data with sufficiently small gradient norm. Characterized long-time behavior through level-set analysis of flow transport dynamics.

Conclusion: The source term representing tumor cell growth and death has regularizing effects on transport dynamics. This work establishes global existence of strong/classical solutions, advancing beyond previous weak solution results for this tumor growth system.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we study a nonlinear model of tumor growth, described by
a coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system of partial differential equations. In this
model, the compressible flow of tumor cells is modeled by a transport equation
for the cell density, which takes into account transport via a background flow
(given by a potential solving a Brinkman-type equation), and which has a source
term modeling cell growth and death. In this manuscript, we show that for
sufficiently large viscosity, the tumor growth system admits nontrivial global
strong solutions for positive initial data having a gradient with sufficiently
small norm. This illustrates the regularizing effects of the source term
representing tumor cell growth and death on the resulting transport dynamics of
the equation. Furthermore, we characterize the long-time behavior of global
strong solutions to the tumor growth system using a level-set analysis, in
which we analyze how level sets evolve as they are transported by the flow, in
terms of expansion/contraction and accretion/depletion of cells. While there
has been past work on global existence of weak solutions for this tumor growth
system, this manuscript opens the study of well-posedness in terms of more
regular strong/classical solutions, which exist globally in time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously establish the existence of dark-bright soliton solutions in one-dimensional defocusing Gross-Pitaevskii systems, which are important models for Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures and nonlinear optical systems

Method: Minimizing an energy functional subject to two constraints (bright component mass and modified dark component momentum) using concentration-compactness arguments with novel estimates based on symmetric decreasing rearrangements

Result: Proved existence of traveling wave dark-bright solitons that exhibit symmetry, radial monotonicity in modulus, and propagate at subsonic speeds

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the mathematical existence of dark-bright soliton solutions in defocusing Gross-Pitaevskii systems, providing rigorous foundation for these important physical phenomena

Abstract: We rigorously establish the existence of dark-bright solitons as traveling
wave solutions to a one dimensional defocusing Gross-Pitaevskii system, a
widely used model for describing mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates and
nonlinear optical systems. These solitons are shown to exhibit symmetry and
radial monotonicity in modulus, and to propagate at subsonic speed. Our method
relies on minimizing an energy functional subject to two constraints: the mass
of the bright component and a modified momentum of the dark component. The
compactness of minimizing sequences is obtained via a concentration-compactness
argument, which requires some novel estimates based on symmetric decreasing
rearrangements.

### [25] [Spin Freezing in Oscillator Ising Machines: When Second Harmonic Injection Impedes Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18714)
*Malihe Farasat,E. M. H. E. B. Ekanayake,Nikhil Shukla*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: SHI enables oscillator Ising machines but causes spin freezing that prevents energy minimization. Specific phase initialization (π or π/2) delays freezing and improves solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second harmonic injection (SHI) is crucial for oscillator Ising machines to minimize Ising Hamiltonian, but it can cause spin freezing that impairs performance by preventing spin transitions even when they would reduce energy.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations were conducted to study spin freezing phenomenon and its sensitivity to initial phase configurations of oscillators.

Result: Spin freezing onset is highly sensitive to initial phase configuration. Initializing oscillators at specific phase values (φ = π or φ = π/2) delays freezing and consistently yields higher-quality solutions compared to random initialization.

Conclusion: Careful engineering of SHI and specific phase initialization strategies are needed for optimal performance of oscillator Ising machines, as conventional random initialization practices may lead to suboptimal results due to spin freezing.

Abstract: Second harmonic injection (SHI) has emerged as a critical mechanism in
enabling networks of coupled oscillators to function as Oscillator Ising
Machines (OIMs), capable of minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian. While SHI
facilitates phase binarization essential for mapping oscillator phases to spin
states, we demonstrate that it can also induce a previously unreported
phenomenon -- spin freezing -- where oscillator spins are unable to transition
between spin states, even when such a transition can reduce the Ising energy.
This freezing effect can impair the analog dynamics of the OIM, preventing it
from reaching lower-energy spin configurations. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations, we show that the onset of spin freezing is highly
sensitive to the initial phase configuration of the oscillators. Contrary to
conventional practice, which favors random initialization, we find that
initializing all oscillators at specific phase values ($\phi = \pi$ or $\phi =
\frac{\pi}{2}$) delays the onset of spin freezing and consistently yields
higher-quality solutions. These findings point to the need to carefully
engineer the SHI for optimal performance.

TL;DR: New semiclassical method combining Maxwell's equations with quantum DFTB electron dynamics to simulate polaritonic chemistry in realistic cavities with many molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome computational limitations of ab initio approaches for polaritonic chemistry by developing efficient semiclassical methods that can handle large systems with many degrees of freedom.

Method: Combines numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities with quantum electron dynamics at density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory level, enabling simulation of many molecules at atomistic level.

Result: Enables calculation of transmission spectra showing polaritonic signals and reveals complex individual molecular responses dependent on number, geometry, position, and orientation of molecules inside cavity.

Conclusion: The implementation provides an efficient approach for studying polaritonic chemistry in realistic experimental setups with access to both global transmission spectra and local molecular-level information.

Abstract: The large number of degrees of freedom involved in polaritonic chemistry
processes considerably restricts the systems that can be described by any ab
initio approach, due to the resulting high computational cost. Semiclassical
methods that treat light classically offer a promising route for overcoming
these limitations. In this work, we present a new implementation that combines
the numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities
with quantum electron dynamics at the density functional tight-binding (DFTB)
theory level. This implementation allows for the simulation of a large number
of molecules described at the atomistic level, interacting with cavity modes
obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. By mimicking experimental
setups, our approach enables the calculation of transmission spectra, in which
we observe the corresponding polaritonic signals. In addition, we have access
to local information, revealing complex responses of individual molecules that
depend on the number, geometry, position, and orientation of the molecules
inside the cavity.

*Lisa Sappl,Christos N. Likos,Andreas Zöttl*

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: Study of active polymers using mesoscopic simulations shows that active monomer position affects chain dynamics differently for flexible vs stiff chains, with activity-induced stiffening for head monomers and crumpling for tail monomers, independent of hydrodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the position of active monomers (head vs tail) affects structural and dynamic properties of active polymers, and how hydrodynamic interactions influence these behaviors.

Method: Employed mesoscopic simulations using multi-particle collision dynamics to study linear chains with active forces on either head or tail monomers, with and without hydrodynamic interactions.

Result: For stiff chains, active monomer position has minimal influence. Active head monomers pull and straighten chains (activity-induced stiffening), while active tail monomers push and cause crumpling, leading to faster backbone decorrelation. Hydrodynamics can tune flow fields but doesn't change core effects.

Conclusion: The position of active force application significantly impacts polymer dynamics through different mechanical responses (pulling vs pushing), with these effects being robust to hydrodynamic interactions, though hydrodynamics allows tuning of flow field characteristics.

Abstract: We employ mesoscopic simulations to study active polymers in a solvent via
multi-particle collision dynamics. We investigate linear chains in which either
the head or tail monomer exerts an active force, directed away from or towards
its neighbor, respectively, while the remaining monomers are passive. We find
that, in contrast to flexible chains, for stiff chains the position of the
active monomer has minimal influence on both the structural and dynamic
properties of the chain. An active head monomer pulls the chain behind it,
straightening the backbone -- an effect that can be interpreted as
activity-induced stiffening. In contrast, an active tail pushes into the chain,
causing crumpling. This leads to faster decorrelation of the polymer backbone
over time, rendering the active motion less persistent. These effects occur
regardless of whether hydrodynamic interactions are included or not.
Hydrodynamics is included by the imposition of a local counter-force in the
surrounding fluid, as opposed to distributing the former equally to all fluid
elements. By specifying the position of this counterforce onto the fluid, we
can tune the hydrodynamic flow fields of the active polymers being both
contractile and extensile. Interestingly, the emerging pusher- and puller flow
fields are strongly influenced by the force propagation inside the polymer
chain.

TL;DR: GNNs can extrapolate beyond training data to generate numerical schemes, rediscovering finite volume methods for heat equation through symbolic regression and unsupervised PINN-like training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that GNNs can go beyond approximation and actively contribute to developing novel numerical methods by generating numerical schemes, particularly addressing their extrapolation capabilities beyond training domains.

Method: Train GNNs on simple two-node graphs, use symbolic regression to extract learned schemes, and employ unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) loss without ground-truth data to recover finite volume schemes.

Result: GNNs successfully rediscovered first-order and second-order finite volume schemes for heat equation, including standard first-order FV scheme and second-order midpoint scheme, with error bounds proportional to training loss.

Conclusion: GNNs are not just approximators but can actively contribute to numerical method development, establishing a new paradigm where neural networks generate rather than just approximate numerical schemes.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

TL;DR: Neural networks can exactly emulate any computational circuit using ReLU activations, demonstrating that no reasoning task is beyond their reach when perfectly trained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify what forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation problems.

Method: A meta-algorithm that converts any circuit into a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator.

Result: Exact emulation of circuits without approximation, including Boolean gates, tropical circuits, arithmetic gates, and hybrids. Applications include shortest-path algorithms, Turing machine simulation, and randomized Boolean circuits.

Conclusion: Neural networks can perform any reasoning task defined by circuits, trading algorithmic runtime for space complexity, and this result is more powerful than classical universal approximation theorems.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

TL;DR: A low-cost method for accurate superconducting critical temperature prediction using coarse grid calculations with density of states rescaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard first principles methods require dense Brillouin zone grids for accurate Tc prediction, creating computational bottlenecks that hinder high-throughput screening for high-temperature superconductors.

Method: Calculate electron-phonon spectral function on coarse grids and rescale it to correct for inaccurate density of states values at Fermi energy on coarser grids.

Result: The method converges rapidly and improves accuracy for systems with sharp features in density of states compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: This approach enables rapid identification of promising superconducting candidates and can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows.

Abstract: First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting
critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through
the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity
requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a
bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In
this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low
cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided
the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of
states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches,
the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for
systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be
directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the
rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be
overlooked.

Motivation: To better understand nuclear matter properties, neutron star equation of state, and mass-radius relations using an improved AdS/QCD approach that treats baryons as solitonic configurations.

Method: Employed a hard-wall AdS/QCD model with a different homogeneous approximation that incorporates equations of motion for pure gauge fields, treating baryons as solitonic configurations in gauge fields.

Result: Achieved chiral phase transition within baryonic phase, found speed of sound converges to conformal limit at high densities, obtained more tightly constrained equation of state, and produced mass-radius relations consistent with current neutron star observations.

Conclusion: The model successfully describes chiral symmetry restoration and pseudoconformal structure in compact star matter, providing improved constraints on neutron star properties that align with observational data.

Abstract: We investigate properties of nuclear matter, equation of state (EOS) of
neutron stars and its mass-radius relation in a hard-wall AdS/QCD model by
regarding baryons as solitonic configurations in gauge fields. Compared with
previous approaches, we employ a different homogeneous approximation that takes
into account the equations of motion for the pure gauge fields. By choosing
appropriate parameters, we realize a chiral phase transition within the
baryonic phase, where the chiral condensate decreases with the baryon chemical
potential, until it reaches zero -- chiral symmetry is restored. In addition,
independent of the existence of chiral phase transition, we also find that the
speed of sound converges to the conformal limit at the density relevant to
cores of massive stars but the trace of energy-momentum tensor does not vanish
which indicates the pseudoconformal structure and intrinsic manifestation of
scale symmetry in compact star matter. Through calculations, we obtain an
equation of state that is more tightly constrained than previous works, and the
resulting mass-radius relation of neutron stars is consistent with current
observations.

TL;DR: Fe atoms are more mobile than Ni atoms in Fe-Ni alloys due to spin-polarized electronic structure effects that cause Fe to relax into vacancies while Ni remains rigid.

Motivation: To understand the atomic-scale mechanisms behind the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys, particularly for rare-earth-free magnet applications.

Method: Used ab initio electronic structure calculations with nudged elastic band (NEB) method to quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration in both disordered fcc and ordered L1₀ phases of FeₓNi₁₋ₓ alloys (0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6).

Result: Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Found coupling between local lattice distortions and local electronic spin polarization around vacancies - Fe atoms relax into vacancies while Ni atoms remain fixed to original positions.

Conclusion: The reduced mobility of Ni compared to Fe is determined by spin-polarized electronic structure effects that influence atomic relaxation behavior around vacancies, providing atomic-scale insight into slow Ni diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.

Abstract: The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x
\textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the
framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged
elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice
vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as
the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under
consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced
engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB
calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of
compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered
structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile
than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of
the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure.
Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice
distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around
vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms
remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a
key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe
atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding
experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in
Fe-Ni alloys.
