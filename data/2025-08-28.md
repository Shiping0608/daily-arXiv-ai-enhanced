### [1] [Neural operators for solving nonlinear inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19347)
*Otmar Scherzer,Thi Lan Nhi Vu,Jikai Yan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of Tikhonov regularization using neural operators for solving ill-posed operator equations, with extensions to Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces and network structure optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve infinite dimensional operator equations where operators are specified indirectly through input-output training pairs rather than physical laws, requiring robust regularization methods for ill-posed problems.

Method: Tikhonov regularization with neural operators as surrogates, balancing approximation errors, regularization parameters, and noise. Extends neural operator approximation properties to Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces.

Result: Provides analytical framework for solving ill-posed operator equations using neural operators, with extended approximation capabilities beyond continuous functions to more general function spaces.

Conclusion: Neural operators combined with Tikhonov regularization offer an effective approach for solving inverse problems involving indirectly specified operators, with proper network structure being crucial for success.

Abstract: We consider solving a probably infinite dimensional operator equation, where
the operator is not modeled by physical laws but is specified indirectly via
training pairs of the input-output relation of the operator. Neural operators
have proven to be efficient to approximate operators with such information. In
this paper, we analyze Tikhonov regularization with neural operators as
surrogates for solving ill-posed operator equations. The analysis is based on
balancing approximation errors of neural operators, regularization parameters,
and noise. Moreover, we extend the approximation properties of neural operators
from sets of continuous functions to Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces, which is
crucial for solving inverse problems. Finally, we address the problem of
finding an appropriate network structure of neural operators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensor networks provide compact representations of high-dimensional data, but there's a need for efficient methods to reduce bond dimensions through gauge freedom exploitation to enable more scalable computations in quantum physics, PDEs, and machine learning.

Method: Formulates tensor disentangling as optimization over orthogonal matrices to minimize matricized rank. Uses Riemannian optimization and a joint optimization framework alternating between optimizing orthogonal transformations and low-rank approximations. Introduces binary search strategy for optimal rank discovery.

Result: Numerical experiments on random tensors and approximate isometric tensor network states show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization methods and the potential for hybrid approaches combining different methods.

Conclusion: The presented optimization framework provides competitive alternatives for tensor disentangling, with the binary search strategy effectively handling unknown optimal rank scenarios, offering practical solutions for reducing bond dimensions in tensor networks.

Abstract: Tensor networks provide compact and scalable representations of
high-dimensional data, enabling efficient computation in fields such as quantum
physics, numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning.
This paper focuses on tensor disentangling, the task of identifying
transformations that reduce bond dimensions by exploiting gauge freedom in the
network. We formulate this task as an optimization problem over orthogonal
matrices acting on a single tensor's indices, aiming to minimize the rank of
its matricized form. We present Riemannian optimization methods and a joint
optimization framework that alternates between optimizing the orthogonal
transformation for a fixed low-rank approximation and optimizing the low-rank
approximation for a fixed orthogonal transformation, offering a competitive
alternative when the target rank is known. To seek the often unknown optimal
rank, we introduce a binary search strategy integrated with the disentangling
procedure. Numerical experiments on random tensors and tensors in an
approximate isometric tensor network state are performed to compare different
optimization methods and explore the possibility of combining different methods
in a hybrid approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Energy-Equidistributed adaptive sampling
framework for multi-dimensional conservative PDEs, introducing both
location-based and velocity-based formulations of Energy-Equidistributed moving

Motivation: The Lane-Emden equation frequently arises in astrophysics and nonlinear models but presents challenges due to singularity at one endpoint, requiring robust numerical methods.

Method: Established existence/uniqueness of solution, proposed continuous iterative method, discretized using trapezoidal quadrature with correction terms, derived three discrete iterative schemes for specific cases.

Result: Methods achieve eighth-order accuracy and convergence, numerical experiments validate theoretical findings and demonstrate superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: Efficient tools for solving Lane-Emden boundary value problems that can be extended to higher-order nonlinear singular models like Emden-Fowler equations.

Abstract: This paper presents high-order numerical methods for solving boundary value
problems associated with the Lane-Emden equation, which frequently arises in
astrophysics and various nonlinear models. A major challenge in studying this
equation lies in its singularity at one endpoint. Prior to constructing the
numerical methods, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution
and propose a continuous iterative method. This continuous method is then
discretized using the trapezoidal quadrature rule enhanced with correction
terms. As a result, we derive three discrete iterative schemes tailored for
three specific cases of the Lane-Emden equation. We rigorously prove that the
proposed methods achieve eighth-order accuracy and convergence. A series of
numerical experiments is conducted to validate the theoretical findings and
demonstrate the accuracy and convergence order of the proposed schemes, which
outperform existing methods. These schemes thus provide efficient tools for
solving Lane-Emden boundary value problems and can be readily extended to
higher-order nonlinear singular models, such as Emden-Fowler equations, which
arise in many applications.

### [10] [Dominant H-Eigenvectors of Tensor Kronecker Products Do Not Decouple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19902)
*Ayush Kulkarni,Charles Colley,David F. Gleich*

TL;DR: Counterexample showing Kronecker product of tensors' dominant H-eigenvector doesn't decouple like matrices/Z-eigenvectors, with H-eigenvalues exceeding component products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address an open question about whether the dominant H-eigenvector of a Kronecker product of tensors decouples into a product of eigenvectors like in matrices and Z-eigenvector cases.

Method: Constructed a counterexample demonstrating that for H-eigenvectors, the dominant eigenvector of a Kronecker product does not decouple into individual tensor eigenvectors.

Result: Showed that the largest H-eigenvalue can actually exceed the product of the H-eigenvalues of the component tensors, contrary to matrix and Z-eigenvector behavior.

Conclusion: H-eigenvectors behave fundamentally differently from matrices and Z-eigenvectors in Kronecker products, with non-decoupling properties and potential eigenvalue amplification.

Abstract: We illustrate a counterexample to an open question related to the dominant
H-eigenvector of a Kronecker product of tensors. For matrices and
Z-eigenvectors of tensors, the dominant eigenvector of a Kronecker product
decouples into a product of eigenvectors of the tensors underlying the
Kronecker product. This does not occur for H-eigenvectors and indeed, the
largest H-eigenvalue can exceed the product of the H-eigenvalues of the
component tensors.

### [11] [Performance evaluation of high-order compact and second-order gas-kinetic schemes in compressible flow simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19911)
*Yaqing Yang,Fengxiang Zhao,Kun Xu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Fifth-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS-5th) achieves comparable resolution to second-order scheme at 10x lower computational cost, with superior accuracy in turbulent flows with shocks and vortices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and computational cost in complex flow simulations; need to evaluate practical performance of high-order schemes for scale-resolving simulations.

Method: Comparative evaluation of fifth-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS-5th) vs conventional second-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS-2nd) across subsonic to supersonic test cases; implemented multi-GPU parallelization with CUDA and MPI.

Result: CGKS-5th achieves similar resolution as GKS-2nd at approximately 10x lower computational cost; delivers significantly higher accuracy and resolution under equivalent computational resources, especially for turbulent flows with shocks and small-scale vortices.

Conclusion: First clear verification of high-order compact gas-kinetic schemes' advantages for viscous flows with discontinuities; demonstrates superior computational efficiency and accuracy for complex flow simulations.

Abstract: The trade-off among accuracy, robustness, and computational cost remains a
key challenge in simulating complex flows. Second-order schemes are
computationally efficient but lack the accuracy required for resolving
intricate flow structures, particularly in turbulence. High-order schemes,
especially compact high-order schemes, offer superior accuracy and resolution
at a relatively modest computational cost. To clarify the practical performance
of high-order schemes in scale-resolving simulations, this study evaluates two
representative gas-kinetic schemes: the newly developed fifth-order compact
gas-kinetic scheme (CGKS-5th) and the conventional second-order gas-kinetic
scheme (GKS-2nd). Test cases ranging from subsonic to supersonic flows are used
to quantitatively assess their accuracy and efficiency. The results demonstrate
that CGKS-5th achieves comparable resolution to GKS-2nd at roughly an order of
magnitude lower computational cost. Under equivalent computational resources,
CGKS-5th delivers significantly higher accuracy and resolution, particularly in
turbulent flows involving shocks and small-scale vortices. This study provides
the first clear verification of the advantages of high-order compact
gas-kinetic schemes in simulating viscous flows with discontinuities.
Additionally, multi-GPU parallelization using CUDA and MPI is implemented to
enable large-scale applications.

*Bingyin Zhang,Hongfei Fu,Hong Wag*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: High-order linear stabilized schemes for time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation that preserve energy stability and maximum-bound principle using novel prediction strategy and auxiliary functional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop nonuniform time-stepping schemes that can simultaneously preserve both discrete energy stability and maximum-bound principle for the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation, which is challenging due to the nonlinear potential.

Method: Developed a new prediction strategy for second-order MBP-preserving predicted solution, introduced nonnegative auxiliary functional for stabilization term design, and proposed L1 and L2-1_œÉ schemes with improved versions using unbalanced stabilization terms.

Result: L1 scheme unconditionally preserves discrete MBP, L2-1_œÉ scheme requires mild time-step restriction, and improved L2-1_œÉ scheme enhances MBP preservation for large time steps. Numerical examples validate accuracy and physics-preserving properties.

Conclusion: The proposed linear stabilized schemes successfully achieve both energy stability and maximum-bound principle preservation for time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation through innovative prediction strategies and stabilization techniques, demonstrating effectiveness in maintaining physical properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of nonuniform time-stepping, high-order
linear stabilized schemes that can preserve both the discrete energy stability
and maximum-bound principle (MBP) for the time-fractional Allen-Cahn equation.
To this end, we develop a new prediction strategy to obtain a second-order and
MBP-preserving predicted solution, which is then used to handle the nonlinear
potential explicitly. Additionally, we introduce an essential nonnegative
auxiliary functional that enables the design of an appropriate stabilization
term to dominate the predicted nonlinear potential, and thus to preserve the
discrete MBP. Combining the newly developed prediction strategy and auxiliary
functional, we propose two unconditionally energy-stable linear stabilized
schemes, L1 and L2-$1_\sigma$ schemes. We show that the L1 scheme
unconditionally preserves the discrete MBP, whereas the L2-$1_\sigma$ scheme
requires a mild time-step restriction. Furthermore, we develop an improved
L2-$1_\sigma$ scheme with enhanced MBP preservation for large time steps,
achieved through a novel unbalanced stabilization term that leverages the
boundedness and monotonicity of the auxiliary functional. Representative
numerical examples validate the accuracy, effectiveness, and physics-preserving
of the proposed methods.

Method: Extends Lim-≈Ωubriniƒá's operator-asymptotic approach to 3D linearized elasticity, employs Bloch approximation for vector-valued functions with compact Fourier support

Result: Achieves error of order Œµ^{n+1} in L^2 and Œµ^n in H^1 norms for any n, significantly improving convergence rates

Conclusion: The extended operator-asymptotic approach with Bloch approximation provides superior convergence rates in homogenization of periodic elastic composites

Abstract: The operator-asymptotic approach was introduced by Lim-\v{Z}ubrini\'c in

consider the setting of three-dimensional linearized elasticity, and extend the
approach to obtain higher-order convergence rates. In particular, we consider
the so-called ``Bloch approximation'' for vector-valued functions with compact
Fourier support, and demonstrate that under such data, the approach provides an
expansion that yields an error of order $\varepsilon^{n+1}$ in $L^2$ and
$\varepsilon^n$ in $H^1$, for any $n$.

in $d=2$, we obtain sharp bounds for the Schatten exponent (summability index)
$\beta\in [2, \infty]$ when $d\ge4$, and $\beta\in[1, 2]$ when $d=2$, improving
upon the previous estimates due to Kinoshita--Ko--Shiraki. Our approach is
based on a novel analysis of a key integral arising in the case $\beta=2$,
which allows us to refine existing techniques and achieve the optimal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish regularity of weak solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which is a fundamental open problem in fluid dynamics

Method: Construct a supercritical space with inverse logarithmic weight in frequency domain, obtain energy estimates for high frequency parts, and use re-scaling argument to estimate critical norms

Result: Proved that any Leray-Hopf weak solution with H^1/2 initial data is regular and belongs to L^1(0,1; H^1/2(R^3))

Conclusion: The paper provides a new approach to prove regularity for 3D Navier-Stokes equations using supercritical spaces and re-scaling techniques

Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to 3D Navier-Stokes equations with
initial values u0 2 H1=2(R3) belong to L1(0; 1; H1=2(R3)) and thus it is
regular. For the proof, flrst, we construct a supercritical space, the norm of
which is compared to the homogeneous Sobolev H_ 1=2-norm in that it has inverse
logarithmic weight very sparsely in the frequency domain. Then we obtain the
energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the
supercritical norm on the right-hand side. Finally, we superpose the energy
norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical
norms of the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Harnack inequalities beyond the usual forward-in-time versions and remove restrictions like boundedness or vanishing boundary conditions that limit applicability.

Method: Based on Hamilton's gradient estimates for the heat equation, the authors develop a backward-in-time Harnack inequality that works on compact manifolds without additional solution constraints.

TL;DR: Unconditional uniqueness for 5th order KP equations using energy estimates and X^{s,b} methods with L^4 Strichartz estimates


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study the 5th order Kadomstev-Petviashvili equations on the real line to establish unconditional uniqueness of solutions

Method: Adapt energy estimate argument from previous work, apply short-time X^{s,b} methods, use multilinear interpolation to access L^4 Strichartz estimates for improved derivative gain

Result: Achieved unconditional uniqueness with regularity arbitrarily close to L^2, which is almost sharp in the context of unconditional uniqueness results

Conclusion: The combined approach of energy estimates, X^{s,b} methods, and L^4 Strichartz estimates provides an effective framework for proving unconditional uniqueness for 5th order KP equations

Abstract: In this paper we study the $5$th Order Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) equations
posed on the real line. In particular we adapt the energy estimate argument
from Guo-Molinet (arXiv:2404.12364v1 [math.AP]) to conclude unconditional
uniqueness of the solution to data map for $5$th order KP type equations.
Applying short-time $X^{s,b}$ methods to improve classical energy estimates
provides more than sufficient decay when considering estimates on the interior
of the time interval $[0,T]$. The issue is how we deal with the boundary. By
abusing symmetry we can apply multilinear interpolation to gain access to $L^4$
Strichartz estimates, which provide improved derivative gain. When taken
together, the regularity of our resultant function space can be arbitrarily
close to $L^2$, which in the context of unconditional uniqueness results is
almost sharp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex problem of accretive growth in viscoelastic solids at large strains, where material accumulates at boundaries in unstressed states and growth is deformation-driven, requiring proper modeling of incompatible strain buildup.

Method: Revisits an existing model, incorporates additional backstrain to model progressive incompatible strain buildup, and regularizes the model using a fictitious compliant material surrounding the accreting body.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of solutions to the coupled accretion and viscoelastic equilibrium problem, providing mathematical validation for the proposed modeling approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses accretive growth in viscoelastic solids by incorporating backstrain modeling and regularization techniques, establishing existence proofs for the coupled mechanical problem.

Abstract: By revisiting a model proposed in [45], we address the accretive growth of a
viscoelastic solid at large strains. The accreted material is assumed to
accumulate at the boundary of the body in an unstressed state. The growth
process is driven by the deformation state of the solid. The progressive
build-up of incompatible strains in the material is modeled by considering an
additional backstrain. The model is regularized by postulating the presence of
a fictitious compliant material surrounding the accreting body. We show the
existence of solutions to the coupled accretion and viscoelastic equilibrium
problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend and deepen the understanding of a recent inequality variant introduced by Chang and Gui on the 2-sphere, particularly focusing on the characterization of extremal functions and stability properties.

Method: Exploited the conformal invariance property of the associated functional to characterize all extremal solutions in terms of conformal maps of the 2-sphere, and established a sharp quantitative stability result in the gradient norm.

Result: Confirmed that the inequality holds for Œ±‚â•2/3, with trivial extremals for Œ±>2/3 and nontrivial extremals at the critical value Œ±=2/3. Provided complete characterization of extremals using conformal maps and proved sharp quantitative stability.

Conclusion: The conformal invariance property provides a powerful tool for understanding extremal functions and stability properties of this inequality variant, leading to a complete classification and sharp quantitative results.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a recent variant of the Trudinger-Moser-Onofri
inequality introduced by S. Y. Alice Chang and Changfeng Gui \cite{CG-2023}:
\begin{align*} \alpha\int_{\mathbb{S}^2}|\nabla_{\mathbb{S}^2}u|^2 {\rm
d}\omega+2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} u {\rm d}\omega
-\frac{1}{2}\ln\left[\left(\int_{\mathbb{s}^2}e^{2u}{\rm
d}\omega\right)^2-\sum_{i=1}^3\left(\int_{\mathbb{s}^2}\omega_i e^{2u}{\rm d}
\omega\right)^2\right] \geq 0 \end{align*} holds on $H^1(\mathbb{S}^2)$ if and
only if $\alpha \geq \frac{2}{3}$. In this regime, the infimum is attained only
by trivial functions when $\alpha > \frac{2}{3},$ whereas for the critical
value $\alpha = \frac{2}{3}$ nontrivial extremals exist, and Chang-Gui further
provided a complete classification of such solutions.
  Building upon their result, we found a nice conformal invariance of the
associated functional. Exploiting this invariance, we were able to characterize
the full family of extremals in terms of conformal maps of $\mathbb{S}^2$ and,
moreover, establish a sharp quantitative stability result in the gradient norm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand tumor growth dynamics under periodic nutrient supply and investigate stability conditions and symmetry-breaking periodic solutions in free boundary tumor models.

Method: Mathematical analysis of a simplified tumor model with three parameters, studying flat solutions, stability classification, and periodic bifurcations from flat periodic solutions using periodicity and symmetry arguments.

Result: Complete classification of stability conditions: zero flat solution is globally stable when threshold concentration ‚â• mean external nutrients; otherwise, unique positive periodic flat solution exists as global attractor. First demonstration of periodic bifurcations in free boundary tumor problems.

Conclusion: The model provides fundamental insights into tumor growth under periodic nutrient conditions, establishing stability criteria and revealing rich periodic solution structures through symmetry-breaking bifurcations.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a free boundary multi-layer tumor model that
incorporates a $T-$periodic provision of external nutrients $\Phi(t)$. The
simplified model contains three parameters: the mean of periodic external
nutrients $\Phi(t)$, the threshold concentration $\widetilde{\sigma}$ for
proliferation and the cell to cell adhesiveness coefficient $\gamma$. We first
study the flat solution and give a complete classification about $\frac{1}{T}
\int_0^T \Phi(t) d t$ and $\widetilde{\sigma}$ according to global stability of
zero equilibrium solution or global stability of the positive periodic
solution. Precisely, (i) a zero flat solution is globally stable under the flat
perturbations if and only if $\widetilde{\sigma} \geqslant \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T
\Phi(t) d t$; (ii) If $\widetilde{\sigma}<\frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \Phi(t) d t$,
then there exists a unique positive flat solution $\left(\sigma_*(y, t), p_*(y,
t), { \rho_*(t)}\right)$ with period $T$ and it is a global attractor of all
positive flat solutions for all $\gamma>0$. We further investigate periodic
solutions bifurcating from the flat periodic solution $\left(\sigma_*(y, t),
p_*(y, t), { \rho_*(t)}\right)$. By periodicity and symmetry, we not only give
symmetry-breaking periodic solutions for all positive parameter $\gamma_j$, but
also show the existence of a plethora of periodic bifurcations. For the free
boundary tumor problem, this is the first result of the existence of periodic
bifurcations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FEP requires accurate protein-ligand complex structures, limiting its use in early drug discovery where experimental structures are unavailable. Structure prediction models like Boltz-2 could overcome this limitation.

Method: Combined Boltz-2 structure prediction with absolute FEP protocol to create Boltz-ABFE pipeline. Investigated predicted structure quality and developed automated approaches to improve structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on four protein targets from FEP+ benchmark set. Showed feasibility of absolute FEP simulations without experimental crystal structures.

Conclusion: Boltz-ABFE significantly expands FEP's applicability domain, enabling accurate structure-based affinity estimation in early-stage drug discovery without experimental structures.

Abstract: Free energy perturbation (FEP) is considered the gold-standard simulation
method for estimating small molecule binding affinity, a quantity of vital
importance to drug discovery. The accuracy of FEP critically depends on an
accurate model of the protein-ligand complex as an initial condition for the
underlying molecular dynamics simulation. This requirement has limited the
impact of FEP in earlier stages of the discovery process, where appropriate
experimental crystal structures are rarely available. The latest generation of
structure prediction models, such as Boltz-2, promise to overcome this
limitation by predicting protein-ligand complex structures. In this work, we
combine Boltz-2 with our own absolute FEP protocol to build Boltz-ABFE, a
robust pipeline for estimating the absolute binding free energies (ABFE) in the
absence of experimental crystal structures. We investigate the quality of the
structures predicted by Boltz-2, propose automated approaches to improve
structures for use in molecular dynamics simulations, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the Boltz-ABFE pipeline for four protein targets from the FEP+
benchmark set. Demonstrating the feasibility of absolute FEP simulations
without experimental crystal structures, Boltz-ABFE significantly expands the
domain of applicability of FEP, paving the way towards accelerated early-stage
drug discovery via accurate, structure-based affinity estimation.

TL;DR: Chiral molecular systems exhibit current-induced spin polarization above critical current thresholds through dynamic symmetry breaking, not inherent chirality effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve whether geometric chirality inherently induces spin polarization or simply modulates spin transport in chiral molecular systems.

Method: Employed ab initio real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to directly simulate charge current, spin, and orbital interplay beyond perturbative treatments.

Result: Above critical current threshold, time-reversal symmetry constraints are dynamically lifted, producing pronounced spin and orbital polarizations despite symmetric Hamiltonian. Spin/orbital angular momenta dynamics correlate with loss of translational momentum.

Conclusion: Current-driven symmetry lowering in chiral systems causes redistribution of angular degrees of freedom, with implications for chirality-induced spin selectivity and spintronic device design.

Abstract: The spin dynamics of electrons in chiral molecular systems remains a topic of
intense interest, particularly regarding whether geometric chirality inherently
induces spin polarization or simply modulates spin transport. In this work, we
employ ab initio real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT)
to directly simulate the interplay between charge current, spin, and orbital.
This real-time tracking goes beyond perturbative treatments, and we analyze how
nonequilibrium currents effectively lift the symmetry constraints of
screw-rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We find that above a critical
current threshold, time-reversal symmetry constraints are dynamically lifted --
leading to pronounced spin and orbital polarizations, even when the underlying
Hamiltonian remains symmetric. Notably, the emergence of spin and orbital
angular momenta dynamics correlates with a loss of translational (linear)
momentum, suggesting a redistribution of angular degrees of freedom as an
intrinsic consequence of a current-driven symmetry lowering in a chiral system,
with implications for chirality-induced spin selectivity and spintronic device
design.

Result: Neural networks successfully mastered brachistochrone and quantum harmonic oscillator problems, with a derived unified generalization theory showing a threshold network size requirement.

Conclusion: The variational principle is the governing mechanism for artificial physical intuitions, offering insights into how both humans and AI can formulate strong physical understanding.

Abstract: Physical intuitions are native functions from human brains, yet the
understanding of how physical intuitions are formulated has remained elusive.
In this Letter, we propose a mechanism that simulates how human brain can
quickly develop intuitional understandings from limited observations.
Conceiving a training algorithm adapted from the well-known variational
principle in physics, small artificial neural networks can possess strong
physical intuitions that master the problems of brachistochrone and quantum
harmonic oscillators, by learning from a few highly similar samples. Our
simulations suggest that the variational principle is the governing mechanism
for artificial physical intuitions. A unified generalization theory is derived,
which hinges upon a variational operation on the Euler-Lagrange equation. Our
theory also rationalizes that there is a threshold of artificial neural network
size below which satisfactory physical intuitions are not possible. Our work
offers insights into how strong physical intuition can be formulated as humans
or as artificial intelligences.

TL;DR: Electric field-enhanced solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system improves thrust density while maintaining efficiency by using auxiliary electrodes that induce ionization without discharging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous decoupled thrusters were found infeasible due to electric field line constraints when ignoring diffusion effects, requiring improved driving methods for additional electrodes.

Method: Proposed using auxiliary electrodes that don't discharge but induce ionization and attachment, creating an electric field-enhanced system. Validated through numerical simulations.

Result: The new concept demonstrated improved thrust density while maintaining the thrust-to-power ratio compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: Electric field-enhanced solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion represents a feasible improvement over decoupled thrusters, offering better performance without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: A solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system applies a high electric
potential difference between two electrodes to ionize air within the resulting
electric field, accelerating the ions to generate thrust. Previously, the
so-called ``decoupled thrusters'' have been proposed, in which ion generation
and acceleration are spatially decoupled. Here, we argue that such decoupling
is infeasible from the perspective of electric field lines if the diffusion
effects are ignored, and consequently the driving method (e.g., dielectric
barrier discharge) for the additional electrodes can be improved. Specifically,
the use of auxiliary electrodes that do not discharge but induce ionization and
attachment can be appropriate. This concept was named the electric
field-enhanced solid-state electro-aerodynamic propulsion system. Furthermore,
through numerical simulations, this concept showed improvement in thrust
density while maintaining the thrust-to-power ratio.

Motivation: To investigate the transitional characteristics of blue-core helicon discharge, which has not been particularly focused on before, using advanced diagnostics and simulations to understand the underlying physics.

Method: Used Multiple Plasma Simulation Linear Device (MPS-LD) with Langmuir probe, optical emission spectrometer, high-speed camera, and electromagnetic solver based on Maxwell's equations and cold-plasma dielectric tensor to measure parameters and compute wave fields.

Result: Found opposite jump directions for electron density (increases) and temperature (decreases), localized radial density profile near axis, W-shaped temperature profile, pressure-dependent behavior, radial oscillations with azimuthal instabilities, and significant wave field changes during transition.

Conclusion: This work provides comprehensive characteristics of transitional blue-core discharge that are important for both physics understanding and practical applications, revealing detailed transitional behaviors not previously available.

Abstract: This study explores the transitional characteristics of blue-core helicon
discharge, which to our knowledge was not particularly focused on before.
Parameters are measured on recently built advanced linear plasma device, i.e.
Multiple Plasma Simulation Linear Device (MPS-LD) by various diagnostics
including Langmuir probe, optical emission spectrometer, and standard
high-speed camera. It is found that the jump direction of electron density
(from low level to high level) is opposite to that of electron temperature
(from high level to low level). Electron density increases significantly and
the radial profile becomes localized near the axis when the blue-core
transition occurs. With increased field strength, electron density increases
whereas electron temperature drops. The radial profile of electron temperature
looks like a ``W" shape, i.e. minimizing around the edge of blue-core column.
Electron density increases with background pressure, while electron temperature
peaks around certain pressure value. High-speed videos show that the plasma
column oscillates radially and experiences azimuthal instabilities with high
rate once entered blue-core mode. An electromagnetic solver (EMS) based on
Maxwell's equations and a cold-plasma dielectric tensor is also employed to
compute the wave field and power absorption during blue-core transition, to
provide more details that are valuable for understanding the transitional
physics but not yet available in experiment. The results show that wave field
in both radial and axial directions changes significantly during the
transition, its structure differs from antenna to downstream, and the power
dependence of wave magnetic field is overall opposite to that of wave electric
field. This work presents comprehensive characteristics of the transitional
blue-core discharge and is important to both physics understanding and
practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the nonphysical cluster formation in hydrogen plasma simulations at temperatures below 50 kK reported by Filinov (2004), by developing an improved semiclassical approach that accounts for finite electron size.

Method: Semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation using an improved Kelbg pseudopotential that incorporates finite electron size effects. The method also utilizes angular-averaged Ewald potential for long-range interactions and computes thermodynamic limits.

Result: The modified approach successfully resolves the nonphysical cluster formation problem at temperatures below 50 kK. However, energy is still underestimated at low temperatures compared to path integral Monte Carlo results. The study provides analysis of radial distribution functions, composition, ionization degree, energy, and pressure dependencies on plasma coupling parameter.

Conclusion: Accounting for finite electron size in the Kelbg pseudopotential eliminates nonphysical cluster formation in hydrogen plasma simulations, representing a significant improvement over previous methods, though energy underestimation at low temperatures remains an issue requiring further investigation.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation of
nondegenerate hydrogen plasma using an improved Kelbg pseudopotential. The main
novelty of our method is accounting for the finite size of electrons. This
modification resolves the nonphysical cluster formation at temperatures below
50 kK, which was first reported by A.V. Filinov [Phys. Rev. E 70, 046411
(2004)]. However, the energy still appears to be underestimated at low
temperatures, as indicated by comparisons with the recent path integral Monte
Carlo calculations [Phys. Plasmas 31, 110501 (2024)]. Using the presented
method, we analyze the dependence of radial distribution functions,
composition, ionization degree, energy, and pressure on the plasma coupling
parameter, while maintaining a fixed degeneracy parameter. Additionally, we
demonstrate the impact of incorporating long-range interactions on the energy
$N$-dependence by utilizing the angular-averaged Ewald potential. Finally, we
compute the thermodynamic limits for energy and pressure.

Conclusion: Provides versatile platform for tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and offers experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material

be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied

TL;DR: Implementation and analysis of Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method for solving stellar oscillation equations with realistic solar gravity and rotation, focusing on stabilization requirements for accurate numerical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve local helioseismology techniques by developing robust numerical methods for modeling solar oscillations with realistic gravitational and rotational effects, which are essential for accurate imaging and inversion of the Sun's interior dynamics.

Method: Used Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve stellar oscillation equations derived from an equivalent variant of Galbrun's equation, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. The system was solved under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption using azimuthal decomposition.

Result: The method successfully handled the mathematical challenges posed by solar buoyancy frequency profiles, with numerical power spectra accurately reproducing observed effects of solar rotation on acoustic waves. Stabilization was shown to be crucial for solution accuracy, depending on frequencies relative to buoyancy frequency and Dirac source position.

Conclusion: The HDG method is robust for solving stellar oscillation equations with realistic solar backgrounds, but requires careful stabilization choices to handle the mixed elliptic/hyperbolic nature of the wave operator influenced by gravity effects through the buoyancy frequency profile.

Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed
to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of
oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar
oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and
investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic
solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common
choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working
equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in
its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure
perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric
assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG
method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the
wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N
which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or
hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small
attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness,
the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and
oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We
investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate
its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to
depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source.

*Zongyu Wu,Ruichen Xu,Luoyao Chen,Georgios Kementzidis,Siyao Wang,Yuefan Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAR-HNN replaces MLPs with univariate transformations in Hamiltonian Neural Networks to reduce energy drift and improve stability while maintaining physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HNN implementations using MLPs cause hypersensitivity to hyperparameters and struggle with complex energy landscapes, leading to energy drift and poor long-term stability.

Method: Proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural Network that uses localized univariate transformations instead of MLPs to better capture high-frequency and multi-scale dynamics while preserving symplectic structure.

Result: Tested on four benchmark problems (spring-mass, simple pendulum, two- and three-body problems), showing reduced energy drift and improved long-term predictive stability compared to MLP-based HNNs.

Conclusion: KAR-HNN is effective for accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes, especially in high dimensions with few known parameters, due to its improved energy conservation and stability properties.

Abstract: We propose a Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural
Network (KAR-HNN) that replaces the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with
univariate transformations. While Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) ensure
energy conservation by learning Hamiltonian functions directly from data,
existing implementations, often relying on MLPs, cause hypersensitivity to the
hyperparameters while exploring complex energy landscapes. Our approach
exploits the localized function approximations to better capture high-frequency
and multi-scale dynamics, reducing energy drift and improving long-term
predictive stability. The networks preserve the symplectic form of Hamiltonian
systems, and thus maintain interpretability and physical consistency. After
assessing KAR-HNN on four benchmark problems including spring-mass, simple
pendulum, two- and three-body problem, we foresee its effectiveness for
accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes often at high
dimensions and with few known parameters.

Motivation: To provide theoretical foundations for rational function and rational neural network approximations, particularly relevant for symbolic regression in physical law learning applications.

Method: The authors develop approximation theory for rational functions and rational neural networks in the C¬π-norm, analyzing approximation rates with respect to network architecture parameters (width, depth) and rational function degree.

Result: The paper establishes that suitably regular functions can be effectively approximated in the C¬π-norm by both rational functions and rational neural networks, with specific approximation rates. The results extend to architectures like EQL√∑ and ParFam that are important for symbolic regression.

Conclusion: The theoretical results provide rigorous mathematical support for using rational approximations and rational neural networks in applications requiring C¬π-approximation, particularly in symbolic regression for learning physical laws through architectures like EQL√∑ and ParFam.

Abstract: We show that suitably regular functions can be approximated in the

TL;DR: Depth maps of 3D opaque scenes are encoded in imaging optics response functions, creating nonlinear depth-dependent images through engineered spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that imaging optics can directly encode 3D depth information and leverage volume metaoptics for nonlinear sensing and processing of 3D scenes.

Method: Engineered strong spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics to create complex images that respond to depth maps, with the optics response function encoding 2D depth information.

Result: The optics creates images that depend nonlinearly on depth maps, and volume metaoptics can generate complex depth-dependent imagery through controlled dispersions.

Conclusion: Linear volume metaoptics can nonlinearly sense and process 3D opaque scenes through engineered spatio-spectral dispersions that encode depth information in the optical response.

Abstract: We showed that a 2D depth map representing an incoherent 3D opaque scene is
directly encoded in the response function of an imaging optics. As a result,
the optics creates an image that depends nonlinearly on the depth map.
Furthermore, strong spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics can be
engineered to create a complex image in response to a depth map. We hypothesize
that this complexity will allow the linear volume metaoptics to nonlinearly
sense and process 3D opaque scenes.

TL;DR: Using Fourier features as additional network inputs enables accurate modeling of highly oscillatory complex-valued functions in optical systems, achieving order-of-magnitude error reduction with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs struggle with learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions due to spectral bias, making them ineffective for modeling optical field perturbations.

Method: Incorporating Fourier features (predefined sinusoids dependent on perturbation) as additional network inputs to reframe the problem as finding linear combinations of basis functions.

Result: Achieved mean complex correlation of 0.995 with ground truth, reducing prediction error by an order of magnitude while using 85% fewer parameters compared to standard MLP.

Conclusion: This Fourier Feature Network approach provides a general and robust method for accurately modeling oscillatory physical systems, particularly effective for optical transmission matrix prediction.

Abstract: Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires
learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias,
preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we
incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the
perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning
problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination
of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature
Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under
mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces
prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of
magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth,
despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust
method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.

TL;DR: Analysis of quantum resource management challenges in NISQ era, proposing runtime-aware quantum software development with Qonscious framework prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NISQ quantum devices have severe limitations (limited qubits, high error rates, short coherence times) requiring efficient resource management for practical quantum algorithm deployment.

Method: Analyzed role of quantum resources in NISQ devices, proposed runtime-aware development approach, and created Qonscious prototype framework for conditional execution based on dynamic resource evaluation.

Result: Developed a proof-of-concept framework that enables resource-aware quantum programming, addressing key challenges like limited introspection and temporal constraints in current platforms.

Conclusion: This work strengthens Quantum Resource Estimation field and moves toward scalable, reliable, resource-aware quantum software development for practical NISQ applications.

Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological advancement in the way
information is processed by using the principles of quantum mechanics to solve
very complex problems that exceed the capabilities of classical systems.
However, in the current NISQ era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices),
the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number
of qubits, high error rates, and reduced coherence times. Efficient management
of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and
logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly
relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we
analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today,
identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused
on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum
software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as
limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current
platforms. As a proof of concept, we introduce Qonscious, a prototype framework
that enables conditional execution of quantum programs based on dynamic
resource evaluation. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of
Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move towards the development of scalable,
reliable, and resource-aware quantum software.

TL;DR: New Fourier-based LCHS formalism simplifies kernel construction, achieves 1.81x reduction in quantum differential equation algorithms and 8.27x reduction in circuit depth at epsilon ‚â§ 10^-8 error, and extends to unstable dynamics simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LCHS formalism requires finding kernel functions subject to complicated technical conditions on a half complex plane, making implementation difficult and limiting practical applications.

Method: Establish an alternative LCHS formalism based on Fourier transform that completely removes technical requirements beyond the real axis, providing simple and flexible kernel construction. Construct a different family of LCHS kernel functions.

Result: Achieved 1.81 times reduction in quantum differential equation algorithms based on LCHS, and 8.27 times reduction in quantum circuit depth at truncation error of Œµ ‚â§ 10^-8. Successfully extended LCHS scope to simulate linear unstable dynamics for short/intermediate time periods.

Conclusion: The Fourier-based LCHS formalism provides a simpler, more flexible approach with significant performance improvements in quantum differential equation algorithms and extends applicability to unstable dynamics simulation.

Abstract: Linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) connects the general
linear non-unitary dynamics with unitary operators and serves as the
mathematical backbone of designing near-optimal quantum linear differential
equation algorithms. However, the existing LCHS formalism needs to find a
kernel function subject to complicated technical conditions on a half complex
plane. In this work, we establish an alternative formalism of LCHS based on the
Fourier transform. Our new formalism completely removes the technical
requirements beyond the real axis, providing a simple and flexible way of
constructing LCHS kernel functions. Specifically, we construct a different
family of the LCHS kernel function, providing a $1.81$ times reduction in the
quantum differential equation algorithms based on LCHS, and an $8.27$ times
reduction in its quantum circuit depth at a truncation error of $\epsilon \le
10^{-8}$. Additionally, we extend the scope of the LCHS formula to the scenario
of simulating linear unstable dynamics for a short or intermediate time period.

*Lucia Vilchez-Estevez,Alexander Yosifov,Jinzhao Sun*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, showing that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time differently, and reveals a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether simulating open quantum systems can be comparable or even less complex than simulating closed systems, and to investigate how dissipation affects computational complexity in both quantum and classical simulation methods.

Method: The study investigates computational complexity using both quantum and classical methods, focusing on correlation length and mixing time parameters. Classical complexity is characterized by bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy, with numerical tensor network simulations.

Result: Dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at different timescales. Classical tensor network simulations show that classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.

Conclusion: There exists a fundamental separation between how quantum and classical simulation methods scale with dissipation strength, suggesting that quantum simulations may have advantages for certain open quantum system problems despite the apparent complexity introduced by environmental interactions.

Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium
processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and
can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed
the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the
intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the
computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two
physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore
whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed
counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating
open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the
classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator
entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation
length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales.
Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations,
classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a
separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Systematic bottom-up approach to derive field-theoretical models from atomistic molecular liquids using hierarchical coarse-graining and generalized mode theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular simulations are computationally prohibitive beyond molecular scale, and existing field-theoretical approaches are typically top-down, lacking bottom-up derivation from atomistic systems.

Method: Hierarchical approach using molecular coarse-grained models as intermediate step, Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation for canonical/grand canonical ensembles, generalized mode theory with additional fields, and efficient perturbative approach for Fourier modes.

Result: Developed a systematic strategy to bridge particle-based and field-theoretical modeling, preserving microscopic structural correlations while reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: This work provides a critical step toward integrating complex molecular interactions into field-theoretic descriptions, extending applicability beyond conventional limitations.

Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large
spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular
simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become
computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale.
Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these
limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these
approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the
bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular
systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical
field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical
step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques.
By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this
hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the
atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important
microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical
models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles
using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional
fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode
theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond
the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to
positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative
approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing
computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions
into the field-theoretic description.

### [44] [SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285)
*Joshua Shay Kricheli*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: Method to extract mechanical frequency combs using nonlinear beam dynamics and injection pulling effects, modeled via Duffing equation and reduced to Adler's equation for analytical solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a practical method for generating frequency combs in MEMS devices for various applications through mechanical means rather than optical approaches.

Method: Use nonlinear beam dynamics perturbed by external harmonic driver to achieve injection pulling and SNIC bifurcation. Model with Duffing equation, reduce to slow evolution model, and solve using Adler's equation with numerical simulations.

Result: Successful generation of frequency combs through mechanical means, with numerical simulations confirming theoretical predictions and validating the analytical approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively extracts frequency combs in mechanical systems using nonlinear dynamics and injection pulling, providing a viable alternative to optical frequency comb generation for MEMS applications.

Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical
means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The
method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting
non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse
vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small
amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam
eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations,
causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one
harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in
a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation,
rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the
problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that
translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to
the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to
mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed
of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical
assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase
equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These
assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively
simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution.
Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and
compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the
theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be
valid in extracting the comb.
