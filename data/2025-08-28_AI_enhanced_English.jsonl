Stabilization was shown to be crucial for solution accuracy, depending on frequencies relative to buoyancy frequency and Dirac source position.", "conclusion": "The HDG method is robust for solving stellar oscillation equations with realistic solar backgrounds, but requires careful stabilization choices to handle the mixed elliptic/hyperbolic nature of the wave operator influenced by gravity effects through the buoyancy frequency profile."}}
