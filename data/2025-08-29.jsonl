In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte\nCarlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method\nconstructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal\ndiscretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient\nvariance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in\nthe problem.

The microscopic model is a phase-field\nmodel within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions,\nwhere the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This\nmodel couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static\nMaxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature. The primary\nmathematical challenge lies in homogenizing these equations, which exhibit a\ncomplex doubly non-linear structure. Additionally, the extension operators used\nwithin the homogenization framework precludes the application of standard\nAubin--Lions compactness arguments. Our analysis employs two-scale convergence\nin conjunction with a two-scale decomposition based on an appropriate dilation\noperator. The nonlinearities are primarily addressed by means of a variant of\ncompensated compactness and a Vitali compactness argument. From the perspective\nof practical applications, this work enables the explicit calculation of a\nCurie temperature tensor, capturing at the macroscopic scale the coupled effect\nof the material's geometric structure and its magnetic permeability tensor."}

This\nresponse consists of a linear plus a cubic term, which are both inhomogeneous\nwith bounded coefficients. The cubic term is temporally retarded while the\nlinear term has instantaneous and retarded contributions. For slab waveguides\nwe show existence of breathers, which are time-periodic, real-valued solutions\nthat are localized in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide, and\nmoreover they are traveling along one direction of the waveguide. We find these\nbreathers using a variational method which relies on the assumption that an\neffective operator related to the linear part of Maxwell's equations has a\nspectral gap about $0$. We also give examples of material coefficients,\nincluding nonperiodic materials, where such a spectral gap is present."}

The\nmethod combines multi-interval Fourier extension approximations with an\nadaptive domain partitioning strategy: a global precomputation of local Fourier\nsampling matrices and their thin SVDs is reused throughout a recursive\nbisection procedure that selects locally-resolved Fourier fits. Each accepted\nsubinterval stores a compact set of Fourier coefficients that are subsequently\nused to reconstruct the derivative via a precomputed differentiation operator.\nThe stopping criterion balances fitting error and an explicit noise-level\nbound, and the algorithm automatically refines the partition where the function\nexhibits rapid oscillations or boundary activity. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving accurate\nderivative reconstruction for challenging functions. The approach provides a\nrobust framework for ill-posed differentiation problems while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency."}
