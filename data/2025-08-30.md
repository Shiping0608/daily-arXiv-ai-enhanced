### [1] [Multi-Order Monte Carlo IMEX hierarchies for uncertainty quantification in multiscale hyperbolic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20187)
*Giulia Bertaglia,Walter Boscheri,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel Multi-Order Monte Carlo method for uncertainty quantification in multiscale time-dependent PDEs using Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta integrators with varying spatial/temporal discretization orders instead of hierarchical re-meshing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Multi-Level Monte Carlo methods require costly hierarchical re-meshing and face computational challenges with hyperbolic systems, kinetic equations, and low Mach number flows with multiple scales.

Method: Uses Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time integrators to create multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal discretization orders within Monte Carlo framework, satisfying asymptotic-preserving property.

Result: Achieves substantial reduction of both error and variance while maintaining asymptotic consistency in the asymptotic limit, with efficient variance reduction.

Conclusion: The Multi-Order Monte Carlo approach is particularly well-suited for multiscale problems and provides an effective alternative to traditional Multi-Level Monte Carlo with better computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Multi-Order Monte Carlo approach for uncertainty
quantification in the context of multiscale time-dependent partial differential
equations. The new framework leverages Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time
integrators to satisfy the asymptotic-preserving property across different
discretization orders of accuracy. In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte
Carlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method
constructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal
discretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient
variance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in
the problem. The proposed method is particularly well-suited for hyperbolic
systems with stiff relaxation, kinetic equations, and low Mach number flows,
where standard Multi-Level Monte Carlo techniques often encounter computational
challenges. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel Multi-Order Monte
Carlo approach achieves substantial reduction of both error and variance while
maintaining asymptotic consistency in the asymptotic limit.

### [2] [Operator learning meets inverse problems: A probabilistic perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20207)
*Nicholas H. Nelsen,Yunan Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Survey of operator learning methods for solving inverse problems, focusing on end-to-end approaches that map data directly to solutions without explicit forward models, and covering both probabilistic and deterministic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of the intersection between operator learning and inverse problems, addressing the need for efficient data-driven methods that can handle infinite-dimensional function spaces and complex mappings.

Method: Covers probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, measure-centric formulations, operator learning components (data generation, loss functions, architectures), and end-to-end inverse operator learning paradigms.

Result: Presents a structured framework for understanding how operator learning can be applied to inverse problems, highlighting both point prediction and posterior estimation methods with structure-aware architectures.

Conclusion: Operator learning provides powerful tools for solving inverse problems through direct data-to-solution mapping, with emerging theoretical foundations and applications across linear and nonlinear problems, including prior and regularizer estimation.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

### [3] [Automated Runge-Kutta-Nyström time stepping for finite element methods in Irksome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20255)
*Robert C. Kirby,Scott P. MacLachlan,Pablo D. Brubeck*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Irksome library now supports second-order temporal derivatives in PDEs using Runge-Kutta-Nyström methods, generating smaller algebraic systems and better performance compared to first-order reformulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable direct discretization of second-order time derivatives in PDEs without needing to rewrite them as first-order systems, providing more efficient and natural problem formulation.

Method: Extends Irksome library based on UFL to generate stage-coupled variational problems for Runge-Kutta-Nyström methods, with Firedrake generating code and PETSc integration for solving.

Result: Numerical results show fully implicit Runge-Kutta-Nyström methods can be competitive with explicit methods for wave equations when properly preconditioned, and effectively handle mixed temporal order systems like poroelasticity.

Conclusion: The updates enable efficient solution of second-order temporal derivative problems with advantages in system size, runtime, and problem formulation fidelity, making implicit methods viable for wave-type equations.

Abstract: Irksome is a library based on the Unified Form Language (UFL) that automates
the application of Runge-Kutta time-stepping methods for finite element spatial
discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs). This paper describes
recent updates to Irksome that allow users to express semidiscrete forms of
PDEs that contain second-order temporal derivatives, whence it generates
stage-coupled variational problems to be solved at each time step for
Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods. Firedrake then generates code for these
variational problems and provides a rich interface to PETSc for solving them.
Directly discretizing second-order time derivatives with Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om
methods provides several advantages relative to discretizing a rewritten
first-order system with a standard Runge-Kutta method. Besides working with an
interface closer to the problem formulation in UFL, avoiding these auxiliary
variables means that Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods lead to smaller algebraic
systems and better run-time. Our numerical results indicate that, with
effective preconditioning, fully implicit Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om methods can be
made competitive with more traditional explicit methods for wave equations.
They are also (essentially) required to discretize wave-type equations with
higher-order spatial derivatives. We also provide numerical experiments for
fully dynamic poroelasticity, a system of mixed temporal order, where our
time-stepping and algebraic solvers perform effectively even as we approach the
incompressible limit.

### [4] [Randomized Krylov methods for inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20269)
*Julianne Chung,Silvia Gazzola*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Randomized Krylov subspace methods using sketched inner products for efficient regularized solutions to large-scale linear inverse problems with rectangular matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient computational methods for solving large-scale linear inverse problems with rectangular matrices, extending beyond the capabilities of existing randomized GMRES methods.

Method: Proposes randomized Golub-Kahan approach based on randomized Gram-Schmidt process, with iterative solvers and hybrid projection methods combining randomized Arnoldi/Golub-Kahan factorizations with Tikhonov regularization.

Result: Numerical results from image deblurring and seismic tomography demonstrate the potential benefits of these randomized approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed randomized Krylov subspace methods provide efficient solutions for large-scale linear inverse problems with rectangular matrices, showing promise in practical applications like image processing and seismic tomography.

Abstract: In this paper we develop randomized Krylov subspace methods for efficiently
computing regularized solutions to large-scale linear inverse problems.
Building on the recently developed randomized Gram-Schmidt process, where
sketched inner products are used to estimate inner products of high-dimensional
vectors, we propose a randomized Golub-Kahan approach that works for general
rectangular matrices. We describe new iterative solvers based on the randomized
Golub-Kahan approach and show how they can be used for solving inverse problems
with rectangular matrices, thus extending the capabilities of the recently
proposed randomized GMRES method. We also consider hybrid projection methods
that combine iterative projection methods, based on both the randomized Arnoldi
and randomized Golub-Kahan factorizations, with Tikhonov regularization, where
regularization parameters can be selected automatically during the iterative
process. Numerical results from image deblurring and seismic tomography show
the potential benefits of these approaches.

### [5] [An Efficient Exponential Sum Approximation of Power-Law Kernels for Solving Fractional Differential Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20311)
*Renu Chaudhary,Kai Diethelm,Afshin Farhadi,Fred A. Fuchs*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A framework for approximating fractional integral/differential operators using exponential sums with controlled computational cost and error minimization, featuring compression techniques and application to solving fractional differential equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient and accurate method for approximating weakly singular power-law kernels in fractional calculus, enabling practical solution of fractional differential equations with controlled computational complexity.

Method: Uses exponential sum approximation of the power-law kernel via Laplace transform and trapezoidal rule, with truncation for feasibility. Implements a two-stage compression algorithm using Prony's method. Embeds compressed kernel into Riemann-Liouville fractional integral and applies two solution strategies: piecewise constant interpolation and transformation to ODE systems.

Result: The method achieves accurate approximation of fractional operators with pre-specified computational cost. Numerical results demonstrate advantages, accuracy, and experimental order of convergence when applied to well-known fractional differential equations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and accurate approach for solving fractional differential equations using exponential sum approximations with controlled computational complexity, making them solvable by standard ODE solvers while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for approximating the
weakly singular power-law kernel $t^{\alpha-1}$ of fractional integral and
differential operators, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $t \in [\delta,T]$ with
$0<\delta<T<\infty$, using a finite sum of exponentials. This approximation
method begins by substituting an exponential function into the Laplace
transform of the power function, followed by the application of the trapezoidal
rule to approximate the resulting integral. To ensure computational
feasibility, the integral limits are truncated, leading to a finite exponential
sum representation of the kernel. In contrast to earlier approaches, we
pre-specify the admitted computational cost (measured in terms of the number of
exponentials) and minimize the approximation error. Furthermore, to reduce the
computational cost while maintaining accuracy, we present a two-stage algorithm
based on Prony's method that compresses the exponential sum. The compressed
kernel is then embedded into the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral and
applied to solve fractional differential equations. To this end, we discuss two
solution strategies, namely (a) method based on piecewise constant
interpolation and (b) a transformation of the original fractional differential
equation into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
This reformulation makes the problem solvable by standard ODE solvers with low
computational cost while retaining the accuracy benefits of the
exponential-sum-approximation. Finally, we apply the proposed strategies to
solve some well-known fractional differential equations and demonstrate the
advantages, accuracy, and the experimental order of convergence of the methods
through numerical results.

### [6] [Artificial neural network solver for Fokker-Planck and Koopman eigenfunctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20339)
*Max Kreider,Peter J. Thomas,Yao Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Neural network solver for computing eigenfunctions of Fokker-Planck and Koopman operators in stochastic differential equations, using operator-based loss functions to reduce data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for computing eigenfunctions of Fokker-Planck and stochastic Koopman operators require solving high-dimensional PDEs on unbounded domains, which is numerically challenging and computationally expensive.

Method: Data-driven artificial neural network solver that incorporates the differential operator directly into the loss function, improving accuracy while reducing the need for large amounts of accurate training data.

Result: The approach was successfully demonstrated on several numerical examples in two, three, and four dimensions, showing effective computation of eigenfunctions for stochastic systems.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network method provides an effective alternative to traditional PDE solvers for computing eigenfunctions in stochastic systems, offering improved accuracy with reduced data requirements.

Abstract: For a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is an It\^{o} diffusion or
Langevin equation, the Fokker-Planck operator governs the evolution of the
probability density, while its adjoint, the infinitesimal generator of the
stochastic Koopman operator, governs the evolution of system observables, in
the mean. The eigenfunctions of these operators provide a powerful framework to
analyze SDEs, and have shown to be particularly useful for systems of
stochastic oscillators. However, computing these eigenfunctions typically
requires solving high-dimensional PDEs on unbounded domains, which is
numerically challenging. Building on previous work, we propose a data-driven
artificial neural network solver for Koopman and Fokker-Planck eigenfunctions.
Our approach incorporates the differential operator into the loss function,
improving accuracy and reducing dependence on large amounts of accurate
training data. We demonstrate our approach on several numerical examples in
two, three, and four dimensions.

### [7] [Numerical Method for Space-Time Fractional Diffusion: A Stochastic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20361)
*Tengteng Cui,Chengtao Sheng,Bihao Su,Zhi Zhou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm combining stable subordinator simulation and walk-on-spheres method for solving space-time fractional diffusion models with proven error bounds and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space-time fractional diffusion models present significant computational challenges due to memory effects and nonlocal operators, especially in high dimensions, requiring efficient numerical methods.

Method: Monte Carlo method based on Feynman-Kac formula, combining simulation of monotone path of stable subordinator for time and walk-on-spheres method for spatial stable Levy jumping process.

Result: Rigorous error bounds derived in terms of simulation paths and time step size. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical bounds and show efficiency in complex geometries and high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: The proposed stochastic algorithm is robust across fractional orders, particularly effective for small fractional values, and outperforms traditional methods in computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyze a stochastic algorithm for solving
space-time fractional diffusion models, which are widely used to describe
anomalous diffusion dynamics. These models pose substantial numerical
challenges due to the memory effect of the time-fractional derivative and the
nonlocal nature of the spatial fractional Laplacian and the, leading to
significant computational costs and storage demands, particularly in
high-dimensional settings. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a Monte
Carlo method based on the Feynman--Kac formula for space-time fractional
models. The novel algorithm combines the simulation of the monotone path of a
stable subordinator in time with the ``walk-on-spheres'' method that
efficiently simulates the stable Levy jumping process in space. We rigorously
derive error bounds for the proposed scheme, explicitly expressed in terms of
the number of simulation paths and the time step size. Numerical experiments
confirm the theoretical error bounds and demonstrate the computational
efficiency of the method, particularly in domains with complex geometries or
high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, both theoretical and numerical results
emphasize the robustness of the proposed approach across a range of fractional
orders, particularly for small fractional values, a capability often absent in
traditional numerical methods.

*Xun Yang,Guanqiu Ma*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: D3PINNs framework combines PINNs with dynamic domain decomposition to solve time-dependent PDEs by reducing them to ODEs, maintaining PINN efficiency while improving time-dependent solution capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Physics-Informed Neural Networks' ability to solve time-dependent PDEs more effectively while retaining computational efficiency.

Method: Uses PINNs with domain decomposition to get approximate solution, then reduces PDE to ODE by replacing spatial terms, and solves with classical ODE numerical methods.

Result: Framework successfully captures dynamic solutions of time-dependent PDEs while maintaining computational efficiency of PINNs.

Conclusion: D3PINNs provide an effective approach for solving time-dependent PDEs by combining neural networks with classical numerical methods, validated through numerical experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Dynamic Domain Decomposition
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (D3PINNs), for solving time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this framework, solutions of time-dependent
PDEs are dynamically captured. First, an approximate
  solution is obtained by the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
containing the domain decomposition, then the time derivative terms in the PDE
will be retained and the other terms associated with the solution will be
replaced with the approximate solution. As a result, the PDE reduces to an
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, the time-varying solution will
be solved by the classical numerical methods for ODEs. D3PINNs retain the
computational efffciency and ffexibility inherent to PINNs and enhance the
ability for capturing solutions of time-dependent PDEs. Numerical experiments
validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### [9] [A Chebyshev--Jackson series based block SS--RR algorithm for computing partial eigenpairs of real symmetric matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20456)
*Zhongxiao Jia,Tianhang Liu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new algorithm using Chebyshev-Jackson series expansion for eigenpair computations that avoids solving expensive linear systems and is more efficient than traditional contour integral methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency for eigenpair computations of large symmetric matrices by avoiding the expensive solution of large shifted complex linear systems required in traditional contour integral methods.

Method: Uses Chebyshev-Jackson series expansion to approximate moments instead of numerical quadrature, which only involves matrix-vector products. Proves convergence of CJ series for higher order moments and develops a CJ-SS-RR algorithm.

Result: The CJ series expansions pointwise converge to moments with different convergence rates. Numerical experiments show the new algorithm is more efficient than the contour integral-based block SS-RR algorithm with trapezoidal rule.

Conclusion: The Chebyshev-Jackson series expansion approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional contour integral methods for eigenpair computations, avoiding expensive linear system solutions while maintaining convergence properties.

Abstract: This paper considers eigenpair computations of large symmetric matrices with
the desired eigenvalues lying in a given interval using the contour
integral-based block SS--RR method, a Rayleigh--Ritz projection onto a certain
subspace generated by moment matrices. Instead of using a numerical quadrature
to approximately compute the moments by solving a number of large shifted
complex linear systems at each iteration, we make use of the Chebyshev--Jackson
(CJ) series expansion to approximate the moments, which only involves
matrix-vector products and avoids expensive solutions of the linear systems. We
prove that the CJ series expansions pointwise converge to the moments as the
series degree increases, but at different convergence rates depending on point
positions and moment orders. These extend the available convergence results on
the zeroth moment of CJ series expansions to higher order ones. Based on the
results established, we develop a CJ--SS--RR algorithm. Numerical experiments
illustrate that the new algorithm is more efficient than the contour
integral-based block SS--RR algorithm with the trapezoidal rule.

### [10] [Tsunami modeling with dynamic seafloors: a high-order solver validated with shallow water benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20596)
*Thomas Melkior,Harsha S Bhat,Faisal Amlani*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A pseudo-spectral algorithm using Fourier continuation is developed to model tsunami generation with time-dependent seafloor motion, providing high accuracy and efficiency compared to conventional instantaneous displacement models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional tsunami models neglect dynamic ground movement and assume instantaneous seafloor displacement, missing observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave generation from earthquake rupture dynamics.

Method: Pseudo-spectral algorithm based on Fourier continuation methodology for solving nonlinear shallow water equations with time-dependent seafloor displacement and velocity, providing high-order convergence and minimal numerical dispersion.

Result: The solver achieves high accuracy, computational efficiency, and effectively eliminates numerical pollution errors. It enables efficient resolution of different space-time scales in tsunami modeling and facilitates parametric studies on earthquake speed effects.

Conclusion: The proposed Fourier continuation-based approach demonstrates the critical importance of incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard assessment, with minimal numerical tuning required.

Abstract: Recent scientific studies have suggested that, in certain physical
configurations, the time-dependent behavior of earthquake rupture and seafloor
(bathymetry) motion can leave observable near-field signatures in tsunami wave
generation and propagation. However, dynamic ground movement is often neglected
in conventional tsunami models, which commonly assume instantaneous ground
displacement (sourcing). This work introduces a pseudo-spectral algorithm for
the solution of the nonlinear shallow water equations with timedependent
seafloor displacement and velocity. Based on a Fourier continuation (FC)
methodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic
function, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild
(linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time
integration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or
''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust
resolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis
generated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances).
Numerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are
presented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference
methodologies. The solver is physically validated by a number of classical and
semi-classical benchmark cases based on simulated or experimental data.
Additionally, a seismologically realistic, first-of-its-kind parametric study
based on earthquake speed is introduced, whose results-easily facilitated by
the FC-based approach proposed herein, with minimal numerical tuning-further
demonstrate the potential importance of (and the motivation herein for)
incorporating time-dependent seafloor behavior in quantitative tsunami hazard
assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for comparing different finite element discretization approaches for harmonic map heat flow problems and establish their theoretical and practical performance

Method: Review and systematic comparison of three finite element discretization methods in a unified framework, including numerical tests for convergence rates and computational efficiency analysis, with derivation of discrete inf-sup stability for one method

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating finite element methods for harmonic map heat flow, with established convergence properties and efficiency comparisons, including stability results for one method

Abstract: In this paper, we review and systematically compare three finite element
discretization methods for a harmonic map heat flow problem from the unit disk
in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in an unified framework.
Numerical tests validate the convergence rates in a regime of smooth solutions

*Ernesto Pimentel-García,Lucas O. Müller,Carlos Parés*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: High-order numerical schemes for blood flow models with discontinuous properties and source terms, using Generalized Hydrostatic Reconstruction and numerical steady state preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate numerical methods for blood flow modeling that can handle discontinuous mechanical properties and algebraic source terms (friction/gravity) while preserving steady states.

Method: Generalized Hydrostatic Reconstruction for parameter discontinuities, numerical reconstruction operator for steady state identification/preservation, extension to vessel networks.

Result: Methods outperform naive discretizations in single- and multiple-vessel tests, including a 118-vessel network, demonstrating improved accuracy and performance.

Conclusion: The presented well-balanced, high-order schemes effectively handle blood flow models with discontinuities and source terms, providing superior performance over basic discretization approaches.

Abstract: We present well-balanced, high-order, semi-discrete numerical schemes for
one-dimensional blood flow models with discontinuous mechanical properties and
algebraic source terms representing friction and gravity. While discontinuities
in model parameters are handled using the Generalized Hydrostatic
Reconstruction, the presence of algebraic source terms implies that steady
state solutions cannot always be computed analytically. In fact, steady states
are defined by an ordinary differential equation that needs to be integrated
numerically. Therefore, we resort on a numerical reconstruction operator to
identify and, where appropriate, preserve steady states with an accuracy that
depends on the reconstruction operator's numerical scheme. We extend our
methods to deal with networks of vessels and show numerical results for single-
and multiple-vessel tests, including a network of 118 vessels, demonstrating
the capacity of the presented methods to outperform naive discretizations of
the equations under study.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mathematical framework that captures how coordinate system choices and curvature interact in transport problems, providing geometric insights for simplifying angular dependence.

Method: Parametrize angular variable using local orthonormal frame, express directional derivatives in terms of curvature-related quantities reflecting spatial manifold geometry.

Result: Derived general expression for streaming term that highlights geometric interpretation of components and shows interaction between coordinate choices and curvature.

Conclusion: The framework provides intuitive insight for simplifying angular dependence and guides selection of coordinate systems balancing analytical tractability with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We derive a general expression for the streaming term in radiative transport
equa- tions and other transport problems when formulated in curvilinear
coordinates, emphasizing coordinate systems adapted to the geometry of the
domain and the directional dependence of particle transport. By parametrizing
the angular vari- able using a local orthonormal frame, we express directional
derivatives in terms of curvature-related quantities that reflect the geometry
of underlying spatial man- ifolds. Our formulation highlights how the
interaction between coordinate choices and curvature influences the streaming
operator, offering geometric interpretations of its components. The resulting
framework offers intuitive insight into when and how angular dependence can be
simplified and may guide the selection of coordinate systems that balance
analytical tractability and computational efficiency.

*Xiangyun Meng,Martin Stynes*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Finite element method using rectangular Morley elements on Shishkin mesh achieves O(N^{-3/2}) convergence for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems, outperforming previous Adini element methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems with boundary layers more efficiently using improved finite element methods that provide better convergence rates than existing approaches.

Method: Discretize the problem using rectangular Morley finite elements on a Shishkin mesh, with analysis in an energy-type norm natural for this class of problems.

Result: Proved O(ε^{1/2}N^{-1} + εN^{-1}lnN + N^{-3/2}) convergence rate, achieving superior O(N^{-3/2}) performance when ε ≈ N^{-1}, compared to O(N^{-1/2}) from previous Adini element methods.

Conclusion: The Morley element method on Shishkin mesh provides significantly better convergence rates for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems with boundary layers, as validated by numerical experiments showing the sharpness of the proved bounds.

Abstract: The singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem $\varepsilon^2\Delta^2 u
- \mathrm{div}\left(c\nabla u\right) = f$ is considered on the unit square
$\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with homogenous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Its
solution typically contains boundary layers on all sides of~$\Omega$. It is
discretised by a finite element method that uses rectangular Morley elements on
a Shishkin mesh. In an associated energy-type norm that is natural for this
problem, we prove an $O(\varepsilon^{1/2}N^{-1}+\varepsilon N^{-1}\ln N +
N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence for the error in the computed solution, where
$N$~is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction. Thus in the
most troublesome regime when $\varepsilon \approx N^{-1}$, our method is proved
to attain an $O(N^{-3/2})$ rate of convergence, which is shown to be sharp by
our numerical experiments and is superior to the $O(N^{-1/2})$ rate that is
proved in Meng & Stynes, Adv. Comput. Math. 2019 when Adini finite elements are
used to solve the same problem on the same mesh.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Efficient algorithm for stable numerical differentiation from noisy data using Fourier extension approximations with adaptive domain partitioning and recursive bisection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ill-posed problem of numerical differentiation from noisy, uniformly-sampled data by developing a computationally efficient and stable method that can handle challenging functions with rapid oscillations or boundary activity.

Method: Combines multi-interval Fourier extension approximations with adaptive domain partitioning strategy. Uses global precomputation of local Fourier sampling matrices and their thin SVDs, recursive bisection procedure to select locally-resolved Fourier fits, and precomputed differentiation operator for derivative reconstruction.

Result: Numerical experiments show significant improvements over existing methods, achieving accurate derivative reconstruction for challenging functions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust framework for ill-posed differentiation problems, offering stable and efficient derivative computation from noisy data through adaptive Fourier extension techniques.

Abstract: We present a computationally efficient algorithm for stable numerical
differentiation from noisy, uniformly-sampled data on a bounded interval. The
method combines multi-interval Fourier extension approximations with an
adaptive domain partitioning strategy: a global precomputation of local Fourier
sampling matrices and their thin SVDs is reused throughout a recursive
bisection procedure that selects locally-resolved Fourier fits. Each accepted
subinterval stores a compact set of Fourier coefficients that are subsequently
used to reconstruct the derivative via a precomputed differentiation operator.
The stopping criterion balances fitting error and an explicit noise-level
bound, and the algorithm automatically refines the partition where the function
exhibits rapid oscillations or boundary activity. Numerical experiments
demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving accurate
derivative reconstruction for challenging functions. The approach provides a
robust framework for ill-posed differentiation problems while maintaining
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional floating-point discretizations by developing a simple bit-based approach compatible with stochastic computing architectures and eliminating complex drift/diffusion computations.

Method: Uses lattice random walk with binary or ternary increments (1-2 bit random values) instead of floating-point operations, suppressing complex computations to simple probability distribution manipulations.

Result: Proven weak convergence and demonstrated advantages through experiments on various SDEs including state-of-the-art diffusion models, showing robustness to quantization errors and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts.

Conclusion: The approach provides a significant departure from traditional methods with advantages in hardware compatibility, computational simplicity, and robustness, making it suitable for modern stochastic computing architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a lattice random walk discretisation scheme for stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) that samples binary or ternary increments at each
step, suppressing complex drift and diffusion computations to simple 1 or 2 bit
random values. This approach is a significant departure from traditional
floating point discretisations and offers several advantages; including
compatibility with stochastic computing architectures that avoid floating-point
arithmetic in place of directly manipulating the underlying probability
distribution of a bitstream, elimination of Gaussian sampling requirements,
robustness to quantisation errors, and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts. We
prove weak convergence and demonstrate the advantages through experiments on
various SDEs, including state-of-the-art diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle tensor decompositions in Extended Tensor Train format where some factors are constrained to be equal, which breaks the multilinear structure and presents optimization challenges.

Method: Developed Riemannian optimization methods that naturally handle factor sharing constraints, proved the underlying manifold is smooth, created efficient algorithms including quasi-optimal retraction and tangent space projection using automatic differentiation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated practical effectiveness through tensor approximation tasks and multidimensional eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: Riemannian optimization provides an effective framework for handling factor sharing constraints in Extended Tensor Train decompositions, with efficient algorithms enabling practical applications.

Abstract: This paper studies tensors that admit decomposition in the Extended Tensor
Train (ETT) format, with a key focus on the case where some decomposition
factors are constrained to be equal. This factor sharing introduces additional
challenges, as it breaks the multilinear structure of the decomposition.
Nevertheless, we show that Riemannian optimization methods can naturally handle
such constraints and prove that the underlying manifold is indeed smooth. We
develop efficient algorithms for key Riemannian optimization components,
including a retraction operation based on quasi-optimal approximation in the
new format, as well as tangent space projection using automatic
differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our
approach through tensor approximation tasks and multidimensional eigenvalue
problem.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of a nonlinear diffusion-aggregation model with (s,p) Riesz potential, focusing on radial stationary states and their connection to Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities and free energy minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the competition between nonlinear diffusion (porous medium type) and nonlocal aggregation effects described by nonlinear Riesz potentials, and to characterize stationary states in such systems.

Method: Investigation of radial stationary states, analysis of their relation to extremals of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities, study of global minimizers of homogeneous free energy functionals, and asymptotic analysis as the fractional parameter s approaches zero.

Result: Established connections between radial stationary states and extremals of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. Showed that when aggregation doesn't dominate diffusion, these states relate to global minimizers of free energy. Described asymptotic behavior of stationary states as s→0, where nonlocal interaction becomes backward diffusion.

Conclusion: The model reveals rich mathematical structure connecting nonlinear diffusion-aggregation dynamics with functional inequalities and free energy minimization principles, with interesting asymptotic behavior in the fractional parameter limit.

Abstract: We consider an evolution model with nonlinear diffusion of porous medium type
in competition with a nonlocal drift term favoring mass aggregation. The
distinguishing trait of the model is the choice of a nonlinear $(s,p)$ Riesz
potential for describing the overall aggregation effect. We investigate radial
stationary states of the dynamics, showing their relation with extremals of
suitable Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. In the case that aggregation
does not dominate over diffusion, radial stationary states also relate to
global minimizers of a homogeneous free energy functional featuring the $(s,p)$
energy associated to the nonlinear potential. In the limit as the fractional
parameter $s$ tends to zero, the nonlocal interaction term becomes a backward
diffusion and we describe the asymptotic behavior of the stationary states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a complete and sharp characterization of the regularity properties of the semigroup associated with coupled second-order evolution equations with indirect damping, building on recent stability studies.

Method: Derived asymptotic expressions of eigenvalues of the generator, partitioned parameter space into disjoint regions, and estimated the resolvent of the generator on the imaginary axis.

Result: Successfully partitioned parameter space into regions where the semigroup exhibits either analyticity or Gevrey class regularity, providing a complete regularity characterization.

Conclusion: The study offers a comprehensive and sharp regularity analysis for the semigroup of coupled second-order evolution equations with indirect damping, with different regularity properties emerging in distinct parameter regions.

Abstract: We investigate the regularity of the strongly continuous semigroup associated
with a system of two coupled second order evolution equations with indirect
damping, whose stability was recently studied by Hao et al. By deriving the
asymptotic expression of the eigenvalues the generator, we partition the
parameter space into several disjoint regions, where the semigroup exhibits
either analyticity or Gevrey class regularity. Together with the estimate of
the resolvent of the generator on the imaginary axis, we give a complete and

TL;DR: Homogenization of phase-field model for paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in perforated 3D materials, deriving effective macroscopic equations and Curie temperature tensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously predict effective equations governing phase transitions in perforated magnetic materials with periodic microstructures, enabling macroscopic characterization of coupled geometric and magnetic properties.

Method: Uses two-scale convergence with dilation operator, compensated compactness, and Vitali compactness to homogenize coupled nonlinear equations (Ginzburg-Landau phase-field model with Maxwell system and temperature equation) as microstructure period tends to zero.

Result: Successfully derived macroscopic effective equations and enables explicit calculation of Curie temperature tensor that captures coupled effects of material geometry and magnetic permeability at macroscopic scale.

Conclusion: The work provides a mathematical framework for homogenizing complex doubly nonlinear phase transition models in perforated materials, overcoming challenges from extension operators and enabling practical computation of macroscopic magnetic properties.

Abstract: This work presents a rigorous prediction of the effective equations governing
the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition in a perforated
three-dimensional body. Assuming a periodic distribution of perforations, we
investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the equations describing
the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the material as the period
of the microstructure tends to zero. The microscopic model is a phase-field
model within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions,
where the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This
model couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static
Maxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature. The primary
mathematical challenge lies in homogenizing these equations, which exhibit a
complex doubly non-linear structure. Additionally, the extension operators used
within the homogenization framework precludes the application of standard
Aubin--Lions compactness arguments. Our analysis employs two-scale convergence
in conjunction with a two-scale decomposition based on an appropriate dilation
operator. The nonlinearities are primarily addressed by means of a variant of
compensated compactness and a Vitali compactness argument. From the perspective
of practical applications, this work enables the explicit calculation of a
Curie temperature tensor, capturing at the macroscopic scale the coupled effect
of the material's geometric structure and its magnetic permeability tensor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously study the mathematical behavior of two-phase flow systems under extreme conditions (large friction and incompressible limits) and establish global-in-time convergence results for ill-prepared initial data.

Method: Established uniform regularity estimates with respect to friction coefficient τ, proved strong convergence to drift-flux model as τ→0 with √τ convergence rate, studied large-time asymptotic behavior, and analyzed incompressible limit as Mach number ε→0.

Result: Successfully justified strong convergence of Euler-NS system to one-velocity two-phase drift-flux model with explicit convergence rate √τ. Proved incompressible limit of DF model to Transport-Navier-Stokes system and combined large-friction/incompressible limit for Euler-NS to TNS system.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete mathematical justification for singular limit processes in two-phase flow systems, establishing global-in-time convergence results with explicit rates for ill-prepared initial data in critical Besov spaces.

Abstract: We investigate the large-friction and incompressible limits for a two-phase
flow (Euler-NS) system which couples the pressureless Euler equations and the
isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations through a drag force term with
the friction coefficient $\frac{1}{\tau}>0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d\geq2$). We
establish the uniform regularity estimates with respect to $\tau$ so that the
solution of the Cauchy problem for the Euler-NS system exists globally in time,
provided that the initial data are uniformly close to the equilibrium state in
a critical Besov space. These uniform estimates allow us to rigorously justify
the strong convergence of the Euler-NS system to a one-velocity two-phase
drift-flux (DF) model as $\tau \to 0$, with an explicit convergence rate of
order $\sqrt{\tau}$. We also study the large-time asymptotic behavior of
solutions for the Euler-NS system, uniformly with respect to $\tau$. Moreover,
when the Mach number $\varepsilon>0$ is considered, we prove the incompressible
limit of the DF model toward the Transport-Navier-Stokes (TNS) system as
$\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, and justify the combined large-friction and
incompressible limit for the Euler-NS system toward the TNS system in the
regime $\tau=\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$. Each singular limit process is globally
valid in time for {\emph{ill-prepared}} initial data.

TL;DR: Study of clamped transmission eigenvalue problem from elastic plate scattering, proving existence of infinitely many real eigenvalues and their relationship to Dirichlet/Neumann eigenvalues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze a new transmission eigenvalue problem derived from scattering of clamped obstacles in thin elastic plates, which presents unique analytical and computational challenges compared to other models.

Method: Study the variational formulation of the clamped transmission eigenvalue problem, which is a system of homogeneous PDEs defined throughout R², and investigate connections to Dirichlet/Neumann eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian.

Result: Proved existence of infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues through analysis of the equivalent variational formulation.

Conclusion: The clamped transmission eigenvalue problem exhibits rich mathematical structure with infinitely many real eigenvalues, providing important connections to classical eigenvalue problems for scattering analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the so-called clamped transmission eigenvalue
problem. This is a new transmission eigenvalue problem that is derived from the
scattering of an impenetrable clamped obstacle in a thin elastic plate. The
scattering problem is modeled by a biharmonic wave operator given by the
Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem in the frequency domain. These
scattering problems have not been studied to the extent of other models. Unlike
other transmission eigenvalue problems, the problem studied here is a system of
homogeneous PDEs defined in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This provides unique
analytical and computational difficulties when studying the clamped
transmission eigenvalue problem. We are able to prove that there exist
infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues. This is done by studying
the equivalent variational formulation. We also investigate the relationship of
the clamped transmission eigenvalues to the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues
of the negative Laplacian for the bounded scattering obstacle.

Motivation: Extend nonlocal counterparts to previous local free boundary problems in superconductivity, addressing models where no PDE governs the moving sets with vanishing gradients

Method: Analysis of degenerate nonlocal free boundary problems using viscosity solutions approach, where test functions only require nonzero gradient

Result: Main results establish interior gradient Hölder regularity estimates for viscosity solutions

Conclusion: Successfully extends regularity theory to nonlocal setting for superconductivity free boundary problems with degenerate conditions

Abstract: This paper investigates degenerate nonlocal free boundary problems arising in
the context of superconductivity, extending the nonlocal counterpart to the
work of Caffarelli, Salazar, and Shahgholian \cite{CS02, CSS04} in the local
setting. In these models, no partial differential equation governs the moving
sets where the gradient vanishes, meaning that test functions are only required
to have a nonzero gradient. Our main results provide interior gradient H\"older

TL;DR: Homogenisation analysis of elliptic Ambrosio-Tortorelli functionals with linear gradient growth, showing convergence to free-discontinuity energy with jump-dependent surface term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous homogenisation for image-segmentation models with fine-scale oscillations and phase-field regularisations, particularly for functionals with linear gradient growth rather than classical superlinear growth.

Method: Analysis of elliptic functionals of Ambrosio-Tortorelli type with linear growth in gradient variable, under mild assumptions including stationary random integrands.

Result: The functionals homogenise to a free-discontinuity energy where the surface term explicitly depends on the jump amplitude of the limit variable.

Conclusion: This provides the first rigorous homogenisation procedure for such image-segmentation models, extending results to the linear growth case and random media.

Abstract: We propose a first rigorous homogenisation procedure in image-segmentation
models by analysing the relative impact of (possibly random) fine-scale
oscillations and phase-field regularisations for a family of elliptic
functionals of Ambrosio and Tortorelli type, when the regularised volume term
grows \emph{linearly} in the gradient variable. In contrast to the more
classical case of superlinear growth, we show that our functionals homogenise
to a free-discontinuity energy whose surface term explicitly depends on the
jump amplitude of the limit variable. The convergence result as above is
obtained under very mild assumptions which allow us to treat, among other, the
case of \emph{stationary random integrands}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prove the existence of time-periodic, spatially localized traveling wave solutions (breathers) in nonlinear optical waveguides described by Maxwell's equations with Kerr-type nonlinearities.

Method: Variational method that assumes the linear part of Maxwell's equations has a spectral gap around 0. Analysis considers inhomogeneous materials with bounded coefficients, including instantaneous and temporally retarded linear terms plus cubic nonlinear response.

Result: Demonstrated existence of breathers - time-periodic, real-valued solutions localized perpendicular to the waveguide and traveling along it. Provided examples of material coefficients (including nonperiodic materials) where the required spectral gap condition is satisfied.

Conclusion: Breathers exist in Kerr-type optical slab waveguides under spectral gap conditions, with the variational approach successfully identifying these nonlinear wave solutions in both periodic and nonperiodic material configurations.

Abstract: We consider Maxwell's equations for Kerr-type optical materials, which are
magnetically inactive and have a nonlinear response to electric fields. This
response consists of a linear plus a cubic term, which are both inhomogeneous
with bounded coefficients. The cubic term is temporally retarded while the
linear term has instantaneous and retarded contributions. For slab waveguides
we show existence of breathers, which are time-periodic, real-valued solutions
that are localized in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide, and
moreover they are traveling along one direction of the waveguide. We find these
breathers using a variational method which relies on the assumption that an
effective operator related to the linear part of Maxwell's equations has a
spectral gap about $0$. We also give examples of material coefficients,
including nonperiodic materials, where such a spectral gap is present.

Motivation: To generalize existing mathematical results from previous work to the more complex p-Laplacian operator case, specifically addressing coupled local and nonlocal operators.

Method: Couples local p-Laplacian with nonlocal p-Laplacian through source terms, analyzes the resulting energy functional, and uses direct minimization approach to prove solution properties.

Result: Established existence and uniqueness of solutions for the coupled p-Laplacian problem through energy functional minimization.

Conclusion: Successfully extended previous mathematical framework to handle p-Laplacian operators with both local and nonlocal coupling, providing rigorous existence and uniqueness proofs.

Abstract: In this paper we extend some results presented in \cite{julio} to the case of
the $p$-Laplacian operator. More precisely, we consider a model that couples a
local $p$-Laplacian operator with a nonlocal $p$-Laplacian operator through
source terms in the equation. The resulting problem is associated with an
energy functional. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution,
which is obtained via the direct minimization of the corresponding energy
functional.

Motivation: To enable rapid multiscale homogenization of heterogeneous plate structures with periodic micro-structures while maintaining accuracy and reducing computational costs.

Handles both linear/nonlinear problems in classical plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory.

Result: The model matches FFT-based direct numerical simulation accuracy while reducing computational cost by over an order of magnitude. Verified on linear isotropic perforated plates, woven composites, and non-linear elasto-plastic cases with damage.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and accurate reduced-order modeling approach for multiscale analysis of heterogeneous plate structures with significant computational savings.

Abstract: This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic
micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of

Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online
self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference
medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical
plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is
verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as
on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with
damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based

Motivation: To understand how structured patterns in nature can arise through complexity rather than linear instability theory, particularly in coupled systems like astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.

Method: Simulating ensembles of oscillators with phase synchronization through a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field to study spectral characteristics of spontaneous structures.

Result: The spectral density of emergent structures shows universal scaling laws that align with natural observations, demonstrating complex physical interactions can be achieved through self-organization principles.

Conclusion: Spontaneously generated structures provide alternative explanations to reductionist approaches for observed structures in coupled plasma systems, suggesting self-organization as a fundamental principle.

Abstract: Self-organized turbulence represents a way for structuring in nature to arise
through sheer complexity rather than through linear instability theory.
Simulating ensembles of oscillators that undergo phase synchronization through
a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field, we present the spectral
characteristics of spontaneous, self-organized structures of locally coupled
oscillators. We demonstrate that the spectral density of emergent structures
can exhibit universal scaling laws, in line with expectations from nature,
indicating that observed statistical outcomes of complex physical interactions
can be achieved through a more general principle of self-organization. We
suggest that spontaneously generated structures may provide nuance to the
reigning reductionist explanations for the observed structure in coupled
systems of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces.

Method: Developed a self-consistent model based on spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume, cyclotron rotation of plasma ions, and analysis of both cyclotron rotation and rigid rotor hydrodynamic models.

Result: Extracted Gaussian-shaped radial magnetic field distribution for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. Found cyclotron rotations dominate the process with profound resonance enrichment for specific charge states due to Ion Bernstein Wave coupling.

Conclusion: The magnetic centrifuge mechanism and cyclotron rotation of ions (not hydrodynamic rotation) are the primary drivers of nickel isotope enrichment in laser ablation plumes, with resonant effects enhanced by Ion Bernstein Wave coupling.

Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large
enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser
irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation
of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron
rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per
second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical
symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian
shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with
peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to
cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is
associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to
be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations
dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for
specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion
Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these
resonant orbits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the hypothesis that shock-shock collisions in stellar clusters could explain high-energy cosmic ray spectra through additional particle acceleration.

Method: Laser-based experiment creating magnetized plasma conditions similar to astrophysical environments, combined with numerical kinetic simulations.

Result: Interpenetrating collisionless shocks significantly boost ambient proton energy and improve acceleration efficiency; protons are reaccelerated via bouncing motion in convective electric fields.

Conclusion: The colliding-shock platform provides a controlled laboratory setting to test diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms for cosmic ray origins.

Abstract: Although the origin of cosmic rays (CRs) remains an open question,
collisionless magnetized shock waves are widely regarded as key sites for
particle acceleration. Recent theories further suggest that shock-shock
collisions in stellar clusters could provide the additional acceleration needed
to explain the observed high-energy CR spectrum. Here, we investigate this
hypothesis through a laser-based experiment that creates magnetized plasma
conditions similar to astrophysical environments. Our results demonstrate that
interpenetrating collisionless shocks can significantly boost the energy of
ambient protons previously energized by the individual shocks, while also
improving the overall acceleration efficiency. Numerical kinetic simulations
corroborate these findings, revealing that protons are reaccelerated via their
bouncing motion in the convective electric fields of the colliding magnetized
flows. By allowing to highly energize ambient protons, our novel
colliding-shock platform opens the prospect to test the long-discussed
mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration in a controlled laboratory setting.

Method: Used FLUKA code with realistic RE energy distributions from ASDEX Upgrade experiment to simulate impacts, then developed finite element thermal model in FreeFem++ to analyze thermal response using volumetric energy density profiles

Result: Found clear relationship between beam impact angle and deposited energy - higher angles lead to deeper penetration and greater energy deposition. Different RE current values significantly influence material temperature evolution and melting thickness

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative analysis of RE damage mechanisms on first wall materials, showing Tungsten and Beryllium respond differently to RE impacts, with implications for fusion reactor material selection and design

Abstract: The study assessed the damage caused by Runaway Electrons (RE) on First Wall
tiles, comparing the effects on Beryllium and Tungsten. This was done by using
realistic RE energy distribution functions to replicate RE impacts through the
FLUKA code. These energy distribution functions are based on the ASDEX Upgrade
experiment # 39012. The parametric analysis carried out with FLUKA in the
presence of magnetic fields indicated a clear relationship between the beam
impact angle and the material deposited energy, demonstrating that higher
impact angles lead to deeper electron penetration and greater deposited
energies. A finite element model based on apparent heat capacity formulation in
FreeFem++ was developed to analyze the material thermal response to such
thermal loads using volumetric energy density profiles from FLUKA simulations
as input. Different RE current values were simulated to show its influence on
the evolution of the material temperature and melting thickness

TL;DR: Monte Carlo simulation method for calculating incoherent Thomson scattering spectra in high-temperature plasmas using macro-particles and random sampling from electron distribution functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient computational method for calculating incoherent Thomson scattering spectra that can handle arbitrary electron distribution functions with reasonable computational cost.

Method: Treats scattering as superposition of individual photon-electron interactions, uses macro-particles from particle-in-cell simulations to reduce computational cost, and randomly samples electron velocities from distribution functions.

Result: Simulated spectra for relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results.

Conclusion: The Monte Carlo simulation method reliably reproduces incoherent Thomson scattering spectra and can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions with appropriate sampling.

Abstract: We developed a Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate incoherent Thomson
scattering spectra in high temperature plasmas. The basic idea is to treat the
entire scattering process as the superposition of individual photon-electron
interactions. We introduce macro-particles, referred from particle-in-cell
simulations, to reduce the computational cost, and obtain scattered spectra
within a reasonable computational time. Since the velocity of the interacting
electron is randomly sampled from an electron distribution function, the method
can be applied to arbitrary electron distribution functions provided an
appropriate sampling scheme is available. We present simulation results for
relativistic Maxwellian and kappa distribution functions, and compare them with
both analytical and numerical spectra for validation. The simulated spectra
show good agreement with both analytical and numerical results, demonstrating
that the Monte Carlo simulation method can reliably reproduce incoherent
Thomson scattering spectra.

TL;DR: Machine learning framework using neural network surrogates trained on 1D and 2D simulations to optimize inertial fusion designs robust to hydrodynamic instabilities, achieving high gain for laser drivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inertial fusion design requires balancing computational efficiency (1D simulations) with accuracy in capturing hydrodynamic instabilities (expensive 2D simulations). Current methods rely heavily on optimistic 1D designs that may not account for instability effects.

Method: Developed ensemble neural network surrogate models trained on both 1D and 2D simulation data to identify robust designs. Used Bayesian optimization with the surrogate to find optimal designs for 25 kJ laser driver, then performed hydrodynamic scaling to 2 MJ driver.

Result: Successfully identified optimal designs that are robust to hydrodynamic instabilities. Achieved high gain for 2 MJ laser driver using 2D simulations that include alpha heating effects.

Conclusion: The machine learning framework effectively bridges the gap between computationally cheap 1D simulations and expensive 2D simulations, enabling efficient identification of robust inertial fusion designs that maintain performance under realistic hydrodynamic instability conditions.

Abstract: The design of inertial fusion experiments is a complex task as driver energy
must be delivered in a precise manner to a structured target to achieve a fast,
but hydrodynamically stable, implosion. Radiation-hydrodynamics simulation
codes are an essential tool in this design process. However, multi-dimensional
simulations that capture hydrodynamic instabilities are more computationally
expensive than optimistic, 1D, spherically symmetric simulations which are
often the primary design tool. In this work, we develop a machine learning
framework that aims to effectively use information from a large number of 1D
simulations to inform design in the presence of hydrodynamic instabilities. We
use an ensemble of neural network surrogate models trained on both 1D and 2D
data to capture the space of good designs, i.e. those that are robust to
hydrodynamic instabilities. We use this surrogate to perform Bayesian
optimisation to find optimal designs for a 25 kJ laser driver. We perform
hydrodynamic scaling on these designs to confirm the achievement of high gain
for a 2 MJ laser driver, using 2D simulations including alpha heating effects.

TL;DR: Molecular dynamics simulations reveal how hydrophobic rubber enhances ice premelting by disrupting water structure while suppressing water mobility through confinement, creating a mixed rubber-water interface near melting point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the molecular tribology of ice-rubber interfaces is critical for applications like tires and shoe outsoles, but the fundamental mechanisms remain unclear.

Method: All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of styrene-butadiene rubber in contact with basal face of ice across temperatures from 254 to 269 K.

Result: Rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water (promoting premelting) but suppresses water mobility through confinement. Near melting point, rubber chains penetrate premelting layer forming mixed rubber-water region that couples dynamics.

Conclusion: Nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks to enhance premelting, providing insights for designing polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.

Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe
outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in
contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its
hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water,
promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement
from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor
interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and
penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that
couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale
roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond
networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level
insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with
controlled ice adhesion and friction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using laser-plasma accelerator-generated VHEE beams for radiotherapy, addressing limitations of traditional photon-based approaches with enhanced dose distribution capabilities.

Method: Used particle-in-cell simulations for laser-plasma interaction, filtered/collimated beams with beamline, arranged into pencil beam arrays, and conducted GEANT4 simulations for dose deposition in water and heterogeneous phantoms with multifield irradiation setups.

Result: Polychromatic VHEE beams from laser-plasma accelerators can deliver on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity when collimated using compact beamline of quadrupoles and dipoles.

Conclusion: Laser-plasma accelerators show transformative potential for advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and clinical implementation.

Abstract: Radiotherapy using very high-energy electron (VHEE) beams generated by a
laser-plasma accelerator has garnered significant interest due to its dose
distribution capabilities and potential to address limitations of traditional
photon-based radiotherapy. To explore the feasibility of such approach, the
presented study uses the parameters of OONA, the commercial <1.3\,J, <25\,fs
pulse duration laser recently installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
Through particle-in-cell simulations of laser-plasma interaction, realistic
electron beams were obtained. After filtering and collimation with a beamline
and arranging them into an array of pencil beams, their radiotherapeutic
potential was investigated. GEANT4 simulations were used to calculate the dose
deposition in water phantoms and heterogeneous phantoms with bone inserts,
considering realistic beam parameters for laser-plasma accelerators. Multifield
irradiation setup and the dose distribution at the isocenter through different
incidence angles were studied, simulating an intensity-modulated delivery. Our
findings demonstrate that polychromatic VHEE beams generated from laser-plasma
accelerators, when collimated using a compact beamline of quadrupoles and
dipoles, can deliver an on-axis dose with enhanced precision and uniformity.
This study highlights the transformative potential of laser-plasma accelerators
in advancing radiotherapy modalities, paving the way for further research and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting microscopic tumor spread invisible on diagnostic imaging by developing a model that captures histologically observed tumor islet behavior in prostate cancer.

Method: Three-event model (cell movement, duplication, death) with Ising-like Hamiltonian capturing neighbor correlations. Parameters fitted to surgical specimen data from 23 prostate cancer patients.

Result: Model effectively describes tumor islet size/number distributions and produces regularly shaped spherical islets that mimic histological observations, with Ising interactions acting as surface tension.

Conclusion: The straightforward physical model successfully addresses clinical needs for calculating tumor involvement probabilities in specific prostate sub-volumes for radiation treatment planning.

Abstract: A major challenge in diagnosing and treating cancer is the infiltrative
growth of tumors into surrounding tissues.
  This microscopic spread of the disease is invisible on most diagnostic
imaging modalities and can often only be detected histologically in biopsies.
  The purpose of this paper is to develop a physically based model of tumor
spread that captures the histologically observed behavior in terms of seeding
small tumor islets in prostate cancer.
  The model is based on three elementary events: a tumor cell can move,
duplicate, or die.
  The propensity of each event is given by an Ising-like Hamiltonian that
captures correlations between neighboring cells.
  The model parameters were fitted to clinical data obtained from surgical
specimens taken from 23 prostate cancer patients.
  The results demonstrate that this straightforward physical model effectively
describes the distribution of the size and the number of tumor islets in
prostate cancer.
  The simulated tumor islets exhibit a regular, approximately spherical shape,
correctly mimicking the shapes observed in histology.
  This is due to the Ising interaction term between neighboring cells acting as
a surface tension that gives rise to regularly shaped islets.
  The model addresses the important clinical need of calculating the
probability of tumor involvement in specific sub-volumes of the prostate, which
is required for radiation treatment planning and other applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel agent framework using three LLMs (Consultant, Reviewer, Programmer) in a collaborative 'rewriting-resolution-review-revision' chain for scientific computing code generation, significantly improving bug-free code rates and reducing non-physical solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generating reliable, bug-free code for scientific computing problems from natural language descriptions by leveraging collaborative reasoning among multiple LLMs rather than relying on single models.

Method: Three-agent framework with Consultant (knowledge transfer and text augmentation), Programmer (code generation/execution), and Reviewer (self-debugging/refinement through interactive feedback). Uses end-to-end review mechanism for iterative code revision.

Result: Significantly improved bug-free code generation rate and reduced occurrence of non-physical solutions compared to single-model approaches. Enhanced execution success rates for solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems.

Conclusion: The collaborative multi-agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising paradigm for scientific computing, providing highly reliable autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address eigenvalue crossings in Dirac-type operators and extend Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization to 2x2 systems where previous scalar formulations are insufficient.

Method: Builds on earlier work on scalar Bohr-Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of Harper operator, deriving additional contributions to quantization condition for general self-adjoint 2x2 systems.

Result: Derived concise expressions for quantization conditions with explicit geometric phase corrections, clarifying when these phases take quantized values.

Conclusion: Provides a complete formulation that handles eigenvalue crossings in phase space, offering geometric insights into quantization conditions for 2x2 semiclassical systems.

Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld
quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the
real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the
case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain
enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type
operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and
semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we
identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive
concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The
resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when
these phases take quantized values.

*B. L. Alterman*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux can predict fastest speeds observed near Earth, with Alfvén wave forcing identified as the primary acceleration mechanism during interplanetary propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early solar wind acceleration models cannot account for the fastest non-transient solar wind speeds observed near-Earth, requiring identification of the energy deposition mechanisms and their dependence on source region topology.

Method: Used near-Sun observations of solar wind's kinetic energy flux to predict expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth, applied a recently developed model of solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere to analyze acceleration mechanisms.

Result: The solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest non-transient speeds observed near Earth, with continuous energy deposition by Alfvén wave forcing identified as the primary acceleration mechanism during interplanetary propagation.

Conclusion: Alfvén wave forcing during solar wind propagation is a consequence of source region topology, allowing statistical mapping of near-Earth observations to their source regions using the solar wind's Alfvénicity.

Abstract: Broadly, solar wind source regions can be classified by their magnetic
topology as intermittently and continuously open to the heliosphere. Early
models of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient
solar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the
solar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\'en wave energy deposition and thermal
pressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each
acceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind
speed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously
identify source region topology.
  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we
predict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic
energy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast
solar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is
sufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds
observed near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind
evolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required
to generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to
the continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\'en wave forcing during the solar
wind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's
Alfv\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source
regions because the Alfv\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in
transit is a consequence of the source region topology.

Result: Numerical results from real-world experiments and PDE-related scientific problems support the VC metric's effectiveness and the preprocessing acceleration method.

Conclusion: VC provides quantifiable insights into neural network approximation stability and performance, with identified trends and preprocessing framework offering practical improvements for reliability.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related

Motivation: Motivated by the finite-gap structure of the classical Lamé equation and its importance in mathematical physics, the paper investigates generalized Lamé-type equations to establish deeper mathematical connections and applications.

Method: Establishes monodromy equivalence between classical Lamé equation and generalized Lamé-type equation for the fundamental case n=1. Uses this equivalence to derive finite-gap structure and classify spectral curves for τ ∈ iℝ>0.

Result: Obtained complete classification of spectral curves σ₁ and σ₂. Applied monodromy equivalence to construct cone spherical metrics with three large conical singularities (each with cone angle > 2π). Showed that a family of such metrics exhibits a blow-up configuration described explicitly in terms of monodromy data.

Conclusion: The monodromy equivalence provides a powerful tool for understanding finite-gap structures and enables explicit construction of geometric objects (cone spherical metrics) with specific singularity properties, revealing blow-up configurations through monodromy data analysis.

Abstract: Motivated by the finite-gap structure of the classical Lam\'{e} equation

equations (1.12) are investigated. For the fundamental case $n=1$, a monodromy
equivalence between the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.18) and the generalized
Lam\'{e}-type equation (1.19) is established. Two main applications are
obtained: (i) the finite-gap structure of \ (1.19) is derived, together with a
complete classification of the spectral curves $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$
for $\tau\in i\mathbb{R}_{>0}$; and (ii) the monodromy equivalence is applied
to the construction of cone spherical metrics with three large conical

is shown to exhibits a blow-up configuration, which is described explicitly in
terms of the monodromy data.

Motivation: To create a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model for large-scale industrial applications that can accurately reconstruct full temperature fields from both numerical and experimental data, specifically for domestic refrigerator analysis.

Method: Combined Artificial Neural Network with Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method. Used Conjugated Heat Transfer method at full-order level to study air circulation and heat transfer. Conducted parametric studies on ambient temperature, fan velocity, and evaporator temperature.

Result: Achieved prediction error of 1 degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000x, even with very sparse training datasets. Outperformed conventional GPOD approach in large-scale industrial applications.

Conclusion: The ANN-enhanced GPOD method provides a stable and efficient approach for temperature field reconstruction in industrial applications, offering significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The current study aims to develop a non-intrusive Reduced Order Model (ROM)
to reconstruct the full temperature field for a large-scale industrial
application based on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed
approach is validated against a domestic refrigerator. At the full order level,
air circulation and heat transfer in fluid and between fluid and surrounding
solids in the fridge were numerically studied using the Conjugated Heat
Transfer (CHT) method to explore both the natural and forced convection-based
fridge model followed by a parametric study-based on the ambient temperature,
fridge fan velocity, and evaporator temperature. The main novelty of the
current work is the introduction of a stable Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
enhanced Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (GPOD) method which shows better
performance than the conventional GPOD approach in such large-scale industrial
applications. The full-order model is validated with the experimental results
and the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model associated with different
reduced-order approaches is compared with the benchmark numerical results or
high-fidelity results. In our current work, we show that a prediction error of
one degree centigrade and computational speed-up of 5000 is achieved even at a

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Machine learning can predict final topological defect configurations from early order parameter evolution near critical points, following Kibble-Zurek mechanism scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism suggests topological defect formation is determined early in phase transitions, motivating investigation of whether machine learning can predict final defect configurations from early-stage data.

Method: Used a Recurrent Neural Network to analyze the time evolution of the order parameter during a short interval near the critical point of second-order phase transitions.

Result: Machine learning successfully predicts final topological defect configurations based on early order parameter evolution, and this predictability follows the same power law scaling as dictated by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

Conclusion: ML can accurately forecast topological defect outcomes from limited early data, demonstrating that defect formation patterns are encoded in the initial dynamics near critical points, consistent with KZM predictions.

Abstract: According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological
defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the
correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final
configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely
established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is
traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can
predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time
evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the
critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new
minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that
the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We
demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and validate the Lee-Yang-zero ratio method as an alternative approach for precisely locating critical points in statistical physics models, particularly addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model combined with the Lee-Yang-zero ratio method, comparing it with the conventional Binder-cumulant method.

Result: The LYZR method proved equally powerful as Binder-cumulant method for critical point determination, with superior suppression of finite-size scaling violations and non-linearity near criticality. Precise universal values of LYZRs were obtained.

Conclusion: The Lee-Yang-zero ratio method is a robust alternative for critical point analysis, offering advantages over traditional methods, and a single-zero variant also shows promise for critical point searches.

Abstract: By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model,
we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine
the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR
method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying
the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the
violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point.
We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the
critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an
alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is
also useful for the search for the critical point.

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: The paper extends the Hasse principle from number theory to geometric analysis, showing that area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully determined from real and mod n homology information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge concepts from number theory (Hasse principle) to geometric variational problems, specifically understanding how information about area-minimizing submanifolds can be reconstructed from different coefficient systems.

Method: The authors demonstrate that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds by showing that integral homology information can be completely recovered from real homology and mod n homology data for all n ≥ 2.

Result: Several surprising conclusions: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod n homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected, and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated.

Conclusion: The Hasse principle likely applies to all geometric variational problems formulated on chain spaces over different coefficients, including Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, spherical Plateau problems, and minimizers of elliptic functionals.

Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral
solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions
and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for
area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in
integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod
$n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive
several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod
$n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing
submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse
principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated
on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean
curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and
other general functionals, etc.

Conclusion: Continuous microwave radiation enables rapid barium titanate synthesis through localized thermal effects, with numerical modeling confirming high power absorption efficiency in specific domains.

Abstract: This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of
barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in
a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where
fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation
within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium
carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 -
7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed
realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative
solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is
demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale
thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave
power of 400 W.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create versatile molecular building blocks for realizing exotic quantum phases using pure carbon fullerene molecules

Method: Using charge neutral C40 fullerene molecules to form effective spin-1/2 clusters arranged in 2D rutile-like crystal structure within Shastry-Sutherland lattice

Result: Achieved d-wave splitting of spin-polarized electronic band structure, strong chiral-split magnon bands, and demonstrated tunable phases including altermagnetic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases via bi-axial strains

Conclusion: Magnetic fullerene monolayers serve as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications

Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic
quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an
example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland
lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective
spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into
a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show
$d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong
chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters
form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including
altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be
easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic
fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and
spintronic applications.

### [51] [Spectral Gaps with Quantum Counting Queries and Oblivious State Preparation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21002)
*Almudena Carrera Vazquez,Aleksandros Sobczyk*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for approximating spectral gaps with logarithmic qubits and quadratic complexity in N, providing speed-up over classical methods for large gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximating spectral gaps is crucial for many scientific and engineering applications, but classical algorithms have high complexity (O(N^ω)). Quantum computing offers potential speed-up.

Method: Uses quantum algorithm with random initial state preparation to efficiently count eigenvalues below threshold. Operates in QRAM model with polylogarithmic complexity factors.

Result: Achieves additive error εΔ_k approximation with complexity O(N²/ε²Δ_k² polylog(N,1/Δ_k,1/ε,1/δ)), providing speed-up over classical O(N^ω) for large spectral gaps.

Conclusion: Quantum algorithm enables efficient spectral gap approximation with quadratic complexity in N, demonstrating quantum advantage for this important eigenproblem.

Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$
and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an
$N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues
$\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case
of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In
this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to
additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits.
Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded
by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where
$\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability,
respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the
best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left(
N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left(
N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim
2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the
analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which
ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are
smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In
the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound
for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric)
matrix.

### [52] [On the Regulation of the Solar Wind Helium Abundance by the Hydrogen Compressibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20391)
*B. L. Alterman,R. D'Amicis*

Main category: physics.space-ph

TL;DR: Solar wind helium abundance behavior differs between fast and slow wind, with unexpected large gradients in fast wind linked to compressive fluctuations and non-Alfvenic cross helicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unexpected relationship between solar wind helium abundance gradients and cross helicity in fast solar wind, challenging traditional views of solar wind origins.

Method: Analysis of solar wind compressibility (|δn/n|) and cross helicity (|σc|) to identify subsets of enhanced helium abundance and their relationship to solar wind sources.

Result: Found two subsets of enhanced helium abundance: one with large compressibility from non-traditional sources, and another in Alfven wave-poor wind. Established upper bounds: |σc| ≲ 0.65 for non-Alfvenic cross helicity and |δn/n| ≲ 0.15 for incompressible fluctuations.

Conclusion: Compressibility (|δn/n|) is essential for characterizing and possibly regulating solar wind helium abundance, providing new insights into solar wind origins beyond traditional fast/slow wind dichotomy.

Abstract: Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source
regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates
in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of
the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind
speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$) is $\sim0$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\sim50\%$
of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large,
$A_\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\sim50\%$
value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches
1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that
$\nabla_{v_\mathrm{sw}} \! A_\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases
with decreasing $\left|\sigma_c\right|$. We show that these large gradients are
due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar
wind's compressibility ($\left|\delta n/n\right|$), there are two subsets of
enhanced $A_\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with
a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently
open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these
fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\'en
wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely
analogous to the Alfv\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to
Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given
$\left|\delta n/n\right|$ quantile, $\left|\sigma_c\right| \lesssim 0.65$, an
upper bound on non-Alfv\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\left|\delta
n/n\right| \lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ quantile, is an
upper bound on incompressible fluctuations. We conclude that $\left|\delta
n/n\right|$ is essential for characterizing the solar wind helium abundance and
possibly regulating it.
