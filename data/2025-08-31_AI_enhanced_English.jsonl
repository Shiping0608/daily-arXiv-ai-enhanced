In fast wind, the gradient of\nthe solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind\nspeed ($v_\\mathrm{sw}$) is $\\sim0$ and $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\\sim50\\%$\nof the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large,\n$A_\\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\\sim50\\%$\nvalue. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches\n1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that\n$\\nabla_{v_\\mathrm{sw}} \\! A_\\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases\nwith decreasing $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$. We show that these large gradients are\ndue to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar\nwind's compressibility ($\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$), there are two subsets of\nenhanced $A_\\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with\na large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently\nopen sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these\nfluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\\'en\nwave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely\nanalogous to the Alfv\\'enic slow wind.

Similarly, $\\left|\\delta\nn/n\\right| \\lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$ quantile, is an\nupper bound on incompressible fluctuations.
