Recently, a\nnew strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity\npreserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in\norder to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity\npreserving scheme.

Both Runge-Kutta and Adams-Bashforth methods are reformulated to\npreserve physical properties of the density matrix throughout evolution. This\nlow-rank algorithm enables simulations of much larger spin systems, which were\npreviously infeasible, providing a powerful tool for comparing q-LL and q-LLG\ndynamics, testing each model validity, and probing how quantum features such as\ncorrelations and entanglement evolve across different regimes of system size\nand damping."}

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This\nwork establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for\ncreating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically\ncombining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures."}

In practice, one often\nemploys stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural\nnetwork. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is\nof fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of\nstochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer\nPINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high\nprobability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient\ndescent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the\ndynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of\nthe analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram\nmatrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of\nthe optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks\ntrained by stochastic algorithms."}
