In this work, the impacts of magnetic geometry and\ndivertor target geometry in the four types of SF configurations on plasma\nbehavior and power exhaust performance are investigated in detail.\nLow-recycling regime, high-recycling and detachment in the four types of SF\ndivertors are obtained through an upstream density scan.

It describes the breaking\nand joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy\nand the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast\nreconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying\nsuch reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions\nremains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying\nmagnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply\nbifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that\nthey can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection\nconfigurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of\nquasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical\nsimulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate,\nobtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized\nvalue 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current\nsheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second\ninvariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional\nreliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new\nperspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with\ncomplex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation\nmodels, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of\nmagnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments."}
