### [1] [Stabilization-free virtual element method for 2D third medium contact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03630)
*Bing-Bing Xu,Peter Wriggers*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: SFVEM enables third medium contact simulation without stabilization terms, simplifying complex contact problems with large deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Third medium contact avoids complex contact constraints but traditional VEM requires stabilization terms and second-order schemes, making implementation difficult.

Method: Developed stabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) that eliminates need for additional stabilization terms, simplifies regularization term construction, and builds on second-order FEM framework with high-order projection operators.

Result: SFVEM successfully applied to solve complex 2D third medium contact problems, demonstrating effectiveness and applicability through numerical examples.

Conclusion: SFVEM provides a simplified and effective approach for third medium contact problems, overcoming limitations of traditional VEM while maintaining flexibility for arbitrary polygonal elements.

Abstract: The third medium contact has been proven to be an effective approach for
simulating contact problems involving large deformations. Unlike traditional
contact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between
two contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact
constraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different
applications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a
generalization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)
can handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for
modeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the
projection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the
rank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third
medium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which
further complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the
stabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to
solve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM,
SFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the
construction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon
the traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of
SFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of
high-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of
SFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deep learning method for solving PDEs that eliminates the need for computing derivatives of the solution neural network, making it more efficient and suitable for complex PDE problems.

Method: Uses weak adversarial formulation with random difference operators applied to test functions instead of the solution network, creating a fully derivative-free framework.

Result: The method is particularly well-suited for second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, providing an efficient alternative to traditional derivative-based approaches.

Conclusion: ARDO offers a novel derivative-free deep learning framework for PDE solving that shows particular promise for Fokker-Planck equations and similar second-order PDE problems.

Abstract: We propose ARDO method for solving PDEs and PDE-related problems with deep
learning techniques. This method uses a weak adversarial formulation but
transfers the random difference operator onto the test function. The main
advantage of this framework is that it is fully derivative-free with respect to
the solution neural network. This framework is particularly suitable for
Fokker-Planck type second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

*Ting Li,Bin Wang,Ruili Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Two-step symmetric methods for relativistic charged-particle dynamics that preserve geometric structures like energy, mass shell, and phase-space volume, with second-order accuracy and long-time conservation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop numerical methods that preserve important geometric structures in relativistic charged-particle dynamics, including energy conservation, mass shell preservation, and phase-space volume conservation, which are crucial for long-term simulation accuracy.

Method: Developed four two-step symmetric numerical methods based on splitting schemes. One method exactly preserves mass shell and phase-space volume, while three modified methods achieve long-time near-conservation of energy and mass shell through backward error analysis.

Result: All methods achieve second-order accuracy. The first method exactly preserves mass shell and phase-space volume, while the modified methods demonstrate rigorous long-time near-conservation of energy and mass shell. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: The proposed two-step symmetric methods effectively preserve geometric structures in relativistic charged-particle dynamics, with proven second-order accuracy and long-time conservation properties, making them suitable for accurate long-term simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the error estimates and the long-time conservation
or near-conservation of geometric structures, including energy, mass shell and
phase-space volume, for four two-step symmetric methods applied to relativistic
charged-particle dynamics. We begin by introducing a two-step symmetric
numerical method based on a splitting scheme that exactly preserves the mass
shell and the phase-space volume of the relativistic system. Building on this
formulation, we develop three additional two-step symmetric methods with
further modifications, for which the long-time near-conservation of energy and
mass shell can be rigorously established through the backward error analysis.
All methods are shown to achieve second-order accuracy. The theoretical results
are illustrated and complemented by numerical experiments.

### [4] [Fluid boundary conditions in kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03942)
*Thijs Steel,Vince Maes,Giovanni Samaey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Extended KDMC method handles boundary conditions without switching to slower pure kinetic methods, achieving 500x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original KDMC method requires switching to slower pure kinetic methods when simulating particles near boundaries, creating performance bottlenecks.

Method: Extended the Kinetic-Diffusion Monte Carlo method to accurately incorporate boundary conditions while maintaining the hybrid fluid-kinetic approach, eliminating the need for switching to pure kinetic methods.

Result: Experiments demonstrated up to 500 times speedup compared to the original KDMC method that switches to pure kinetic methods, with minimal sacrifice in accuracy.

Conclusion: The extended KDMC method successfully addresses boundary condition challenges while maintaining the performance advantages of hybrid fluid-kinetic simulation for neutral particles in fusion reactors.

Abstract: The Kinetic-Diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) method is a powerful tool for
simulating neutral particles in fusion reactors. It is a hybrid fluid-kinetic
method that is significantly faster than pure kinetic methods at the cost of a
small bias due to fluid approximations. Unfortunately, when simulating
particles close to a boundary, it needs to switch to a purely kinetic method,
which is significantly slower. In this paper, we will extend the method so that
it can accurately take boundary conditions into account without switching to a
purely kinetic method. Experiments show that this extension can lead to a
speedup of up to 500 times compared to a KDMC method that switches to a purely
kinetic method, while not sacrificing too much accuracy.

### [5] [A unified stabilized virtual element method for the generalized Oseen equation: stability and robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04113)
*Sudheer Mishra,E Natarajan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel local projection stabilized virtual element method for generalized Oseen problem using equal-order elements on polygonal meshes, providing stability and optimal error estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable numerical method for generalized Oseen problems that handles convection-dominated regimes and equal-order element pairs on general polygonal meshes, overcoming stability issues in traditional approaches.

Method: Local projection based stabilization techniques for conforming virtual element method using equal-order element pairs on polygonal meshes, ensuring discrete inf-sup condition in energy norm.

Result: Method demonstrates stability for convection-dominated regimes, provides optimal error estimates with uniform convergence for small diffusion cases, and remains valid for Brinkman and Stokes equations. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed local projection stabilization offers advantages including simplicity, easier implementation than residual-based methods, no coupling between element pairs, and quasi-robust parameter performance, making it effective for generalized Oseen problems.

Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate a novel local projection based stabilized
conforming virtual element method for the generalized Oseen problem using
equal-order element pairs on general polygonal meshes. To ensure the stability,
particularly in the presence of convection-dominated regimes and the
utilization of equal-order element pairs, we introduce local projections based
stabilization techniques. We demonstrate the discrete inf-sup condition in the
energy norm. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method also guarantees the
stability properties for the Brinkman equation and the Stokes equation without
introducing any additional conditions. Furthermore, we derive an optimal error
estimates in the energy norm that underline the uniform convergence in the
energy norm for the generalized Oseen problem with small diffusion. In
addition, the error estimates remain valid and uniform for the Brinkman
equation and the Stokes equation. Additionally, the convergence study shows
that the proposed method is quasi-robust with respect to parameters. The
proposed method offers several advantages, including simplicity in
construction, easier implementation compared to residual-based stabilization
techniques, and avoiding coupling between element pairs. We validate our
theoretical findings through a series of numerical experiments, including
diffusion-dominated and convection-dominated regimes.

### [6] [A posteriori error estimates and space-adaptive mesh refinements for time-dependent scattering problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04217)
*Théophile Chaumont-Frelet,Heiko Gimperlein,Ignacio Labarca-Figueroa,Jörg Nick*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A posteriori error analysis and adaptive mesh refinement for time-dependent acoustic scattering problems using boundary integral equations with convolution quadrature method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable error estimators and adaptive mesh refinement strategies for time-dependent acoustic scattering problems, improving computational efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Discretization using convolution quadrature method in time and boundary elements in space, with residual-type error estimator and space-adaptive mesh refinements. Modified convolution quadrature with temporal shifts to recover optimal convergence rates.

Result: Proved reliability of residual error estimator, achieved full classical temporal convergence order 2m-1 for boundary densities, and observed asymptotically optimal meshes in 2D acoustic scattering problems.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheme with modified convolution quadrature provides reliable error control and optimal mesh refinement for time-dependent acoustic scattering simulations.

Abstract: This work studies a posteriori error estimates and their use for
time-dependent acoustic scattering problems, formulated as a time-dependent
boundary integral equation based on a single-layer ansatz. The integral
equation is discretized by the convolution quadrature method in time and by
boundary elements in space. We prove the reliability of an error estimator of
residual type and study the resulting space-adaptive mesh refinements.
Moreover, we present a simple modification of the convolution quadrature method
based on temporal shifts, which recovers, for the boundary densities, the full
classical temporal convergence order $2m-1$ of the temporal convolution
quadrature method based on the $m$-stage convolution quadrature
semi-discretization. We numerically observe that the adaptive scheme yields
asymptotically optimal meshes for an acoustic scattering problem in two
dimensions.

### [7] [An explicit splitting SAV scheme for the kinetic Langevin dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04251)
*Lei Dai,Yingsong Jiang,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel explicit splitting scalar auxiliary variable (SSAV) scheme for kinetic Langevin dynamics that handles non-globally Lipschitz continuous gradients with superlinear growth, providing order-one strong convergence and effective sampling of invariant distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kinetic Langevin dynamics has important applications in molecular dynamics and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, but existing methods struggle with non-globally Lipschitz continuous gradients that have superlinear growth. There is a need for efficient and robust explicit schemes that can reproduce the energy structure of the original dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a splitting scalar auxiliary variable (SSAV) scheme, which is an explicit method that maintains the energy structure of the original dynamics. The method uses an energy argument to prove exponential integrability and establishes order-one strong convergence without requiring global monotonicity conditions.

Result: The SSAV scheme demonstrates polynomial growth of moments with respect to time length, enabling weak error estimates of order one with polynomial (not exponential) dependence on time. Despite polynomial growth, the explicit scheme remains computationally effective for approximating invariant distributions with exponential ergodicity.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and show the superiority of the SSAV algorithm in sampling applications. The method provides an efficient, robust explicit scheme for kinetic Langevin dynamics with non-globally Lipschitz continuous gradients.

Abstract: The kinetic Langevin dynamics finds diverse applications in various
disciplines such as molecular dynamics and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. In
this paper, a novel splitting scalar auxiliary variable (SSAV) scheme is
proposed for the dynamics, where the gradient of the potential $U$ is possibly
non-globally Lipschitz continuous with superlinear growth. As an explicit
scheme, the SSAV method is efficient, robust and is able to reproduce the
energy structure of the original dynamics. By an energy argument, the SSAV
scheme is proved to possess an exponential integrability property, which is
crucial to establishing the order-one strong convergence without the global
monotonicity condition. Moreover, moments of the numerical approximations are
shown to have polynomial growth with respect to the time length. This helps us
to obtain weak error estimates of order one, with error constants polynomially
(not exponentially) depending on the time length. Despite the obtained
polynomial growth, the explicit scheme is shown to be computationally effective
for the approximation of the invariant distribution of the dynamics with
exponential ergodicity. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the
theoretical findings and to show the superiority of the algorithm in sampling.

### [8] [Error analysis for learning the time-stepping operator of evolutionary PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04256)
*Ke Chen,Meenakshi Krishnan,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Theoretical framework for analyzing neural network approximation of PDE time-stepping operators with explicit error bounds and generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical PDE solvers face stability-computational cost tradeoffs, while DNNs offer data-driven alternatives for learning time-stepping operators directly.

Method: Rigorous theoretical analysis of feedforward neural networks approximating time-stepping operators, deriving error estimates based on network architecture and training samples, establishing Lipschitz continuity and low-complexity structures.

Result: Explicit error estimates showing dependence on network width/depth and training samples, generalization bounds demonstrating efficient learnability without curse of dimensionality for various PDE classes.

Conclusion: Theoretical framework provides foundation for neural network-based PDE solving with proven approximation capabilities and generalization performance across multiple PDE types.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as effective tools for
approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs)
including evolutionary problems. Classical numerical solvers for such PDEs
often face challenges of balancing stability constraints and the high
computational cost of iterative solvers. In contrast, DNNs offer a data-driven
alternative through direct learning of time-stepping operators to achieve this
balancing goal. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical framework for
analyzing the approximation of these operators using feedforward neural
networks (FNNs). We derive explicit error estimates that characterize the
dependence of the approximation error on the network architecture -- namely its
width and depth -- as well as the number of training samples. Furthermore, we
establish Lipschitz continuity properties of time-stepping operators associated
with classical numerical schemes and identify low-complexity structures
inherent in these operators for several classes of PDEs, including
reaction-diffusion equations, parabolic equations with external forcing, and
scalar conservation laws. Leveraging these structural insights, we obtain
generalization bounds that demonstrate efficient learnability without incurring
the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we extend our analysis from single-input
operator learning to a general multi-input setting, thereby broadening the
applicability of our results.

TL;DR: Novel stabilization strategy for Galerkin formulation of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that enables high accuracy with high-order elements on unstructured meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high accuracy while ensuring convergence and compatibility with high-order elements on unstructured meshes for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Method: Fractional step method with carefully defined boundary conditions to obtain consistent pressure field, integrated with a stabilization strategy that shares the same principle as natural stabilization in fractional step methods.

Result: Numerical dissipation decreases with increasing polynomial order, and test cases confirm convergence under both mesh refinement and increasing polynomial order.

Conclusion: The proposed stabilization method is effective for high-order accurate simulations of incompressible flows on unstructured meshes, demonstrating robust convergence properties.

Abstract: This work presents a novel stabilization strategy for the Galerkin
formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, developed to achieve
high accuracy while ensuring convergence and compatibility with high-order
elements on unstructured meshes. The numerical algorithm employs a fractional
step method with carefully defined boundary conditions to obtain a consistent
pressure field, enabling high-order temporal accuracy. The proposed
stabilization is seamlessly integrated into the algorithm and shares the same
underlying principle as the natural stabilization inherent in the fractional
step method, both rely on the difference between the gradient operator and its
projection. The numerical dissipation associated to the stabilization term is
found to diminish with increasing polynomial order of the elements. Numerical
test cases confirm the effectiveness of the method, demonstrating convergence
under mesh refinement and increasing polynomial order.

*Laura Grigori,Lorenzo Piccinini,Igor Simunec*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Randomized two-sided Gram-Schmidt process for biorthogonalization using sketching matrices, offering computational efficiency, better stability, and lower condition numbers compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and numerically stable alternative to the classical two-sided Gram-Schmidt process for biorthogonalization of matrices, addressing computational cost and stability issues.

Method: Proposes a randomized algorithm that uses sketching matrices satisfying oblivious subspace embedding properties to replace exact biorthogonality conditions with sketch-based conditions, maintaining range preservation while reducing computational complexity.

Result: The randomized approach is computationally less expensive, has better numerical stability, and produces bases with smaller condition numbers compared to deterministic methods. Multiple implementations are analyzed and compared numerically.

Conclusion: The randomized two-sided Gram-Schmidt process provides an effective alternative to classical methods, with demonstrated applications in nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithms for eigenvalue and eigenvector approximation, offering improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a randomized two-sided Gram-Schmidt process for the
biorthogonalization of two given matrices $X, Y \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$. The
algorithm aims to find two matrices $Q, P \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ such that
${\rm range}(X) = {\rm range}(Q)$, ${\rm range}(Y) = {\rm range}(P)$ and
$(\Omega Q)^T \Omega P = I$, where $\Omega \in\mathbb{R}^{s \times n}$ is a
sketching matrix satisfying an oblivious subspace $\varepsilon$-embedding
property; in other words, the biorthogonality condition on the columns of $Q$
and $P$ is replaced by an equivalent condition on their sketches. This
randomized approach is computationally less expensive than the classical
two-sided Gram-Schmidt process, has better numerical stability, and the
condition number of the computed bases $Q, P$ is often smaller than in the
deterministic case. Several different implementations of the randomized
algorithm are analyzed and compared numerically. The randomized two-sided
Gram-Schmidt process is applied to the nonsymmetric Lancozs algorithm for the
approximation of eigenvalues and both left and right eigenvectors.

### [11] [An Arbitrary-Order Moving-Mesh Finite Element Algorithm for One-Dimensional Implicit Moving Boundary Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04409)
*Matthew E Hubbard,Thomas J Radley*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A high-order moving-mesh finite element method for 1D moving boundary problems with implicit boundary velocity dependence, using conservative ALE approach and achieving arbitrary-order accuracy without geometric conservation law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate and efficient method for moving boundary problems where boundary velocity depends on the interior solution, avoiding the need for discrete geometric conservation laws while maintaining high-order accuracy.

Method: Two-stage algorithm: (1) compute velocity field for moving domain boundary and internal mesh using high-order approximation to distributed local conservation principle, (2) approximate PDE solution on updated mesh. Uses conservative arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach with piecewise linear mesh velocity variation.

Result: The method achieves arbitrary-order accuracy in both space and time, is explicit in time, requires only linear system inversions per time-step, and operates fully in physical domain without reference mapping.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective high-order accurate approach for moving boundary problems with implicit boundary velocity dependence, offering computational efficiency through explicit time-stepping and linear system solutions while maintaining accuracy without geometric conservation constraints.

Abstract: We present a one-dimensional high-order moving-mesh finite element method for
moving boundary problems where the boundary velocity depends implicitly on the
solution in the interior of the domain. The method employs a conservative
arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to predict the evolution of the
approximate solution. It retains the order of accuracy of the underlying
fixed-mesh method by (i) computing the boundary velocities using a high-order
approximation to a distributed local conservation principle which generates a
Lagrangian `flow' velocity and (ii) assuming a continuous piecewise linear
variation of the mesh velocity field in the interior of the computational
domain.
  Within each time-step the algorithm consists of two stages: the computation
of a velocity field with which to move both the domain boundary and the
internal mesh, and the approximation of the solution to the PDE on the updated
mesh. Both internal and boundary velocities are generated within the same
framework, though it would be simple to replace the internal mesh velocity
field by applying a more traditional mesh movement strategy (for example, one
which seeks to equidistribute an error indicator at each time-step): the
high-order accuracy should be retained as long the discrete velocity which is
used in the solution update is assumed to vary linearly within mesh elements.
The proposed method is explicit in time, requires only the inversion of linear
systems of equations within each time-step, and is implemented fully in the
physical domain, so no mapping to a reference domain is employed. It attains
arbitrary-order accuracy in both space and time without the need to satisfy a
discrete geometric conservation law.

*Gong Chen,Abdon Moutinho*

TL;DR: Asymptotic stability of multi-solitons for 1D L^2 supercritical NLS on finite-codimension manifold when soliton velocities are sufficiently separated and k > 11/4


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solitary waves are unstable for 1D L^2 supercritical NLS, and previous work established asymptotic stability on codimension-one manifold for single solitons

Method: Using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix charge transfer models from previous work to prove asymptotic stability

Result: Proves asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on finite-codimension manifold for k > 11/4 with sufficiently separated soliton velocities

Conclusion: Extends previous single soliton results to multi-soliton configurations under velocity separation conditions for supercritical NLS

Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional $L^2$ supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation \begin{equation} i\partial_{t}\psi+\partial^{2}_{x}\psi+\vert
\psi\vert^{2k}\psi=0 \text{, $k>2$}. \end{equation} It is well known that
solitary waves for this equation are unstable. In the pioneering work of
Krieger and Schlag \cite{KriegerSchlag}, the asymptotic stability of a solitary
wave was established on a codimension-one center-stable manifold. In the
present paper, using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix
charge transfer models in our previous work, \cite{dispanalysis1}, we prove
asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on a finite-codimension manifold for
$k>\frac{11}{4}$, provided that the soliton velocities are sufficiently
separated.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop specialized function spaces for studying time-periodic phenomena on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds and apply them to understand global hypoellipticity properties of evolution equations.

Method: Define time-periodic Gevrey-Sobolev-Kato spaces and characterize them through Fourier expansions associated with suitable elliptic operators on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds.

Result: Established characterization of these function spaces via Fourier expansions and applied this framework to study global hypoellipticity for a class of time-periodic evolution equations.

Conclusion: The introduced function spaces provide a useful framework for analyzing time-periodic evolution equations on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, particularly for studying global hypoellipticity properties.

Abstract: We introduce time-periodic Gevrey-Sobolev-Kato spaces on asymptotically
Euclidean manifolds and study their characterisation throughout Fourier
expansions associated with suitable elliptic operators. As an application, we
study the global hypoellipticity problem for a naturally associated class of
time-periodic evolution equations.

### [14] [Inverse problem for semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operators in arbitrary dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03760)
*Rodrigo Lecaros,Ariel A. Pérez,Manuel F. Prado*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of inverse problems for semidiscrete stochastic parabolic equations using Carleman estimates to establish stability for source identification and Cauchy problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve two types of inverse problems in semidiscrete stochastic parabolic equations: identifying random source terms from terminal observations and reconstructing solutions from boundary data.

Method: Established two Carleman estimates for semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operators (homogeneous and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions) and applied them to prove stability results.

Result: Obtained Lipschitz stability for the inverse source problem and Hölder stability for the Cauchy inverse problem.

Conclusion: The developed Carleman estimates provide effective tools for establishing stability in semidiscrete stochastic parabolic inverse problems, enabling reliable solution reconstruction from limited observational data.

Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of inverse problems for space semidiscrete
stochastic parabolic equations in arbitrary dimensions. The first problem
concerns a semidiscrete inverse source problem, which involves determining the
random source term of the white noise in the stochastic parabolic equation
using observation data of the solution at the terminal time and the trace of
the discrete spatial derivative of the solution on a subdomain at the boundary
of the space. The second problem addresses a semidiscrete Cauchy inverse
problem, which involves determining the solution of the stochastic parabolic
equation in a subdomain of space-time, from the data of the solution and the
trace of the discrete spatial derivative on a subdomain of the boundary of
space and time. To address these problems, we establish two Carleman estimates
for a semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operator in arbitrary dimensions: one
for the homogeneous boundary condition and the other for the nonhomogeneous
boundary condition. Applying these Carleman estimates, we obtain Lipschitz and
H\"older stability for the first and second inverse problems, respectively.

*Kuang Huang,Zhiyuan Li,Zhidong Zhang,Zhi Zhou*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Recovery of spatially dependent source in 1D space-time fractional wave equation using single-endpoint boundary measurements, with uniqueness and stability results using bi-orthogonal basis for Mittag-Leffler functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inverse source problem in fractional wave equations where traditional orthogonal eigenfunction systems fail due to spatial fractional derivatives, requiring new mathematical approaches for boundary measurement data.

Method: Introduce bi-orthogonal basis for Mittag-Leffler functions to handle non-orthogonal eigenfunctions, establish uniqueness and Hölder-type stability with sufficient measurement time, and implement Tikhonov regularization for numerical solution.

Result: Successfully established theoretical uniqueness and stability results, and demonstrated accurate and efficient numerical recovery of spatially dependent sources through multiple numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed bi-orthogonal basis approach effectively addresses the non-orthogonality challenge in fractional wave equations, enabling successful inverse source recovery with boundary measurements and providing both theoretical guarantees and practical numerical solutions.

Abstract: We study the recovery of a spatially dependent source in a one-dimensional
space-time fractional wave equation using boundary measurement data collected
at a single endpoint. The main challenge arises from the fact that the
eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem do not form an orthogonal
system, due to the presence of a fractional derivative in space. To address
this difficulty, we introduce a bi-orthogonal basis for the Mittag-Leffler
functions and use it to establish uniqueness and H\"older-type stability
results, provided the measurement time is sufficiently large. A Tikhonov
regularization method is then employed to numerically solve the inverse source
problem. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy
and efficiency of the proposed method and to validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: Analysis of energy decay and blow-up behavior in viscoelastic wave equations with polynomial nonlinearity and weak damping, establishing decay results and blow-up time bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term behavior of solutions to viscoelastic wave equations with polynomial nonlinearity and weak damping, specifically examining energy decay patterns and conditions leading to finite-time blow-up.

Method: Established explicit decay results by imposing polynomial conditions on the relaxation function with small initial energy. Used Levine's convexity method to derive upper bound for blow-up time when initial energy is below potential well depth, and provided lower bound for blow-up time.

Result: Obtained general decay results for solutions under polynomial relaxation function conditions with sufficiently small initial energy. Derived both upper and lower bounds for the blow-up time when solutions exhibit finite-time blow-up behavior.

Conclusion: The study successfully characterizes both energy decay patterns and blow-up behavior in viscoelastic wave equations, providing quantitative bounds for blow-up times and establishing conditions for solution stability through energy decay analysis.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the energy decay and the finite time blow-up of
the solution to a viscoelastic wave equation with polynomial nonlinearity and
weak damping. We establish explicit and general decay results for the solutions
by imposing polynomial conditions on the relaxation function, provided that the
initial energy is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for
the blow-up time when the initial energy is less than the depth of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the scattering properties and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell system, particularly whether small data solutions demonstrate linear scattering.

Method: The proof utilizes the Lorentz invariance property of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations to analyze the asymptotic completeness and scattering behavior.

Result: The study demonstrates that small data solutions do not verify linear scattering under generic asymptotic conditions on the charge, establishing non-L^1 asymptotic completeness.

Conclusion: The Vlasov-Maxwell system exhibits non-linear scattering behavior for small data solutions, with the Lorentz invariance playing a crucial role in this non-scattering property.

Abstract: We prove that under a generic asymptotic condition on the charge, the small
data solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell system do not verify linear scattering. In
other words, we show the non-$L^1$ asymptotic completeness of the system. The
proof makes use of the Lorentz invariance of the equations.

TL;DR: Existence and behavior of entire positive radial solutions for semilinear elliptic systems with Keller-Osserman-type conditions and integrable weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend classical Keller-Osserman theory to coupled elliptic systems with general nonlinearities and weight functions, addressing existence and qualitative properties of solutions.

Method: Develop a novel subharmonic functional tailored to reciprocal integral conditions, analyze the system under finite Keller-Osserman-type integral conditions on nonlinearities and integrability constraints on radial weights.

Result: Established: (i) existence of infinitely many entire positive radial solutions, (ii) closedness of admissible central values set, (iii) blow-up behavior at infinity for boundary solutions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends classical theory to coupled systems, providing comprehensive existence and qualitative results for a broad class of elliptic systems with general nonlinearities and weights.

Abstract: We investigate the existence and qualitative behavior of entire positive
radial solutions to the semilinear elliptic system% \begin{equation*} \Delta
u=p(|x|)\,g(v),\qquad \Delta v=q(|x|)\,f(u),\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}% ^{n},\
n\geq 3, \end{equation*}% under finite Keller--Osserman-type integral
conditions on the nonlinearities $f$ and $g$, and integrability constraints on
the radial weights $p$ and $q$% . The nonlinearities are assumed continuous on
$[0,\infty )$, differentiable on $(0,\infty )$, vanish at the origin, and are
strictly positive elsewhere, with% \begin{equation*} \int_{1}^{\infty
}\frac{dt}{g(f(t))}<\infty ,\qquad \int_{1}^{\infty }\frac{%
dt}{f(g(t))}<\infty . \end{equation*}% The weights satisfy $\int_{0}^{\infty
}s\,p(s)\,ds<\infty $, $% \int_{0}^{\infty }s\,q(s)\,ds<\infty $, and $\min
(p,q)$ is not compactly supported. Within this framework, we establish: (i) the
existence of infinitely many entire positive radial solutions for a nonempty
set of central values; (ii) closedness of the set of admissible central values;
and (iii) largeness (blow-up at infinity) of solutions corresponding to
boundary points of this set. The approach is based on a novel subharmonic
functional tailored to the reciprocal integral conditions, extending classical
Keller--Osserman theory to a broad class of coupled systems with general
nonlinearities and weight functions.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of dilute particle system coupled with non-Newtonian fluid flow via drag force in bounded domain, showing large data existence of weak solutions for thin spray regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study coupled PDE systems describing particle-fluid interactions with non-Newtonian fluids, particularly relevant for materials with instantaneous property changes (e.g., electric field-switched materials).

Method: Mathematical analysis of coupled PDE system with drag force connection, assuming monotone Cauchy stress tensor with asymptotically (s-1)-growth, log-Hölder continuous spatial dependence, and no time smoothness requirements.

Result: Proved long-time and large data existence of weak solutions for the parameter range s ≥ (3d+2)/(d+2), where d is spatial dimension.

Conclusion: Established existence theory for coupled particle-non-Newtonian fluid systems under minimal regularity assumptions, applicable to materials with instantaneous property variations.

Abstract: We analyze the system of equations describing the flow of a dilute particle
system coupled with an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid in a bounded domain.
In this setting, both PDEs are connected via a drag force, or the friction
force. We are interested in a thin spray regime, which means that we neglect
the inter-particle interactions. When it comes to the fluid system, the Cauchy
stress tensor is supposed to be a monotone mapping and has asymptotically
$(s-1)$-growth with the parameter $s$ depending on the spatial and time
variable. We do not assume any smoothness of $s$ with respect to time variable
and assume the log-H\"{o}lder continuity with respect to spatial variable. An
example of materials, which satisfy those assumptions, are those whose
properties are instantaneous, e.g. changed by the switched electric field. We
show the long time and the large data existence of weak solution provided that
$s\ge\frac{3d+2}{d+2}$.

TL;DR: Semi-global existence result for Einstein-Dirac system using characteristic initial value formulation without symmetry assumptions, with novel approach to handle curvature coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein-Dirac system governing gravity-spin-1/2 field interactions, extending previous work to handle this coupled system without imposing symmetry conditions.

Method: Applied Luk's strategy using double null foliation, promoted symmetric spinorial derivatives to independent variables, derived a 'Weyl-curvature-free' evolution system, and used spinor-specific techniques to handle Dirac field structure.

Result: Successfully constructed smooth solutions in a rectangular region to the future of two intersecting null hypersurfaces with specified characteristic initial data.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates curvature coupling in energy estimates and closes bootstrap at optimal derivative levels, providing a robust framework for analyzing the Einstein-Dirac system.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the characteristic initial value problem for
the Einstein-Dirac system, a model governing the interaction between gravity
and spin-$1/2$ fields. We apply Luk's strategy \cite{Luk12} and prove a
semi-global existence result for this coupled Einstein-Dirac system without
imposing symmetry conditions. More precisely, we construct smooth solutions in
a rectangular region to the future of two intersecting null hypersurfaces, on
which characteristic initial data are specified. The key novelty is to promote
the symmetric spinorial derivatives of the Dirac field to independent variables
and to derive a commuted "Weyl-curvature-free" evolution system for them. This
eliminates the coupling to the curvature in the energy estimates and closes the
bootstrap at the optimal derivative levels. The analysis relies on a double
null foliation and incorporates spinor-specific techniques essential to
handling the structure of the Dirac field.

results of Kenig, Preiss & Toro, Toro & Zhao and Azzam & Mourgoglou, including
a partial answer to Bishop's question regarding the validity of Oksendal's

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for uniquely reconstructing potentials in inverse Sturm-Liouville problems using partial spectral data, with applications to wave imaging and Schrödinger equation inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve inverse coefficient determination problems for evolutionary PDEs, including passive wave-based imaging and active imaging for time-dependent Schrödinger equations with unknown sources, without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data.

Method: Uses Kahane's interpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling recovery from partial spectral data (fraction of Dirichlet eigenvalues and normal derivatives of eigenfunctions at endpoints).

Result: Demonstrates unique reconstruction of potentials and provides optimal time measurement bounds for inverse coefficient determination problems.

Conclusion: The approach offers a novel framework for solving inverse problems with partial spectral data, eliminating previous requirements for analyticity or infinite-time measurements, with potential applications in imaging and quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval from
partial knowledge of spectral data. Specifically, we show that the potential
can be uniquely reconstructed from the knowledge of a fraction of Dirichlet
eigenvalues together with the normal derivatives of the corresponding
eigenfunctions at both endpoints. We present two novel applications of our
spectral result in inverse coefficient determination problems for evolutionary
PDEs that include passive wave-based imaging of a medium and active imaging for
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with unknown internal sources. Our
results yield optimal time measurement bounds for such inverse coefficient
determination problems. A central innovation is the use of Kahane's
interpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling
the recovery without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data,
as in previous approaches. Finally, in the appendix, we present a spectral
interpolation theorem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators, which may be
of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the analysis of focusing fourth-order Schrodinger equation systems with radial initial data and general power-type nonlinearities in the energy-critical setting.

Method: Establish hypotheses on nonlinearities and prove their implications; use virial argument for blow-up results; employ concentration-compactness/rigidity method for scattering.

Result: Local well-posedness in H^2 space, existence of ground state solutions, blow-up for negative energy or high kinetic energy data, scattering for solutions below ground state energy levels.

Conclusion: Comprehensive framework for analyzing fourth-order Schrodinger systems with complete characterization of solution behavior including existence, blow-up, and scattering properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of focusing fourth-order Schr\"odinger
equations in the energy-critical setting with radial initial data and general
power-type nonlinearities. The main idea is to generalize the analysis of such
systems: we first establish several hypotheses on the nonlinearities and prove
their implications. These implications are then used to establish a local
well-posedness result in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and and to prove the existence of
ground state solutions. Using a virial argument, we demonstrate a blow-up
result for initial data with negative energy or with kinetic energy exceeding
that of the ground state. Finally, employing the
concentration-compactness/rigidity method, we prove a scattering result for
solutions whose energy and kinetic energy are below those of the ground state.

Motivation: Neural networks show promise as PDE solvers but face challenges with high accuracy and scalability across different problem scales and boundary conditions.

Result: Successfully trained a single network to simulate large-scale 2D Maxwell's equations with varying sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and dielectric media, and demonstrated accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices.

Conclusion: This approach provides a promising path for building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability bottlenecks in conventional divide-and-conquer TDMA algorithms caused by their sequential structure, particularly for multi-GPU systems where inter-GPU communication and low-occupancy computation limit performance.

Method: Developed a pipelined TDMA that overlaps communication with computation and executes GPU kernels concurrently. Optimized batch size to balance GPU occupancy and pipeline efficiency. Integrated into ADI-based fractional-step method for Poisson solver in flow simulations.

Result: Achieved ideal weak scaling up to 64 GPUs with 1B grid cells per GPU, 74.7% of ideal performance in strong scaling for 4B-cell problem. Accelerated TDMA component by 4.37x in 9B-cell simulation on 64 GPUs, contributing to 1.31x overall speedup of complete flow solver.

Conclusion: Pipelined-TDMA successfully hides non-scalable execution time (communication and low-occupancy computation) and resolves scalability bottlenecks, making it effective for large-scale multi-GPU systems in computational fluid dynamics applications.

Abstract: A tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA), Pipelined-TDMA, is developed for
multi-GPU systems to resolve the scalability bottlenecks caused by the
sequential structure of conventional divide-and-conquer TDMA. The proposed
method pipelines multiple tridiagonal systems, overlapping communication with
computation and executing GPU kernels concurrently to hide non-scalable stages
behind scalable compute stages. To maximize performance, the batch size is
optimized to strike a balance between GPU occupancy and pipeline efficiency:
larger batches improve throughput for solving tridiagonal systems, while
excessively large batches reduce pipeline utilization. Performance evaluations
on up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using a one-dimensional (1D) slab-type domain
decomposition confirm that, except for the terminal phase of the pipeline, the
proposed method successfully hides most of the non-scalable execution
time-specifically inter-GPU communication and low-occupancy computation. The
solver achieves ideal weak scaling up to 64 GPUs with one billion grid cells
per GPU and reaches 74.7 percent of ideal performance in strong scaling tests
for a 4-billion-cell problem, relative to a 4-GPU baseline. The optimized TDMA
is integrated into an ADI-based fractional-step method to remove the
scalability bottleneck in the Poisson solver of the flow solver (Ha et al.,
2021). In a 9-billion-cell simulation on 64 GPUs, the TDMA component in the
Poisson solver is accelerated by 4.37x, contributing to a 1.31x overall speedup
of the complete flow solver.

challenges, and recent years have seen a growing integration with machine
learning techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how they
are reshaping the field, with a particular focus on the data-driven
construction of collective variables. Furthermore, these techniques have also
improved biasing schemes and unlocked novel strategies via reinforcement

highlight applications spanning different areas such as biomolecular processes,
ligand binding, catalytic reactions, and phase transitions. We conclude by
outlining future directions aimed at enabling more automated strategies for

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model that strictly satisfies both energy conservation and entropy increase principles, addressing thermodynamic consistency in plasma modeling.

Method: Constructed a model using Helmholtz free energy framework with convex-concave characteristics (convex in plasma number density, concave in temperature) to derive thermodynamic quantities. Developed a temporally discrete numerical scheme with proven thermodynamic consistency.

Result: The proposed method satisfies both first law (global energy conservation) and second law (non-decreasing total entropy) of thermodynamics. Numerical experiments validate effectiveness in capturing key plasma phenomena.

Conclusion: The thermodynamically consistent two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic model successfully maintains energy conservation and entropy principles while providing accurate plasma simulations, with rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical validation.

Abstract: In this paper, we proposes a thermodynamically consistent two-fluid
magnetohydrodynamic model based on the Helmholtz free energy framework, which
strictly satisfies both the principles of energy conservation and entropy
increase in the two-fluid model. By constructing the convexe-concave
characteristics of the free energy density (convexity with respect to plasma
number density and concavity with respect to temperature), the model
self-consistently derives key thermodynamic quantities such as chemical
potential, entropy density, and internal energy. Based on the proposed modeling
framework and the convex-concave properties of the Helmholtz free energy
density, we develop a temporally discrete numerical scheme with thermodynamic
consistency. We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first
law of thermodynamics (global energy conservation) and the second law
(non-decreasing total entropy). Additionally, we provide spatiotemporal error
estimates for the 2D degenerate system used in practical computations.
Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
capturing key plasma phenomena.

TL;DR: Nonperturbative guiding-center model provides exact alternative to full-orbit simulations, showing magnetic moment contains parametric resonances that destroy long-term conservation, refuting previous claims about all-time invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional guiding-center theory and provide an exact alternative for charged particle dynamics simulations, particularly in cases where perturbative approaches may fail.

Method: Using the nonperturbative guiding-center model to analyze charged particle motion in homogeneous, time-varying magnetic fields, demonstrating solvability and constructing exact magnetic moments asymptotic to adiabatic invariant series.

Result: The exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances that destroy conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times, contrasting with perturbative invariants.

Conclusion: The findings refute previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment and demonstrate the superiority of the nonperturbative approach for capturing long-term dynamics and resonance effects.

Abstract: The nonperturbative guiding-center model provides an exact alternative to
full-orbit simulations of charged particle dynamics in situations where
traditional guiding-center theory may fail. We demonstrate that the charged
particle motion in a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field is a solvable
example of the nonperturbative guiding-center model. This entails showing that
the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be
asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the
perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about
parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual
magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about
the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.

TL;DR: Reproduction of DC magnetron sputtering voltage-pressure dependence using 2D-RZ PIC simulation and 1D-axial fluid model, providing theoretical explanation for why voltage decreases with increasing pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The voltage-pressure (V-P) dependence in DC magnetron sputtering is fundamental to device performance but has not been satisfactorily explained or reproduced with simulation previously.

Method: Used 2D-RZ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to reproduce experimental V-P dependence, then developed a steady-state 1D-axial fluid model of sheath and presheath informed by PIC results.

Result: Successfully reproduced V-P dependence curves matching past experiments. Found voltage decrease with pressure is due to compensation for increased neutral density by lowering plasma electron energy (reducing ionization probability), not electron recapture at cathode.

Conclusion: The study provides both simulation and theoretical explanation for V-P dependence, revealing that constant current dictates constant global ionization rate, and electron reflection at cathode only affects sheath voltage/width, not presheath or bulk plasma.

Abstract: We reproduce the consistently-seen experimental voltage versus pressure (V-P)
dependence of DC magnetron sputtering (DCMS) with 2D-RZ particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulation. Informed by PIC simulation, we develop a steady-state, 1D-axial
fluid model of the sheath and presheath that also reproduces this V-P
dependence. The V-P dependence is the relationship between the steady-state
voltage needed to maintain a constant discharge current and the neutral gas
pressure. V-P dependence is fundamental to device performance, but has not
previously been reproduced with simulation or satisfactorily explained. In this
work, we compare the V-P curve of our simulated device and fluid model with
past experiments and then present a theoretical explanation for this V-P
dependence. We find that the decrease in voltage with increasing pressure is
not due to electron recapture at the cathode. Rather, the constant current
dictates a constant global ionization rate, so the voltage decrease compensates
for the increase in neutral gas density by lowering the energy of the plasma
electrons, which decreases their ionization probability. The PIC simulations
also reveal that the presheath and bulk plasma are unaffected by the electron
reflection coefficient at the cathode; the only effect of increasing reflection
is a reduction in the sheath voltage and width. In addition to the potential
structure, we explore how pressure affects the plasma density, particle drifts,
and particle energy distributions.

Abstract: Commemorating the 2024 S. Chandrasekhar Prize, this review provides a
retrospective on the genesis and evolution of plasma wakefield acceleration. It
traces the journey from prehistory and the invention of the Plasma Wakefield

profound reverberations across fundamental physics, including astrophysics and
analog gravity. The narrative emphasizes conceptual evolution, key theoretical
breakthroughs, and future outlook, culminating in a vision for hybrid schemes
and next-generation colliders. In addition to application to particle
accelerators and high energy collider physics, it is found that plasma
wakefield, with its ultra-intense acceleration, can also be applied to
investigate gravity effects in the laboratory based on Einstein's equivalence
principle. A specific example is accelerating flying relativistic plasma
mirrors to investigate the celebrated black hole Hawking evaporation and the
associated information loss paradox. We describe an ongoing experiment, AnaBHEL
(Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers), which aims at shedding some lights
on the black hole information loss paradox.

Motivation: To create a specialized scaling law from the 2023 negative triangularity campaign data on DIII-D, addressing the challenges of small single-machine dataset size and minimizing sampling bias.

Method: Regression procedure using data from DIII-D campaign with measures to minimize sampling bias and provide realistic uncertainty estimates from the regression analysis.

Result: The new power law scaling shows energy confinement properties similar to or exceeding IPB98(y,2) scaling, with robustly stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation compared to H-mode scaling law.

Conclusion: The negative triangularity campaign demonstrates promising energy confinement performance, and the developed scaling law provides valuable insights despite dataset limitations, showing distinct characteristics from traditional H-mode scaling.

Abstract: Results from the 2023 negative triangularity campaign on DIII-D demonstrate
encouraging energy confinement properties, similar to or exceeding the scaling
of the IPB98(y,2) law. This paper describes the procedure with which a new

Given the relatively small size of the single-machine dataset, measures were
taken to minimize sampling bias and give a realistic estimate of the large
uncertainties from the regression. The resulting power law shows a robustly
stronger dependence on plasma current and more severe power degradation as
compared to the H-mode scaling law.

TL;DR: TRANSP simulations compare MMM and TGLF transport models on NSTX data. MMM shows better agreement with experimental temperature profiles despite lower computational cost than TGLF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well modern reduced transport models can reproduce experimentally observed temperature profiles in spherical tokamaks using NSTX discharge data.

Method: Time-dependent predictive simulations using 1.5D tokamak integrated modeling code TRANSP on high-performing NSTX discharges, comparing Multi-Mode Model (MMM) and Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid (TGLF) models.

Result: MMM consistently outperforms TGLF with median overpredictions of 28% for Te and 27% for Ti, while TGLF overpredicts Te by 46% and underpredicts Ti by 25%. Electromagnetic turbulence is crucial in high beta regimes.

Conclusion: MMM's reasonable agreement with experiment motivates further examination for self-consistent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios, highlighting the importance of transport model selection and electromagnetic effects.

Abstract: Time-dependent, predictive simulations were performed with the 1.5D tokamak
integrated modeling code TRANSP on a large set of well-analyzed, high
performing discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) in
order to evaluate how well modern reduced transport models can reproduce
experimentally observed temperature profiles in spherical tokamaks. Overall, it
is found that simulations using the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) more consistently
agree with the NSTX observations than those using the Trapped Gyro-Landau Fluid
(TGLF) model, despite TGLF requiring orders of magnitude greater computational
cost. When considering all examined discharges, MMM has median overpredictions
of electron temperature ($T_e$) and ion temperature ($T_i$) profiles of 28% and
27%, respectively, relative to the experiment. TGLF overpredicts $T_e$ by 46%,
with much larger variance than MMM, and underpredicts $T_i$ by 25%. As $\beta$
is increased across NSTX discharges, TGLF predicts lower $T_e$ and significant
flattening of the $T_i$ profile, conflicting with NSTX observations. When using
an electrostatic version of TGLF, both $T_e$ and $T_i$ are substantially
overpredicted, underscoring the importance of electromagnetic turbulence in the
high $\beta$ spherical tokamak regime. Additionally, calculations with neural
net surrogate models for TGLF were performed outside of TRANSP with a time
slice flux matching transport solver, finding better agreement with experiment
than the TRANSP simulations, highlighting the impact of different transport
solvers and simulation techniques. Altogether, the reasonable agreement with
experiment of temperature profiles predicted by MMM motivates a more detailed
examination of the sensitivities of the TRANSP simulations with MMM to
different NSTX plasma regimes in a companion paper, in preparation for
self-consistent, time-dependent predictive modeling of NSTX-U scenarios.

TL;DR: The Multi-Mode Model (MMM) was applied to NSTX discharges, showing reasonable agreement with temperature profiles but generally overpredicting confinement and producing overly steep profiles compared to experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate MMM's sensitivities across various plasma conditions and understand its regime-dependent performance characteristics for turbulent transport predictions in NSTX experiments.

Method: Time-dependent predictive simulations using the 1.5D tokamak integrated modeling code TRANSP, applied to hundreds of milliseconds of NSTX discharge data across a wide range of plasma conditions.

Result: MMM predicted reasonable T_e and T_i temperature profiles, outperforming TGLF model. Electron energy transport dominated by ETG modes at low β/high collisionality, transitioning to mixed modes at higher β/lower collisionality. MMM typically overpredicted confinement, producing overly steep profiles, with better agreement for broader T_e profiles, higher β, and longer confinement times.

Conclusion: MMM shows regime-dependent performance with robust convergence properties, providing useful context for future predictive simulations of NSTX-U discharges, though it tends to overpredict confinement relative to experimental observations.

Abstract: The Multi-Mode Model (MMM) for turbulent transport was applied to a large set
of well-analyzed discharges from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX)
in order to evaluate its sensitivities to a wide range of plasma conditions.
MMM calculations were performed for hundreds of milliseconds in each discharge
by performing time-dependent predictive simulations with the 1.5D tokamak
integrated modeling code TRANSP. A closely related study concluded that MMM
predicted electron ($T_e$) and ion ($T_i$) temperature profiles that were in
reasonable agreement with NSTX observations, generally outperforming a
different reduced transport model, TGLF, motivating a more thorough
investigation of the characteristics of the MMM predictions. The simulations
with MMM have electron energy transport dominated by electron temperature
gradient modes for relatively low plasma $\beta$ and high collisionality,
transitioning to a mixture of different modes for higher $\beta$ and lower
collisionality. The thermal ion diffusivity predicted by MMM is much smaller
than the neoclassical contribution, in line with previous experimental analysis
of NSTX. Nonetheless, the $T_e$ and $T_i$ profiles are coupled via collisional
energy exchange and thus sensitive to which transport channels are predicted.
The simulations with MMM are robust to the simulation start time, converging to
remarkably similar temperatures later during the discharge. MMM typically
overpredicts confinement relative to NSTX observations, leading to the
prediction of overly steep profiles. Plasmas with spatially broader $T_e$
profiles, higher $\beta$, and longer energy confinement times tend to be
predicted by MMM with better agreement with the experiment. These findings
provide useful context for understanding the regime-dependent tendencies of MMM
in anticipation of self-consistent, time-dependent predictive simulations of
NSTX-U discharges.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence using PIC simulations, finding that effective viscosity scales similarly to collisional plasma and enables accurate MHD/two-fluid modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional form of dissipation in nearly collisionless plasma, where traditional viscosity and resistivity definitions don't apply, and to determine if viscous-like energy conversion exists with scaling analogous to collisional plasma.

Method: Used 2.5D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless plasma turbulence with a scale-filtering approach to estimate effective viscosity at each scale, then compared with MHD and two-fluid simulations using the same viscosity values.

Result: Found striking similarity in global behavior between PIC simulations and MHD/two-fluid simulations when using the effective viscosity estimate, suggesting analogous dissipation scaling to collisional plasma.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that effective viscosity can be estimated for collisionless plasma and used successfully in fluid models, with implications for understanding dissipation mechanisms in space plasmas.

Abstract: While dissipation in collisional plasma is defined in terms of viscosity and
resistivity, the exact functional form of dissipation i.e., the so-called
dissipation function in nearly collisionless plasma is unknown. Nevertheless,
previous studies have suggested that there exists viscous-like energy
conversion in collisionless plasma with scaling characteristics analogous to
collisional plasma, and in particular that the average dissipation is
proportional to the square of the rate of strain as in hydrodynamics. In this
study, using 2.5D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of collisionless
plasma turbulence, we provide an estimate of effective viscosity at each scale,
obtained via a scale-filtering approach. We then compare the turbulent dynamics
of the PIC simulation with that from MHD and two-fluid simulations in which
with the viscosity is equal to the effective viscosity estimate obtained from
the PIC simulation. We find that the global behavior in these MHD and two-fluid
simulations has a striking similarity with that in its kinetic/PIC counterpart.
In addition, we explore the scale dependence of the effective viscosity, and
discuss implications of this approach for space plasmas.

capacitance operator is provided to characterize the nonlinear subwavelength

TL;DR: New machine-learning approach for Coulomb explosion imaging enables automated analysis of high-dimensional molecular dynamics data, allowing robust identification of molecular structures and differentiation of isomers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coulomb explosion imaging generates rich high-dimensional data with embedded correlations, but current methods struggle to visualize and exploit these correlations in multi-dimensional parameter space, limiting the extraction of structural information.

Method: Developed a new CEI approach for intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to eight ionic fragments in coincidence and using machine-learning-based analysis to identify patterns and correlations in high-dimensional momentum-space data.

Result: The method provides high-dimensional background-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and successfully distinguishes dichloroethylene isomers, demonstrating automated molecular structure identification.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a scalable framework for extracting insightful information from CEI data and paves the way for channel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and detecting weak channels.

Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful technique for capturing the
real-time motion of individual atoms during ultrafast photochemical reactions.
CEI generates high-dimensional data with naturally embedded correlations that
allow mapping the coordinated motion of nuclei in molecules. This enables
reliable separation of competing reaction pathways and makes this approach
uniquely suited for characterizing weak reaction channels. However, rich
information contained in experimental CEI patterns remains largely
underexploited due to challenges in visualizing correlations between multiple
observables in multi-dimensional parameter space. Here we present a new
approach to CEI of intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to
eight ionic fragments in coincidence and leveraging machine-learning-based
analysis to identify patterns and correlations in the resulting
high-dimensional momentum-space data, enabling robust molecular structure
identification and differentiation. Our approach provides high-dimensional
background-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and
establishes an automated, scalable framework for extracting insightful
information from the data. As a demonstration, we apply this method to image
and distinguish dichloroethylene isomers, showcasing its potential for broader
applications in molecular imaging. Our results pave the way for
channel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics in chemically
relevant systems, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and
detecting contributions from weak channels and minority species.

*Ma. Cristina R. Bargo*

Main category: q-bio.PE

TL;DR: Study analyzes sensitivity of COVID-19 infection and death counts to vaccine and disease parameters using ODE modeling, finding vaccine rollout rate more crucial than efficacy for long-term disease control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vaccine hesitancy and determine which parameters most influence COVID-19 outcomes (infections and deaths) to inform public health strategies.

Method: Ordinary differential equation model with Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient to analyze sensitivity to transmission rate, latency period, infectious period, death ratio, vaccine efficacy, and rollout rate.

Result: Death count highly sensitive to death ratio; infection count sensitive to latency period initially but shifts to vaccine rollout rate long-term; vaccine rollout rate more significant than efficacy for controlling disease spread.

Conclusion: Vaccine rollout speed is more important than vaccine efficacy for controlling disease spread, and reducing death ratio through medical advancements is crucial for saving lives.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the
implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many
hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By
looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that
incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the
sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the
cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease
transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period
($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio
($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$).
This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank
correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$
and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other
hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation,
but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$
initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the
importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in
curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to
reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the
healthcare system as a whole.

TL;DR: Analog electronic implementation of oscillatory neural networks (HORN) successfully replicates digital dynamics but requires retrained readout layer for equivalent classification performance due to precision differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of implementing oscillatory recurrent networks (HORN) in analog-electronic hardware while maintaining computational performance, as existing implementations focus on attractor dynamics rather than transient dynamics.

Method: Used digital twin approach - trained a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification, then transferred parameters to analog electronic implementation. Employed custom error metrics and re-trained linear readout for analog system.

Result: Analog system successfully replicated digital dynamics in most cases, but only 28.39% agreement with digital predictions using original readout. With re-trained readout, classification performance recovered to digital twin level, indicating preserved information content.

Conclusion: Analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation, demonstrating energy-efficient analog systems that exploit brain-inspired transient dynamics.

Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent
Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed,
and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet,
while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor
dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in
analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far
are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in
analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of
the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node
HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained
parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error
metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the
dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall
well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on
the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement
with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch
is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the
floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform
classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a
re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to
that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the
analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic
circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation,
providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit
brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.

Result: Successfully generalized previous results for purely magnetic cases to include electric fields, with the approach covering Coulomb-type potentials of specific form in the massless case.

Conclusion: The method provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing point spectrum absence in electromagnetic Dirac operators, bridging the gap between magnetic-only and full electromagnetic field scenarios.

TL;DR: Framework for reconstructing quadrature domains from quadrature functions using Faber transform, with classification of one-point domains and extension to weighted quadrature domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a systematic approach for reconstructing quadrature domains from their quadrature functions and extend the theory to weighted cases with power and logarithmic weights.

Method: Uses Faber transform to derive formulae relating quadrature functions to Riemann maps, applies this to classify one-point quadrature domains, and extends to weighted cases with power and log weights.

Result: Obtained complete classification of one-point quadrature domains with complex charge, developed reconstruction formulae for power-weighted and log-weighted quadrature domains, and provided illustrative examples.

Conclusion: The Faber transform provides an effective framework for reconstructing quadrature domains from quadrature functions, with successful extension to weighted cases and practical applications demonstrated through examples.

Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected bounded or
unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using
the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann
map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of
one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a
theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form
$\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a > 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and
the limiting case of $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). We obtain Faber
transform formulae for reconstructing these from their respective quadrature
functions as well. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this
approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational
symmetry.

*Hadiya Abdul Hameed,Jaroslaw Paturej,Aykut Erbas*

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: Semiflexible polymers adsorbed on spherical shells can induce shape distortions and nematic ordering, with strong localization causing shrinkage and weak localization leading to elliptic shapes through surface ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how high density of surface-adsorbed semiflexible polymers affects morphology of spherical biological shells like cell nuclei and membranes, which often deviate from perfect spheres.

Method: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of pressurized bead-spring shells with varying attraction strength, chain concentration, and polymerization degree of adsorbed semiflexible polymers.

Result: Strong surface localization causes severe shape distortions and shrinkage. Weak localization leads to nematically ordered phases that create elliptic shell shapes, especially when chain length is comparable to or longer than shell radius.

Conclusion: Provides strategy to control synthetic shell shapes by manipulating polymer localization and length, and suggests mechanism for non-spherical shapes in biological systems.

Abstract: The shape of biological shells, such as cell nuclei, membranes, and vesicles,
often deviates from a perfect sphere due to an interplay of complex
interactions with a myriad of molecular structures. In particular, semiflexible
biopolymers adsorbed to the surfaces of such shells seem to affect their
morphological properties. While the effect of a single, long, semiflexible
chain is relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which a high density
of such surface-adsorbed polymers can alter the morphology of a spherical, soft
confinement, akin to biological shells, remain relatively poorly understood.
Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how
surface adsorption of many semiflexible polymers affects the morphology of a
pressurized bead-spring shell, which is spherical in the absence of these
chains. By varying the attraction strength between the chains and the shell
surface, chain concentration, and the polymerization degree of chains, we
demonstrate that strong surface localization of the chains can induce severe
shape distortions and shrinkage, depending on the chain length and
concentration. Conversely, weak localization does not induce significant shape
fluctuations, yet nematically ordered phases appear on the surface. Notably,
these ordered phases lead to elliptic shell shapes for chains with sizes
comparable to or longer than the radius of the confinement when the elastic
shell is composed of extensible, harmonic bonds. Overall, our findings offer a
strategy to control the shape of synthetic shells by manipulating peripheral
localization and length of semiflexible polymers while suggesting a mechanism
for non-spherical shapes appearing in some biological systems.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges critical gap in probabilistic parallel-in-time methods, providing uncertainty quantification while maintaining compatibility with existing numerical solvers and frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce Prob-GParareal, a probabilistic extension of the GParareal
algorithm designed to provide uncertainty quantification for the
Parallel-in-Time (PinT) solution of (ordinary and partial) differential
equations (ODEs, PDEs). The method employs Gaussian processes (GPs) to model
the Parareal correction function, as GParareal does, further enabling the
propagation of numerical uncertainty across time and yielding probabilistic
forecasts of system's evolution. Furthermore, Prob-GParareal accommodates
probabilistic initial conditions and maintains compatibility with classical
numerical solvers, ensuring its straightforward integration into existing
Parareal frameworks. Here, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of the
computational complexity and derive error bounds of Prob-GParareal. Then, we
numerically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm
on five benchmark ODE systems, including chaotic, stiff, and bifurcation
problems. To showcase the flexibility and potential scalability of the proposed
algorithm, we also consider Prob-nnGParareal, a variant obtained by replacing
the GPs in Parareal with the nearest-neighbors GPs, illustrating its increased
performance on an additional PDE example. This work bridges a critical gap in

TL;DR: New committor estimation method that works at any lag time, reducing bias and sensitivity compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing committor estimation methods are biased when using practical lag times, only working optimally at single time steps.

Method: Introduce alternative expression for transition rate that is minimized by exact committor at any lag time, with numerical tests on benchmark systems.

Result: New committor and transition rate estimates show much less sensitivity to lag time choice compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides more robust committor estimation, with connections to variational approaches and error decomposition analysis.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

Conclusion: Provides a novel geometric framework for analyzing higher-order interactions in complex systems through simplicial complexes, offering additional characterization tools beyond topological approaches.

Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order
interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the
pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to
capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution
of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial
complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated
with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the
spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of
associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as
characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex dynamics prediction is challenging due to nonlinearities and multiscale interactions in physics. Quantum reservoir computing leverages high-dimensional Hilbert space to overcome limitations of conventional forecasting methods.

Method: Hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture with 5-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, input-modulated dynamics, and temporal multiplexing for encoding signals across multiple timescales.

Result: Systematic parameter space scanning identified optimal regions maximizing forecasting performance (Valid Prediction Time). Model showed robustness and reliable performance for both Navier-Stokes truncations and Lorenz-63 chaotic systems.

Conclusion: The hybrid quantum approach provides a flexible platform for modeling complex nonlinear time series, demonstrating superior performance in chaotic fluid dynamics forecasting.

Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many
domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely
limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir
computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing
by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics
of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through
quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs
a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics
and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple
timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic
behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a
dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning
the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize
forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed
robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that
this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex
nonlinear time series.

Abstract: This work presents a biventricular electromechanical human heart model that
is comprehensive and clinically relevant, integrating a realistic 3D heart
geometry with both systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The model uses a
two-way fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) formulation with actual 3D blood
meshes to accurately investigate the effect of blood flow on the myocardium. It
couples a reaction-diffusion framework and a voltage-dependent active stress
term to replicate the link between electrical excitation and mechanical
contraction. Additionally, the model incorporates innovative epicardial
boundary conditions to mimic the stiffness and viscosity of neighboring
tissues. The model's ability to replicate physiological heart motion was
validated against Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which
demonstrated a high degree of consistency in regional displacement patterns.
The analysis of the right ventricle showed that the basal and mid free walls
experience the largest motion, making these regions ideal for implanting
motion-driven energy harvesting devices. This validated model is a robust tool
for enhancing our understanding of cardiac physiology and optimizing
therapeutic interventions before clinical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient function approximation on smooth manifolds while addressing computational challenges of high-dimensional data through scalable methods.

Method: Builds on Diffusion Maps framework, uses diffusion geometry connected to heat equation and Laplace-Beltrami operator. Implements SVD-based dimensionality reduction and online updating mechanism for new data incorporation.

Result: Numerical experiments show superior performance over classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly demonstrated in sparse CT reconstruction applications.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides an effective and scalable approach for function approximation on manifolds, successfully addressing high-dimensional computational challenges while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.
