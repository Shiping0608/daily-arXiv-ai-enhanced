Unlike traditional\ncontact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between\ntwo contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact\nconstraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different\napplications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a\ngeneralization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM)\ncan handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for\nmodeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the\nprojection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the\nrank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third\nmedium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which\nfurther complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the\nstabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to\nsolve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM,\nSFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the\nconstruction of the regularization term in third medium contact.

Our\nresults yield optimal time measurement bounds for such inverse coefficient\ndetermination problems. A central innovation is the use of Kahane's\ninterpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling\nthe recovery without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data,\nas in previous approaches.
