The amount of\nshock-capturing artificial viscosity is determined by a smoothness sensor that\nmeasures deviations from a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO)\nreconstruction. Since this kind of dissipative stabilization does not guarantee\nthat the nodal states of the finite element approximation stay in a convex\nadmissible set, we adaptively constrain deviations of these states from\nintermediate cell averages. The representation of our scheme in terms of such\ncell averages makes it possible to apply convex limiting techniques originally\ndesigned for positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods.\nAdapting these techniques to the continuous Galerkin setting and using\nBernstein polynomials as local basis functions, we prove the invariant domain\npreservation property under a time step restriction that can be significantly\nweakened by using a flux limiter for the auxiliary cell averages. The close\nrelationship to DG-WENO schemes is exploited and discussed. All algorithmic\nsteps can be implemented in a matrix-free and hardware-aware manner.

The\nsystem models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology\nframework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its\nsignificant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never\nbeen investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type\nnature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that\nrender conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions\nbeyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models.\nTechnically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between\nparabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications,\nwhile the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied\nperspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as\nsolutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity\nconstraints.

Here, molecular dynamics\nsimulations show that glassy particle shells do not primarily provide\nelongational cohesion. Instead, they amplify an underlying mechanism wherein\ncompetition between filler and elastomer networks causes the elastomer's volume\nto increase on deformation.

Trained on a diverse set\nof datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding\nsolutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON\nlearns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation\nto an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic\nframework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where\nit computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution\noperators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution\npairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the\nprobabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also\nproviding a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This\nprobabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to\n\\emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive\ndistribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON\n(GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which\nenables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in\noperator learning."}

The proof is based on generalizing an averaging argument due to Sun. We\nalso show that damping sets which attain these improvements are generic among\npolygons and smooth curves."}
