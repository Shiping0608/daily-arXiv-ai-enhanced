The overall system of equations is efficiently solved using a\nhybrid of the pseudo-transient method and the accelerated pseudo-transient\nmethod, balancing the convergence rate and numerical stability. A variety of\nnumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed PeTTO approach. These examples cover different\nphysics scenarios including mechanical and thermal problems, as well as\nsingle-material and multi-materials cases in both 2D and 3D.

However, conventional mixtures are often light-tailed, which\nleads to slow convergence and instability when targeting very small failure\nprobabilities. Moreover, selecting the number of mixture components in advance\ncan be difficult and may undermine stability. To overcome these challenges, we\nadopt a weighted cross-entropy-penalized expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm that automatically prunes redundant components during the iterative\nprocess, making the approach more stable. Furthermore, we introduce a novel\ntwo-component mixture that pairs a light-tailed distribution with a\nheavy-tailed one, enabling more effective exploration of the tail region and\nthus accelerating convergence for extremely small failure probabilities.

We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of\nCR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their\nfundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso\n(~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic,\nGalactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls\nand systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling,\nincluding: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment\nformalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or\nshear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM)\nobservations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing\nonly on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR\ntransport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from\nself-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We\nemphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived\nCR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons;\nnew methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent\nscattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to\nshow how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present\nphenomenological models which can be used in future simulations.

In particular we study sets that are suitably approximable at all\npoints and scales by calibrated planes and show that, without any additional\nhypotheses on $\\beta$-numbers, this implies measure upper bounds and\nrectifiability. This article follows the main techniques introduced in a\nprevious article, but it allows for holes in the sets under consideration, and\nis more self-contained."}

This paper introduces a dual\nformulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the\nhomogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and\nvariational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation\nof guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of\nPINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material\napproximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural\nnetwork-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs\nmay outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material\ndiscontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs\naccommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful\nselection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a\nreliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN\nframeworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in\nmicromechanics."}
