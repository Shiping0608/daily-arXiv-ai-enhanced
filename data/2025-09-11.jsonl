We begin with CMS preliminaries and formalize refinement\nin CMS, retaining key structural properties, such as locality. We prove a\nconvergence theorem under contractivity and demonstrate its applicability. To\naddress schemes where contractivity is unknown, we introduce two notions of\nproximity. Our proximity methods relate a nonlinear scheme to another nonlinear\nscheme with known contractivity, rather than to a linear scheme, as in much of\nthe literature. Specifically, the first type proximity compares the two schemes\nafter a single refinement step and, as in the classical theory, yields\nconvergence from sufficiently dense initial data. The proximity of the second\ntype monitors alignment across all refinement levels and provides strong\nconvergence without density assumptions. We formulate and prove the\ncorresponding theorems, and illustrate them with various examples, such as\nschemes over metric spaces of compact sets in $\\R^n$ and schemes over the\nWasserstein space, as well as a geometric Hermite metric space. These results\nextend subdivision theory beyond Euclidean and manifold-valued data for data in\nmetric spaces."}

This work tracks the\ncoupled evolution of Alfv\\'en-cyclotron (ACWs) and Ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) by\nsolving moment-based quasilinear equations for a collisionless plasma of\nbi-Maxwellian protons and Maxwellian electrons. Unlike earlier quasilinear\nstudies that adopt the cold-electron limit, our formulation retains the full\nkinetic response of both species, treating the electrons as a thermal reservoir\nto isolate proton heating. A parameter survey over $0.01\\leq\\beta_{\\parallel\np}\\leq10$ and $1\\le T_e/T_p\\le10$ shows that an ambient spectrum of ACWs can\ndrive significant perpendicular proton heating and raise the temperature\nanisotropy from initially isotropic conditions at low $\\beta_{\\parallel\np}\\lesssim0.1$, thereby triggering cyclotron instabilities. The quasilinear\nevolution self-regulates the ACW, driving the system toward a quasi-stationary\nstate with $\\gamma/\\Omega_p<10^{-1}$ and reduced anisotropy. As $T_e/T_p$\nincreases, IAWs become less damped and absorb a larger share of the fluctuation\nenergy through Landau resonance, reducing the efficiency of ACW-driven proton\nheating and thus regulating the instability. For sufficiently large\n$\\beta_{\\parallel p}$ or $T_e/T_p\\gtrsim5$, ACWs become inefficient drivers of\nperpendicular heating, leaving IAWs as the dominant dissipation channel.

Although it has\nbeen extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number\nof fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal\nregularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions,\nwe rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This\napproach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the\nliterature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \\{v\\in\nH^{1/2}(\\Omega);\\nabla v\\in [H^1/2(\\Omega)]'\\} for which the trace operator is\ncontinuous from $E$ into $L^2(\\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using\nspecific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results\nfor polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$\nholds in any BLD $\\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in\nthe literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which\nestablish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains.\nIn particular, we show that if $u\\in H^{1/2}(\\Omega)$ or $u\\in W^{1,\n2N/(N+1)}(\\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and vanishes on $\\Gamma$, then $u=\n0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties.\nFinally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate.

It stores the\ntemporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each\ntime step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing\nthe solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets\nlarge, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given\na representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which\nthe characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by\nrestarting the numerical flow iteration after certain time intervals. In this\npaper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of\nthe solution at the restart times using the blackbox approximation. The\nproposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure\nnumerical flow iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step\nwhile still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical\nresults demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the numerical\nflow iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the\nsemi-Lagrangian method."}

The focus thus far has been on methods that require\nclassical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness\nand optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in\ndemonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We\nconsider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's\nown data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.\nConcretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related\nlinear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to\nonline-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.\npreconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on\ntop of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its\neffectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems."}

Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are\npenalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\\chi^2$ divergence.\nWhile a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice,\nquadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we\nare not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on\nthe gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and\nsemi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its\nsolutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich\npotentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are\nstraightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter --\nin contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is\nthat gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between\nthe iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our\nanalysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the\noptimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These\ntechniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from\nthe approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport."}

This problem\narises naturally in applications such as risk management, the modeling of crowd\nmotion, and sliced partial transport algorithms for point cloud registration.\nUnlike higher-dimensional settings, the dual functional in the unidimensional\ncase exhibits reduced regularity. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a\nregularization procedure based on thickening the density along an auxiliary\ndimension. We prove that the maximizers of the regularized dual problem\nconverge to those of the original dual problem, with quadratic rate in the\nintroduced thickness. We further provide a numerical scheme that leverages the\nregularized functional, and we validate our analysis with simulations that\nconfirm the quadratic convergence rate.

A key milestone is solving the Navier-Stokes\nequations (NSE), which has remained formidable for quantum algorithms due to\ntheir high input-output overhead and nonlinearity. Here, we establish a\nfull-stack framework that charts a practical pathway to a quantum advantage for\nlarge-scale NSE simulation. Our approach integrates a spectral-based\ninput/output algorithm, an explicit and synthesized quantum circuit, and a\nrefined error-correction protocol. The algorithm achieves an end-to-end\nexponential speedup in asymptotic complexity, meeting the lower bound for\ngeneral quantum linear system solvers. Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis\nand optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical\nresources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis\ndemonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million\nphysical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days --\noutperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a\ncentury.
