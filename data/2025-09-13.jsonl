Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz\ndeflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses\nwith lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active\nshielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations,\nwhich are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of\nshield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and\nEnergy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method\nby which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various\nsimplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy,\nand therefore require evaluation and correction.

The updated model predicts improved performance\nfor weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished\nperformance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m.\nOverall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass\nsavings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose\nreduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most\nexploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside\nLEO."}

However, accurate modelling of regions of separation\nat the head of the blunted containers and at unloaded gap sections is essential\nfor precise predictions of pressure magnitudes. This has traditionally been\ndifficult to capture with 1D models. Furthermore, achieving this accuracy\nthrough 3D computational methods demands exceptional mesh quality, significant\ncomputational resources, and the careful selection of numerical models. This\npaper evaluates various numerical models to capture these complexities within\nregions of flow separation. Findings have supported the development of a new 1D\nprogramme to calculate the pressure wave generated by a freight locomotive\nentering a tunnel, and is here further extended to consider the discontinuities\nof the train body created by intermodal container loading patterns, by\nimplementing new mesh system and boundary conditions into the 1D programme. A\nparameterisation study for different loading configurations is also presented\nto improve the overall programme adaptability, and the relationship between\npredetermined parameters and gap length is investigated. We validate the\neffectiveness of the improved 1D model through comprehensive Large Eddy\nSimulation (LES) results and conduct an extensive parameterisation study to\nenhance its applicability across various loading configurations.
