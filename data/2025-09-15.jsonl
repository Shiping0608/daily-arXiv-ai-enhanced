The whole picture is even more\ncomplicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive\nmedia, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group)\nvelocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be\nconducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in\nspace. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial\nboundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally\nfollows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM:\nM2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary\nconditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and\ntwo space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at\nleast for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves\nregardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several\napproaches to handle the fact that q > N , we elect the so-called ''scalar''\napproach (which despite its name, also works when N > 1) as method of choice\nfor more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the\ncoefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion\nrelation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in\nthe spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide\ntruncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of\npast time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing\ncoefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using\nfloating-point arithmetic or not.

The possibility of effectively converting\nthe translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the\nsystem axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A\nconnection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of\nelectrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday\neffect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated\nwith the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor\nhas no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially\nattractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a\nmagnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The\ntheory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which\ncorresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects.

The Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation is one of the most\nimportant phase field models and is widely applied in materials science.

However, compared to its\nclassic counterpart, it is very challenging to investigate the long-term\nasymptotic behavior of solution to the N-CH equation due to the complexity of\nthe nonlocal integral term and the lack of high-order diffusion term.

These solutions are global in time, they do not reduce to\nstationary solutions in any moving reference frame and they are approximately\ngiven by finite sums of Stokes waves traveling with rationally independent\nspeeds of propagation. This is a very hard small divisors problem for Partial\nDifferential Equations due to the fact that one deals with a dispersive\nquasi-linear PDE in higher dimension with a very complicated geometry of the\nresonances.

We explore an\nalternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical\nalgorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and\nguided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on\nboth criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly\nwithout fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from\nfine-tuning.
