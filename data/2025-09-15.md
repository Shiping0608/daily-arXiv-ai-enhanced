### [1] [The high-order Hermite discrete correction function method for surface-driven electromagnetic problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09857)
*Yann-Meing Law*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel discrete correction function method is proposed to handle boundary and interface conditions for the high-order Hermite-Taylor method on staggered Cartesian meshes, enabling accurate simulations of Maxwell's equations and other wave systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hermite-Taylor method requires data at each node of staggered Cartesian meshes, making boundary and interface condition enforcement challenging, which limits its application to complex problems.

Method: Proposes a discrete correction function method that provides all necessary data near surfaces where conditions are enforced, allowing the Hermite-Taylor method to handle variable coefficients, discontinuous solutions, and generalized transition conditions.

Result: The method demonstrates flexibility across various problems including those with variable coefficients and discontinuous interfaces, with numerical examples in 2D verifying its properties and long-time simulation capabilities.

Conclusion: The Hermite-Taylor discrete correction function method successfully addresses boundary/interface challenges, making high-order simulations possible for Maxwell's equations and adaptable to other linear wave systems.

Abstract: The Hermite-Taylor method evolves all the variables and their derivatives
through order $m$ in time to achieve a $2m+1$ order rate of convergence. The
data required at each node of the staggered Cartesian meshes used by this
method makes the enforcement of boundary and interface conditions challenging.
In this work, we propose a novel correction function method, referred to as the
discrete correction function method, which provides all the data required by
the Hermite method near the surface where a condition is enforced. The
flexibility of the resulting Hermite-Taylor discrete correction function method
is demonstrated by considering a wide range of problems, including those with
variable coefficients, discontinuous solutions at the interface, and
generalized sheet transition conditions. Although the focus of this work is on
Maxwell's equations, this high-order method can be adapted to other linear wave
systems. Several numerical examples in two space dimensions are performed to
verify the properties of the proposed method, including long-time simulations.

### [2] [A streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method for the magnetic advection-diffusion problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09913)
*Haochen Li,Yangfan Luo,Jindong Wang,Shuonan Wu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Development of an SUPG method for magnetic advection-diffusion with stabilization terms based on residuals and weighted advection, featuring a lifting operator for interface jumps and nonlinear extension for oscillation reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address numerical challenges in magnetic advection-diffusion problems, particularly oscillations in sharp layers, by developing a stabilized finite element method.

Method: SUPG-type stabilization with residual-based terms, lifting operator for interface jumps, discrete magnetic advection operator, and nonlinear extension for enhanced stabilization.

Result: Established scheme stability and optimal error estimates under mild assumptions. Numerical examples in 2D/3D demonstrate theoretical convergence and effective stabilization properties.

Conclusion: The proposed SUPG method provides effective stabilization for magnetic advection-diffusion problems with proven stability and optimal error estimates, successfully reducing numerical oscillations in sharp layers.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and analysis of a streamline
upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the magnetic advection-diffusion
problem. A key feature of the method is an SUPG-type stabilization term based
on the residuals and weighted advection terms of the test function. By
introducing a lifting operator to characterize the jumps of finite element
functions across element interfaces, we define a discrete magnetic advection
operator, which subsequently enables the formulation of the desired SUPG
method. Under mild assumptions, we establish the stability of the scheme and
derive optimal error estimates. Furthermore, by introducing a stabilization
term that depends on the residual, we propose a nonlinear extension aimed at
more effectively reducing numerical oscillations in sharp layers. Numerical
examples in both two and three dimensions are provided to demonstrate the
theoretical convergence and stabilization properties of the proposed method.

### [3] [Perfectly transparent boundary conditions and wave propagation in lattice Boltzmann schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10066)
*Thomas Bellotti*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic method for developing perfectly transparent boundary conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes that absorb both physical and spurious waves in linear 1D and 2D problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulations on bounded domains require transparent boundary conditions to prevent artificial boundaries from acting as mirrors that produce polluting ricochets, especially important for multi-step schemes with both physical and spurious waves.

Method: The 'scalar' approach that computes coefficients of Laurent series at infinity of roots of the dispersion relation, using asymptotics from analytic combinatorics to guide truncation and ensure numerical stability.

Result: Numerical investigations in 1D and 2D with N=1 and 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed perfectly transparent boundary conditions.

Conclusion: The method provides systematic development of boundary conditions that absorb all wave types regardless of frequency, with practical guidance for implementation using floating-point arithmetic.

Abstract: Systems of N = 1, 2, . . . first-order hyperbolic conservation laws feature N
undamped waves propagating at finite speeds. On their own hand, multi-step
Finite Difference and lattice Boltzmann schemes with q = N + 1, N + 2, . . .
unknowns involve N ''physical'' waves, which are aimed at being as
closely-looking as possible to the ones of the PDEs, and q-N
''numerical-spurious-parasitic'' waves, which are subject to their own speed of
propagation, and either damped or undamped. The whole picture is even more
complicated in the discrete setting-as numerical schemes act as dispersive
media, thus propagate different harmonics at different phase (and group)
velocities. For compelling practical reasons, simulations must always be
conducted on bounded domains, even when the target problem is unbounded in
space. The importance of transparent boundary conditions, preventing artificial
boundaries from acting as mirrors producing polluting ricochets, naturally
follows. This work presents, building on Besse, Coulombel, and Noble [ESAIM:
M2AN, 55 (2021)], a systematic way of developing perfectly transparent boundary
conditions for lattice Boltzmann schemes tackling linear problems in one and
two space dimensions. Our boundary conditions are ''perfectly'' transparent, at
least for 1D problems, as they absorb both physical and spurious waves
regardless of their frequency. After presenting, in a simple framework, several
approaches to handle the fact that q > N , we elect the so-called ''scalar''
approach (which despite its name, also works when N > 1) as method of choice
for more involved problems. This method solely relies on computing the
coefficients of the Laurent series at infinity of the roots of the dispersion
relation of the bulk scheme. We insist on asymptotics for these coefficients in
the spirit of analytic combinatorics. The reason is two-fold: asymptotics guide
truncation of boundary conditions to make them depending on a fixed number of
past time-steps, and make it clearduring the process of computing
coefficients-whether intermediate quantities can be safely stored using
floating-point arithmetic or not. Numerous numerical investigations in 1D and
2D with N = 1 and 2 are carried out, and show the effectiveness of the proposed
boundary conditions.

### [4] [A Spectral Localization Method for Time-Fractional Integro-Differential Equations with Nonsmooth Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10091)
*Lijing Zhao,Rui Zhao,Wenyi Tian,Yufeng Nie*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations using contour integral method for temporal discretization and finite element method for spatial discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for time-fractional integro-differential equations that can handle problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Combines contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours for temporal discretization to approximate nonlocal operators, and standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) for spatial discretization.

Result: The scheme achieves spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space, even for problems with low regularity. Numerical experiments in 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully combines spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations with low regularity requirements.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity
requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First,
a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal
discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized
hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial
discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method
(FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that
the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with
nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring
spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a
series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical
findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral
accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.

### [5] [Neural network-based singularity detection and applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10110)
*Nadiia Derevianko,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Felix Dietrich*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel method for constructing shallow neural networks that learn univariate meromorphic functions with pole singularities using Laurent coefficients, rational activation functions, and backpropagation-free training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient neural network approach for approximating meromorphic functions with singularities, particularly useful for studying complex plane extensions of PDE solutions and singularity dynamics.

Method: Uses FFT-computed Laurent coefficients from function values on a complex contour, adaptive rational polynomial activation functions with single poles, backpropagation-free hidden layer weight determination, and least-squares output layer fitting.

Result: The method demonstrates locally uniform convergence and effectiveness in numerical experiments, including constructing complex plane extensions of nonlinear PDE solutions and studying singularity dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach successfully breaks from traditional 'safe' rational activation functions by strategically placing poles to capture singularities, providing an effective framework for meromorphic function approximation with proven convergence properties.

Abstract: We present a method for constructing a special type of shallow neural network
that learns univariate meromorphic functions with pole-type singularities. Our
method is based on using a finite set of Laurent coefficients as input
information, which we compute by FFT, employing values of the investigated
function on some contour $\Gamma$ in the complex plane. The primary components
of our methodology are the following: (1) the adaptive construction of rational
polynomial activation functions, (2) a novel backpropagation-free method for
determining the weights and biases of the hidden layer, and (3) the computation
of the weights and biases of the output layer through least-squares fitting.
Breaking with the idea of "safe" rational activation functions, we introduce a
rational activation function as a meromorphic function with a single pole
situated within the domain of investigation. Employing the weights and biases
of the hidden layer, we then scale and shift the pole of the activation
function to find the estimated locations of the singularities; this implies
that the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined by the number of
singularities of the function that is being approximated. While the weights and
biases of the hidden layer are tuned so as to capture the singularities, the
least-squares fitting for the computation of weights and biases of the output
layer ensures approximation of the function in the rest of the domain. Through
the use of Laurent-Pad\'e rational approximation concepts, we prove locally
uniform convergence of our method. We illustrate the effectiveness of our
method through numerical experiments, including the construction of extensions
of the time-dependent solutions of nonlinear autonomous PDEs into the complex
plane, and study the dynamics of their singularities.

### [6] [The low-rank tensor-train finite difference method for three-dimensional parabolic equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10142)
*Gianmarco Manzini,Tommaso Sorgente*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Tensor-train based low-rank approximation framework for 3D parabolic problems that achieves massive time/memory savings while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical framework for solving high-dimensional parabolic problems that overcomes the computational limitations of traditional approaches through tensor decomposition techniques.

Method: Combines finite difference method with explicit/implicit Euler and Crank-Nicolson schemes, using tensor-train reformulation and matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient method to exploit variable separation.

Result: The tensor-train design provides robust and highly efficient performance with massive time and memory savings while maintaining almost identical accuracy to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The method is particularly suitable for tackling challenging high-dimensional problems due to its computational efficiency and accuracy preservation.

Abstract: This paper presents a numerical framework for the low-rank approximation of
the solution to three-dimensional parabolic problems. The key contribution of
this work is the tensorization process based on a tensor-train reformulation of
the second-order accurate finite difference method. We advance the solution in
time by combining the finite difference method with an explicit and implicit
Euler method and with the Crank-Nicolson method. We solve the linear system
arising at each time step from the implicit and semi-implicit time-marching
schemes through a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method,
appositely designed to exploit the separation of variables induced by the
tensor-train format. We assess the performance of our method through extensive
numerical experimentation, demonstrating that the tensor-train design offers a
robust and highly efficient alternative to the traditional approach. Indeed,
the usage of this type of representation leads to massive time and memory
savings while guaranteeing almost identical accuracy with respect to the
traditional one. These features make the method particularly suitable to tackle
challenging high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: UGKWP provides a scalable and accurate approach for multiscale neutron transport simulation, capable of handling complex geometries and smooth transitions between different transport regimes.

Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is proposed for the
neutron transport equation, addressing the inherent multiscale nature of
neutron propagation in both optically thin and thick regimes. UGKWP couples
macroscopic diffusion and microscopic transport processes within a unified

3D multi-group problems, are studied, indicating UGKWP a promising framework
for scalable and accurate simulation of multigroup neutron transport in complex
geometries.

### [8] [Convergence to equilibrium for fully discretizations of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10180)
*Danni Zhang,Dongling Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of long-term asymptotic behavior for numerical solutions of the Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation using energy-stable temporal and spatial discretization schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation better describes material microstructural phase transitions but is challenging to analyze due to nonlocal integral terms and lack of high-order diffusion, requiring rigorous numerical stability analysis.

Method: Developed first-order and second-order temporal discretization methods combined with second-order finite difference spatial approximation to construct energy-stable fully discrete numerical schemes.

Result: Proved that numerical solutions converge to equilibrium as time approaches infinity, based on energy stability and Łojasiewicz inequality analysis.

Conclusion: Successfully established theoretical foundation for long-term asymptotic behavior of numerical solutions to the Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation, demonstrating convergence to equilibrium states.

Abstract: The study of long-term dynamics for numerical solutions of nonlinear
evolution equations, particularly phase field models, has consistently garnered
considerable attention. The Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation is one of the most
important phase field models and is widely applied in materials science. In
order to more accurately describe the practical phenomena in material
microstructural phase transitions, the Nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard (N-CH) equation
incorporates a finite range of spatial nonlocal interactions is introduced,
which is a generalization of the classic CH equation. However, compared to its
classic counterpart, it is very challenging to investigate the long-term
asymptotic behavior of solution to the N-CH equation due to the complexity of
the nonlocal integral term and the lack of high-order diffusion term. In this
paper, we consider first-order and second-order temporal discretization methods
for the N-CH equation, respectively, while utilizing a second-order finite
difference method for spatial approximation to construct the energy stable
fully discrete numerical schemes. Based on energy stability and the
{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, we rigorously prove that the numerical solutions of
these fully discrete numerical schemes converge to equilibrium as time goes to
infinity.

*Dominik Still,Niklas Fehn,Wolfgang A. Wall,Martin Kronbichler*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel matrix-free methods for Galerkin discretizations on tetrahedral grids achieve 60% peak performance through dense matrix-matrix products and hierarchical mesh reordering, delivering 6x speedup over sparse matrix approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve node-level performance of matrix-free evaluation for continuous/discontinuous Galerkin methods on unstructured tetrahedral grids, addressing computational efficiency challenges in finite-element operators.

Method: Cell-by-cell numerical quadrature using tabulated dense local matrices, dense matrix-matrix products instead of matrix-vector products, explicit data parallelism, hierarchical mesh reordering for data locality, and hybrid multigrid preconditioning.

Result: Achieves over 60% of peak performance, up to 6x speedup compared to global sparse matrix-based approach at polynomial degree 3, with demonstrated effectiveness on Poisson and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The matrix-free implementation shows strong scaling potential for large real-world problems, with optimal efficiency achieved through strategic transitions between matrix-free and matrix-based approaches in preconditioners.

Abstract: This study presents novel strategies for improving the node-level performance
of matrix-free evaluation of continuous and discontinuous Galerkin spatial
discretizations on unstructured tetrahedral grids. In our approach the
underlying integrals of a generic finite-element operator are computed
cell-by-cell through numerical quadrature using tabulated dense local matrices
of shape functions, achieving high throughput for low to moderate-order
polynomial degrees. By employing dense matrix-matrix products instead of
matrix-vector products for the cell-wise interpolation, the method reaches over
$60\%$ of peak performance. The optimization strategies exploit explicit data
parallelism to enhance computational efficiency, complemented by a hierarchical
mesh reordering algorithm that improves data locality. The matrix-free
implementation achieves up to a $6\times$ speedup compared to a global sparse
matrix-based approach at a polynomial degree of three. The effectiveness of the
method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on the Poisson and
Navier--Stokes equations. The Poisson operator is preconditioned by a hybrid
multigrid scheme that combines auxiliary continuous finite-element spaces,
polynomial and geometric coarsening where possible while employing algebraic
multigrid on the coarse mesh. Within the preconditioner, the implementation
transitions between the matrix-free and matrix-based strategies for optimal
efficiency. Finally, we analyze the strong scaling behavior of the Poisson and
Helmholtz operators, demonstrating the method's potential to solve large
real-world problems.

### [10] [Near-Optimal Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300)
*Meng Huang,Jinming Wen,Ran Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: PhaseLift algorithm's noise stability analysis shows near-optimal recovery bounds scaling with average noise magnitude ‖w‖₂/√m, confirming Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PhaseLift recovery bounds scale with ‖w‖₂ which is conjectured to be suboptimal, while the optimal bound should scale with average noise magnitude ‖w‖₂/√m - this theoretical gap remains an open problem.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving recovery bounds under adversarial noise and mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise, establishing both upper bounds and matching lower bounds for PhaseLift algorithm.

Result: Proved recovery error bound of O(log n · ‖w‖₂/√m) under adversarial noise, and O(σ√(n log⁴ n/m)) for sub-Gaussian noise, with corresponding minimax lower bounds confirming near-optimal scaling.

Conclusion: Results affirm Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic factors, providing new insights into PhaseLift stability under noisy coded diffraction pattern measurements.

Abstract: The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase
retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns
(CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the
noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well
understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive
noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on
the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More
recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound
should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of
$\|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is
considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper,
we focus on this conjecture and provide a nearly optimal recovery bound for it.
We prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is
bounded by $O(\log n \cdot \|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m)$, and further show that
there exists a noise vector for which the error lower bound exceeds
$O\bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}} \cdot \frac{\|\mathbf{w}\|_2}{\sqrt m}\bigr)$.
Here, $n$ is the dimension of the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for
mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb R^m$ with
sub-Gaussian norm $\sigma$, we establish a bound of order $O\bigl(\sigma
\sqrt{\frac{n \log^4 n}{m}}\bigr)$, and also provide a corresponding minimax
lower bound. Our results affirm Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic
factors, providing a new insight into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy
CDP measurements.

*Marco Artiano,Oswald Knoth,Peter Spichtinger,Hendrik Ranocha*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Structure-preserving numerical methods for compressible Euler equations using potential temperature as prognostic variable, with entropy and energy conservation in discontinuous Galerkin framework on curvilinear meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop numerical methods that preserve physical structure (entropy and energy conservation) for atmospheric flow simulations using potential temperature formulation, which is more natural for atmospheric applications than traditional Euler equations.

Method: Constructed three numerical fluxes for discontinuous Galerkin framework on curvilinear meshes, employed flux-differencing approach for gravitational source term discretization, developed well-balanced schemes for constant background states.

Result: Successfully developed structure-preserving methods that maintain entropy and total energy conservation, generalized kinetic energy preservation with gravitational potential, and created well-balanced schemes for atmospheric scenarios.

Conclusion: The potential temperature formulation provides effective structure-preserving numerical methods for atmospheric flow simulations, validated against traditional Euler equations across various classical atmospheric test cases.

Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler
equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable.We
construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy
and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general
curvilinear meshes.Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic
energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a
gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing
approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative
product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background
states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on
curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential
temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across
a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.

### [12] [Numerical analysis of the large deviation regime of a kinetic equation with a nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10323)
*Hélène Hivert,Tino Laidin*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: AP numerical scheme for linear kinetic equation in large deviation regime, handles stiffness efficiently with uniform computational cost, captures nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for kinetic equations in rare event regimes that can handle stiffness from scaling and correctly capture the asymptotic limit to non-standard nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

Method: Asymptotic-preserving scheme using Hopf-Cole transform, leveraging conservation properties of original kinetic model. Uses discrete maximum principle and equilibrium preservation. Introduces new analytical tools based on discrete representation formula for convergence analysis.

Result: Scheme efficiently handles stiffness with uniform computational cost, satisfies discrete maximum principle, preserves equilibrium states, and correctly captures asymptotic limit to viscosity solution of nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme is robust and effective for rare event simulations in kinetic equations, with proven convergence properties and numerical validation showing correct asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We develop and study an asymptotic-preserving (AP) numerical scheme for a
linear kinetic equation in a large deviation regime. After applying a Hopf-Cole
transform to the distribution function, the system exhibits the behavior of
rare events, which in the limit is governed by a non-standard, nonlocal
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, as identified in [E. Bouin et al., J. Lond. Math.
Soc., II. Ser., 2023].
  The proposed scheme efficiently handles the stiffness introduced by scaling,
with a computational cost that remains uniform with respect to the small
parameter. It takes advantage of the conservation properties of the original
kinetic model to overcome the numerical challenges posed by stiffness. The
scheme satisfies a discrete maximum principle, preserves equilibrium states,
and correctly captures the asymptotic limit, recovering the viscosity solution
of the limit nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
  As the limit problem is non-standard, convergence results from the literature
are not directly applicable. We introduce new analytical tools based on a
discrete representation formula that links the numerical scheme with the
continuous setting. This allows us to prove the convergence and establish key
structural properties of the method. Numerical tests support the analysis and
illustrate the robustness of the scheme and the original behavior of the limit
system.

*Oussama Ounissi,Masato Kimura,Hirofumi Notsu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Mathematical analysis of spring constant matrix symmetry and positive-definiteness in spring-block systems for 2D/3D elastic bodies using P1 FEM with triangular meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical foundations for spring-block systems used in fracture simulations of elastic bodies, ensuring the spring constant matrix derived from finite element methods has proper symmetry and positive-definiteness properties.

Method: Used P1 finite element method with triangular meshes for linear elasticity equations, mathematically analyzed symmetry and positive-definiteness of the derived d×d spring constant matrix, and conducted numerical experiments to validate theoretical results.

Result: Proved symmetry of spring constant matrix in unified manner for both 2D and 3D cases (new result for 3D), provided necessary/sufficient conditions for positive-definiteness with isotropic elasticity tensor, and confirmed results numerically.

Conclusion: The spring constant derived from FEM maintains symmetry and positive-definiteness under proper conditions, which is crucial for reliable fracture simulations using spring-block systems in elastic body modeling.

Abstract: In this study, we consider a spring-block system that approximates a
$d$-dimensional linear elastic body, where $d=2$ or $d=3$. We derive a $d\times
d$ matrix as the spring constant using the P1 finite element method with a
triangular mesh for the linear elasticity equations. We mathematically analyze
the symmetry and positive-definiteness of the spring constant. Even if we
assume full symmetry of the elasticity tensor, the symmetry of the matrix
obtained as the spring constant is not trivial. However, we have succeeded in
proving this in a unified manner for both 2D and 3D cases. This is an
alternative proof for the 2D case in Notsu-Kimura (2014) and is a new result
for the 3D case. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the spring
constant to be positive-definite in the case of an isotropic elasticity tensor,
along with a sufficient condition in terms of mesh regularity and the Poisson
ratio. These theoretical results are supported by several numerical
experiments. The positive-definiteness of the spring constant derived from the
finite element method plays a vital role in fracture simulations of elastic
bodies using the spring-block system.

*Wael Mattar,Nir Sharon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A multiscale framework for analyzing sequences of probability measures in Wasserstein spaces using optimal transport geometry, with applications in denoising, anomaly detection, and neural network analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust multiscale analysis method for probability measure sequences that can handle both continuous and discrete measures while preserving the geometric structure of optimal transport spaces.

Method: Constructs a multiscale transform using McCann's interpolants as a refinement operator, introduces optimality number to quantify deviations from Wasserstein geodesicity, and establishes theoretical guarantees for stability and geometric decay.

Result: The framework provides theoretical stability guarantees, enables detection of irregular dynamics and anomalies across scales, and demonstrates versatility through numerical experiments including Gaussian flow denoising and neural network trajectory analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed multiscale framework offers a geometrically consistent and robust approach for analyzing measure sequences in Wasserstein spaces with applications in various domains requiring multiscale characterization of dynamic systems.

Abstract: We present a novel multiscale framework for analyzing sequences of
probability measures in Wasserstein spaces over Euclidean domains. Exploiting
the intrinsic geometry of optimal transport, we construct a multiscale
transform applicable to both absolutely continuous and discrete measures.
Central to our approach is a refinement operator based on McCann's
interpolants, which preserves the geodesic structure of measure flows and
serves as an upsampling mechanism. Building on this, we introduce the
optimality number, a scalar that quantifies deviations of a sequence from
Wasserstein geodesicity across scales, enabling the detection of irregular
dynamics and anomalies. We establish key theoretical guarantees, including
stability of the transform and geometric decay of coefficients, ensuring
robustness and interpretability of the multiscale representation. Finally, we
demonstrate the versatility of our methodology through numerical experiments:
denoising and anomaly detection in Gaussian flows, analysis of point cloud
dynamics under vector fields, and the multiscale characterization of neural
network learning trajectories.

### [15] [Zeroes of Eigenfunctions of Schrödinger Operators after Schwartzman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09739)
*Willie Wai-Yeung Wong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A direct PDE proof for Schwartzman's theorem on constant phase of non-vanishing kernel elements of Schrodinger operators with signed imaginary potential


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more direct and strengthened PDE-based proof of Schwartzman's result about constant phase properties in Schrodinger operators, avoiding the original dynamical systems approach

Method: Develops a direct PDE argument that strengthens Schwartzman's theorem for Schrodinger operators -Δ_g + V on Riemannian manifolds with boundary, where Im(V) is signed

Result: Proves strengthened versions of the constant phase property for non-vanishing elements in the kernel of such Schrodinger operators

Conclusion: The manuscript successfully provides a more direct PDE approach that yields stronger results than the original dynamical systems method used by Schwartzman

Abstract: Consider a complete, connected, smooth, oriented Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$
with boundary, such that the first Betti number vanishes. Sol Schwartzman
proved that for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $-\Delta_g + V$ where
$\Im(V)$ is signed, if $f: M\to\mathbb{C}$ is a non-vanishing element of its
kernel, then $f$ has constant phase. The proof relied on dynamical systems
methods applied to the gradient flow of the phase of $f$. In this manuscript we
provide a more direct PDE argument that proves strengthened versions of the
same facts.

### [16] [Local uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions for regular Liouville systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09781)
*Zetao Cheng,Haoyu Li,Lei Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study of Liouville systems on compact Riemann surfaces, establishing uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions with refined techniques for precise pointwise estimates and Fredholm theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize results from single Liouville equations to systems, overcoming substantial difficulties in handling continuum of standard bubbles and limited information from Pohozaev identity.

Method: Develop refined techniques for extremely precise pointwise estimates, extend tools to general framework, create useful Fredholm theory, and extend pointwise estimates to any finite order.

Result: Established uniqueness and non-degeneracy of blowup solutions for Liouville systems under natural assumptions, significantly generalizing previous single equation results.

Conclusion: Successfully addressed considerable differences between systems and single equations, developing novel analytical tools and achieving highly precise estimates that are distinct from single equation analyses.

Abstract: We study the following Liouville system defined on a compact Riemann surface
$M$, \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u_i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\rho_j\Big(\frac{h_j e^{u_j}}{\int_\Omega h_j
e^{u_j}}-1\Big)\mbox{ in }M\mbox{ for }i=1,\cdots,n,\nonumber \end{equation}
where the coefficient matrix $A=(a_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is nonnegative, $h_1,
\ldots, h_n$ are positive smooth functions, and $\rho_1, \ldots, \rho_n$ are
positive constants. For the blowup solutions, we establish their uniqueness and
non-degeneracy based on natural assumptions. The main results significantly
generalize corresponding results for single Liouville equations
\cite{BartJevLeeYang2019,BartYangZhang20241,BartYangZhang20242}. To overcome
several substantial difficulties, we develop certain tools and extend them into
a more general framework applicable to similar situations. Notably, to address
the considerable challenge of a continuum of standard bubbles, we refine the
techniques from Huang-Zhang \cite{HuangZhang2022} and Zhang
\cite{Zhang2006,Zhang2009} to achieve extremely precise pointwise estimates.
Additionally, to address the limited information provided by the Pohozaev
identity, we develop a useful Fredholm theory to discern the exact role that
the Pohozaev identity plays for systems. The considerable difference between
systems and a single equation is also reflected in the location of blowup
points, where the uncertainty of the energy type of the blowup point makes it
difficult to determine the sufficiency of pointwise estimates. In this regard,
we extend our highly precise pointwise estimates to any finite order. This
aspect is drastically distinct from analyses of single equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize regimes where the system remains globally well-posed despite arbitrary growth of nonlinear source terms and absence of damping mechanisms.

Method: Using nonlinear semigroup theory and monotone operator theory to establish local strong/weak solutions well-posedness, examining Nehari manifold for global existence of potential well solutions.

Result: Established well-posedness of both local strong and weak solutions, along with conditions for global existence. Characterized regimes maintaining global well-posedness despite nonlinear source growth.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies conditions under which the coupled wave-plate system remains globally well-posed even with arbitrary nonlinear source growth and no damping, using advanced mathematical frameworks.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider a structural acoustic model consisting of a
wave equation defined in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$,
strongly coupled with a Berger plate equation acting on the flat portion of the
boundary of $\Omega$. The system is influenced by an arbitrary $C^1$ nonlinear
source term in the plate equation. Using nonlinear semigroup theory and
monotone operator theory, we establish the well-posedness of both local strong
and weak solutions, along with conditions for global existence. With additional
assumptions on the source term, we examine the Nehari manifold and establish
the global existence of potential well solutions. Our primary objective is to
characterize regimes in which the system remains globally well-posed despite
arbitrary growth of the source term and the absence of damping mechanisms to
stabilize the dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rigorous mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent mechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture, extending previous static homogenization studies to include path-dependent dissipation.

Method: Starting from rate-independent discrete spring lattice combining local elasticity, gradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links, establish discrete-to-continuum limit in energetic formulation as lattice spacing tends to zero.

Result: Proved evolutionary solution convergence to unique energetic solution of continuum limit problem coupling classical elastoplasticity with non-local energy featuring fractional-order interactions capturing homogenized random long-range reinforcements.

Conclusion: Successfully extended static homogenization to time-dependent case, showing existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of evolving solutions, providing mathematical foundation for composite material simulation.

Abstract: We investigate the time-evolution of elastoplastic materials reinforced by
randomly distributed long-range interactions. Starting from a rate-independent
system on a discrete spring lattice that combines local linearized elasticity,
gradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links modeling stiff
fibers, we establish a discrete-to-continuum limit in the energetic
formulation. We prove that as the lattice spacing tends to zero, an
evolutionary solution of the discrete system converges to the unique energetic
solution of a continuum limit problem. The limiting continuum model couples
classical elastoplasticity with a non-local energy featuring fractional-order
interactions that capture the homogenized influence of random long-range
reinforcements. These results extend previous static homogenization studies by
rigorously treating path-dependent dissipation and showing existence,
uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of the evolving solutions. The work
therefore provides a mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent
mechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture.

Motivation: To complement recent work that provided only sufficient conditions for existence/nonexistence of global solutions, and to establish complete necessary and sufficient conditions for the mixed operator case

Method: Mathematical analysis of semilinear heat equations with mixed local-nonlocal operator -Δ + (-Δ)^σ under general time-dependent nonlinearity conditions

Result: Obtains necessary and sufficient conditions for global solution nonexistence, recovers critical Fujita exponent for time-independent power-type nonlinearities consistent with previous works

Conclusion: Completes the theoretical framework by providing both necessary and sufficient conditions for global solution behavior in mixed local-nonlocal heat equations, confirming and extending previous partial results

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish \emph{necessary and sufficient

*Ben Duan,Jun Li,Bin Guo,Rongrong Yan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Derived Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System from Klein-Gordon equation via Madelung transformation to analyze semiclassical and non-relativistic limits, and established local classical solutions for the Cauchy problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Klein-Gordon equation couples quantum and relativistic parameters, making direct analysis of quantum fluctuations difficult. A new approach was needed to study singular limits like semiclassical and non-relativistic limits.

Method: Used Madelung transformation on Klein-Gordon equation with Poisson effects to derive Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System. Reformulated it as a hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system and established local classical solutions for Cauchy problem with perturbed initial density.

Result: The derived system reduces to Relativistic Hydrodynamics System in semiclassical limit and to Quantum Hydrodynamics System in relativistic limit. Local classical solutions were established for Cauchy problem with small density perturbations.

Conclusion: The Madelung transformation provides an effective framework for analyzing singular limits in relativistic quantum systems, and the hyperbolic-elliptic formulation enables rigorous mathematical analysis of solutions.

Abstract: In the Klein-Gordon equation, the quantum and relativistic parameters are
intricately coupled, which complicates the direct consideration of quantum
fluctuations. In this paper, the so-called Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics
System is derived from the Klein-Gordon equation with Poisson effects via the
Madelung transformation, providing a fresh perspective for analyzing the
singular limits, such as the semi-classical limits and non-relativistic limits.
The Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamics System, when the semiclassical limit is
taken, formally reduces to the Relativistic Hydrodynamics System. When the
relativistic limit is taken, it formally reduces to the Quantum Hydrodynamics
System. Additionally, we establish the local classical solutions for the Cauchy
problem associated with the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System. The
initial density value is assumed to be a small perturbation of some constant
state, but the other initial values do not require this restriction. The key
point is that the Relativistic Quantum Hydrodynamic System is reformulated as a
hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with general contact angles outside arbitrary convex sets, extending the known Choe-Ghomi-Ritoré inequality beyond the right angle case.

Method: Mathematical analysis proving that capillary energy of any surface on convex sets exceeds that of spherical caps with same volume and contact angle on flat supports, with characterization of equality cases.

Result: Complete solution showing spherical caps on flat supports minimize capillary energy for any contact angle, with equality only for these configurations.

Conclusion: The isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces is fully resolved - spherical caps on flat supports are the unique minimizers across all contact angles, generalizing previous specialized results.

Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with a general
contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside arbitrary convex sets. We prove
that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex set is
larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact
angle on a flat support, and we characterize the equality cases. This provides
a complete solution to the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces outside
convex sets at arbitrary contact angles, generalizing the well-known
Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e inequality, which corresponds to the case
$\theta=\frac\pi2$.

Conclusion: Establishes deeper connection between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs in the context of fractional diffusion with mixed operators

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a class of evolution
equations arising from random-time changes driven by subordinators. Our focus
is on fractional diffusion equations involving mixed local and nonlocal

TL;DR: Analysis of long-time behavior of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with kinetic rate dependent boundary conditions, establishing global attractors, stability, exponential attractors, and convergence to equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-time dynamics of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations with kinetic rate dependent boundary conditions, which model bulk-surface interactions in materials science and phase separation phenomena.

Method: Mathematical analysis using complete metric spaces, strict separation property techniques, short trajectory methods, generalized Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality, and Alikakos-Moser type iteration for singular potentials including logarithmic potential.

Result: Established existence of global attractors α_m^L for all L∈[0,∞), stability of α_m^0 under small perturbations, existence of exponential attractors with finite fractal dimension for L∈(0,∞), and convergence of global weak solutions to single equilibrium in ℓ^∞ norm.

Conclusion: The nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with kinetic rate dependent boundary conditions exhibits rich dynamical behavior with stable global attractors and convergence to equilibrium states, providing comprehensive understanding of long-time dynamics for this class of equations.

Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard equation
in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d=2,3)$, subject to a kinetic
rate dependent nonlocal dynamic boundary condition. The kinetic rate $1/L$,
with $L\in[0,+\infty)$, distinguishes different types of bulk-surface
interactions. When $L\in[0,+\infty)$, for a general class of singular
potentials including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we
establish the existence of a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ in a suitable
complete metric space. Moreover, we verify that the global attractor
$\mathcal{A}_m^0$ is stable with respect to perturbations $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ for
small $L>0$. For the case $L\in(0,+\infty)$, based on the strict separation
property of solutions, we prove the existence of exponential attractors through
a short trajectory type technique, which also yields that the global attractor
has finite fractal dimension. Finally, when $L\in(0,+\infty)$, by usage of a
generalized {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality and an Alikakos-Moser type
iteration, we show that every global weak solution converges to a single
equilibrium in $\mathcal{L}^\infty$ as time tends to infinity.

TL;DR: Existence proof of time quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for 3D gravity water waves in finite depth, with arbitrary propagation speeds, using KAM theory for autonomous dispersive quasi-linear PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traveling waves are fundamental building blocks for understanding long-time dynamics in fluid mechanics, which remains an open problem. The search extends from Stokes' 1847 computations to modern challenges in higher-dimensional PDEs.

Method: KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) theory applied to autonomous, dispersive, quasi-linear Partial Differential Equations in dimension greater than one. The approach handles small divisors problems with complicated resonance geometry.

Result: First KAM result for autonomous dispersive quasi-linear PDEs in dimension >1. Global time quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions exist that do not reduce to stationary solutions in any moving reference frame.

Conclusion: This provides the first example of global solutions for 3D water waves on compact domains that are genuinely time-dependent (not steady in any moving frame), representing a breakthrough in handling small divisors problems for higher-dimensional quasi-linear PDEs.

Abstract: Starting with the pioneering computations of Stokes in 1847, the search of
traveling waves in fluid mechanics has always been a fundamental topic, since
they can be seen as building blocks to determine the long time dynamics (which
is a widely open problem). In this paper we prove the existence of time
quasi-periodic traveling wave solutions for three-dimensional pure gravity
water waves in finite depth, on flat tori, with an arbitrary number of speeds
of propagation. These solutions are global in time, they do not reduce to
stationary solutions in any moving reference frame and they are approximately
given by finite sums of Stokes waves traveling with rationally independent
speeds of propagation. This is a very hard small divisors problem for Partial
Differential Equations due to the fact that one deals with a dispersive
quasi-linear PDE in higher dimension with a very complicated geometry of the
resonances. Our result is the first KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) result for an
autonomous, dispersive, quasi-linear PDE in dimension greater than one and it
is the first example of global solutions, which do not reduce to steady ones in
any moving reference frame, for 3D water waves equations on compact domains.

*Martin Ulmer*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Equivalence between Dirichlet and Regularity problems for elliptic operators under L1-Carleson condition on |∂tA|


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a full reverse direction from solvability of adjoint Dirichlet problem to Regularity problem solvability, improving upon Shen's partial result

Method: Study elliptic operators on upper half space, assume L1-Carleson condition on |∂tA|, prove equivalence between (D)*p' and (R)p solvability

Result: Full reverse direction holds under L1-Carleson condition, extending class of operators with solvable Lp Regularity problem to those satisfying mixed L1-L∞ condition

Conclusion: Equivalence between Dirichlet and Regularity problems established under weaker condition, expanding applicability to broader class of elliptic operators

Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper
half space. It is known that solvability of the Regularity problem in
$\dot{W}^{1,p}$ implies solvability of the adjoint Dirichlet problem in
$L^{p'}$. Previously, Shen (2007) established a partial reverse result. In our
work, we show that if we assume an $L^1$-Carleson condition on only
$|\partial_t A|$ the full reverse direction holds. As a result, we obtain
equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet problem $(D)^*_{p'}$ and the
Regularity problem $(R)_p$ under this condition.
  As a further consequence, we can extend the class of operators for which the
$L^p$ Regularity problem is solvable by operators satisfying the mixed
$L^1-L^\infty$ condition. Additionally in the case of the upper half plane,
this class includes operators satisfying this $L^1$-Carleson condition on
$|\partial_t A|$.

Motivation: To develop a rigorous framework for proving existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear partial differential equations that possess both space and non-space group symmetries, addressing the challenge of validating such solutions mathematically.

Method: Construct natural Hilbert space H^l_G containing only functions with G-symmetry. Use Newton-Kantorovich approach based on approximate inverse around approximate solution u_0. Combine meticulous analysis with computer-assisted techniques to compute explicit bounds for validation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the methodology on 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving existence of various dihedral localized patterns. The approach works for different symmetry group properties.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous and general approach for proving existence of localized solutions in semi-linear PDEs with group symmetries, validated through computer-assisted proofs and applicable to various symmetry properties.

Abstract: In this article, we extend the framework developed previously to allow for
rigorous proofs of existence of smooth, localized solutions in semi-linear
partial differential equations possessing both space and non-space group
symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on the Swift-Hohenberg model. In
particular, for a given symmetry group $\mathcal{G}$, we construct a natural
Hilbert space $H^l_{\mathcal{G}}$ containing only functions with
$\mathcal{G}$-symmetry. In this space, products and differential operators are
well-defined allowing for the study of autonomous semi-linear PDEs. Depending
on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach
based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate
solution, $u_0$. More specifically, combining a meticulous analysis and
computer-assisted techniques, the Newton-Kantorovich approach is validated
thanks to the computation of some explicit bounds. The strategy for
constructing $u_0$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these
bounds will depend on the properties of $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate the
methodology on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of various
dihedral localized patterns. The algorithmic details to perform the
computer-assisted proofs can be found on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ferronematic materials have potential applications in display technologies, sensors, and microfluidics devices, requiring better understanding of their complex interactions between liquid crystal molecules and magnetic particles under external magnetic fields.

Method: Variational approach using a free energy functional combining Landau-de Gennes nematic energy density and micromagnetics theory, including stray field energy approximation. Proved existence and uniqueness of energy minimizers, then numerically solved gradient flow equations.

Result: Proved existence of energy minimizer and uniqueness in certain parameter regimes. Numerical computations showed that stray field influences localization of interior nematic defects and magnetic vortices.

Conclusion: The proposed ferronematic energy model successfully captures the complex interactions and provides both theoretical guarantees (existence/uniqueness) and practical insights into defect localization through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Ferronematic materials are colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles in
liquid crystals. They are complex materials with potential applications in
display technologies, sensors, microfluidics devices, etc. We consider a model
for ferronematics in a 2D domain with a variational approach. The proposed free
energy of the ferronematic system depends on the Landau-de Gennes (LdG) order
parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ and the magnetization $\mathbf{M}$, and incorporates the
complex interaction between the liquid crystal molecules and the magnetic
particles in the presence of an external magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_{ext}$. The
energy functional combines the Landau-de Gennes nematic energy density and
energy densities from the theory of micromagnetics including (an approximation
of) the stray field energy and energetic contributions from an external
magnetic field. For the proposed ferronematic energy, we first prove the
existence of an energy minimizer and then the uniqueness of the minimizer in
certain parameter regimes. Secondly, we numerically compute stable ferronematic
equilibria by solving the gradient flow equations associated with the proposed
ferronematic energy. The numerical results show that the stray field influences
the localization of the interior nematic defects and magnetic vortices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate self-organization phenomena and complex system dynamics in Wolfram cellular automata, particularly focusing on asymptotic density relationships and pattern generation mechanisms.

Method: Employed numerical simulations and computational methods with both supervised and unsupervised learning (including principal component analysis and autoencoders) to analyze configurations and identify patterns across different Wolfram rules.

Result: Revealed relationships between asymptotic density and initial density, showed that supervised learning effectively identifies configurations, and demonstrated that unsupervised methods can cluster different Wolfram rules into distinct groups matching simulated density outputs.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods are effective tools for analyzing and classifying Wolfram cellular automata patterns, providing insights into their dynamical behavior and density relationships across different rules and initial conditions.

Abstract: The local rules of Wolfram cellular automata with one-dimensional three-cell
neighborhoods are represented by eight-bit binary that encode deterministic
update rules. These automata are widely utilized to investigate
self-organization phenomena and the dynamics of complex systems. In this work,
we employ numerical simulations and computational methods to investigate the
asymptotic density and dynamical evolution mechanisms in Wolfram automata. We
apply both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to identify the
configurations associated with different Wolfram rules. Furthermore, we explore
alternative initial conditions under which certain Wolfram rules generate
similar fractal patterns over time, even when starting from a single active
site. Our results reveal the relationship between the asymptotic density and
the initial density of selected rules. The supervised learning methods
effectively identify the configurations of various Wolfram rules, while
unsupervised methods like principal component analysis and autoencoders can
approximately cluster configurations of different Wolfram rules into distinct
groups, yielding results that align well with simulated density outputs.

TL;DR: Physics-embedded ML force fields using self-adaptive bond-length sampling and intermolecular correction strategies to prevent structural collapse and improve property prediction accuracy in organic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of ML force fields in organic systems, including structural collapse during simulation and significant deviations in macroscopic property predictions.

Method: Two strategies: 1) Physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling method requiring minimal single-molecule data for stable simulations; 2) Top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on physical equations using small simulation data and GPU optimization.

Result: Achieved long-timescale stable simulations across molecular systems (engineering fluids, polypeptides, pharmaceuticals) and significantly reduced errors in density and viscosity for systems like ethylene carbonate, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate.

Conclusion: Physics-embedded approaches enhance robustness and generalizability of ML force fields, providing a scalable pathway for integrating physical insights into machine learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields possess unprecedented potential in achieving
both accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. Nevertheless, their
application in organic systems is often hindered by structural collapse during
simulation and significant deviations in the prediction of macroscopic
properties. Here, two physics-embedded strategies are introduced to overcome
these limitations. First, a physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling
method achieves long-timescale stable simulations by requiring only several
tens of single-molecule data sets, and has been validated across molecular
systems, including engineering fluids, polypeptides, and pharmaceuticals.
Second, a top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on a physical
equation is introduced. This strategy requires only a small amount of
simulation data and completes the optimization of tunable parameters within a

TL;DR: Small-scale dynamos show linear magnetic energy growth in subsonic turbulence and quadratic growth in supersonic turbulence, with universal efficiency of ~1/100 and duration of ~20 turnover times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the theoretical prediction of nonlinear magnetic energy growth scaling across different turbulent flow regimes (subsonic to supersonic) in small-scale dynamos.

Method: Conducted a large ensemble of small-scale dynamo simulations spanning subsonic to supersonic turbulence regimes.

Result: Found linear growth (p_nl = 1) in subsonic flows and quadratic growth (p_nl = 2) in supersonic flows, with consistent dynamo efficiency of ~1/100 and duration of Δt ≈ 20t_0 across all cases.

Conclusion: Established universal timescales and efficiencies of nonlinear small-scale dynamos that apply across astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.

Abstract: Small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas.
Theory predicts nonlinear magnetic energy growth $E_\mathrm{mag} \propto
t^{p_\mathrm{nl}}$, but this scaling has not been tested across flow regimes.
Using a large ensemble of SSD simulations spanning sub- to supersonic
turbulence, we find linear growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 1$) in subsonic flows and
quadratic growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 2$) in supersonic flows. In all cases, we
find a dynamo efficiency of $\sim 1/100$ and a duration $\Delta t \approx
20\,t_0$, with $t_0$ the turnover time, establishing the universal timescales
and efficiencies of the nonlinear SSD across astrophysical and laboratory
plasmas.

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: A new magnetodynamic effect called translational-rotational conversion (TRC) enables energy exchange between translational and rotational motion in a conducting cylinder moving through a helical magnetic field, without requiring electrical contact with external circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a theory for converting translational motion into angular rotation in conducting objects within helical magnetic fields, exploring connections to free electron lasers and the inverse Faraday effect while eliminating the need for external electrical circuits.

Method: The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers for fast-moving well-conducting objects, using nonlinear pendulum equations to describe system dynamics, including phase lock modes.

Result: Demonstrated effective conversion of translational motion into angular rotation, revealed connections to helical electron trajectories in FELs and IFE, and showed applicability to magnetohydrodynamic flows in helical magnetic fields.

Conclusion: TRC represents a novel magnetodynamic effect with significant practical advantages due to its contact-free operation, making it attractive for various applications in energy conversion and motion control systems.

Abstract: A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange
between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical
magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting
the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the
system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A
connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of
electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday
effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated
with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor
has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially
attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a
magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The
theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which
corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this
scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum
equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In
the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be
implemented.

TL;DR: X-ray Thomson scattering measurements of warm dense aluminum show TDDFT accurately predicts plasmon dispersion, while RPA and LFC models overestimate frequencies, establishing TDDFT as reliable for warm dense matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly test competing theories of electron dynamics in warm dense matter conditions and determine which theoretical approach best describes electronic correlations under extreme conditions.

Method: Used X-ray Thomson scattering at European XFEL's HED-HiBEF instrument with DiPOLE-100X drive laser to probe plasmon dispersion across momentum transfers k = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom⁻¹ in warm dense aluminium at densities 3.75-4.5 g/cm³ and temperature ~0.6 eV.

Result: TDDFT reproduced both plasmon energies and spectral shapes across full k range, while RPA and static LFC models systematically overestimated plasmon frequency. Measurements show simple uniform electron gas models fail in warm dense matter.

Conclusion: TDDFT is established as a reliable approach for electronic correlations in warm dense matter regime, accounting for electron localization around ions and loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder.

Abstract: We report X-ray Thomson scattering measurements of warm dense aluminium at
densities 3.75-4.5 g/cm$^3$ and a temperature of approximately 0.6 eV,
performed at the HED-HiBEF instrument of the European XFEL using the
DiPOLE-100X drive laser. By probing plasmon dispersion across momentum
transfers $k$ = 0.99-2.57 Angstrom$^{-1}$ with high statistical fidelity, we
directly test competing theories of electron dynamics under extreme conditions.
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) reproduces both the observed
plasmon energies and spectral shapes across the full $k$ range, whereas the
random phase approximation (RPA) and static local-field-correction (LFC) models
systematically overestimate the plasmon frequency, even for aluminium (a
canonical uniform electron gas metal). Considering electron localisation around
ions and the loss of crystalline symmetry due to liquid-state disorder, our
measurements provide direct evidence that simple uniform electron gas models
fail in warm dense matter and establish TDDFT as a reliable approach for
electronic correlations in this regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the power coupled to plasma from resonance cone emission and understand its behavior across different collisionality regimes, particularly in the challenging cold collisionless limit.

Method: Analytical calculation of power for cylindrical source emitting propagative slow waves (resonance cones) in low density magnetized plasmas where Stix parameters S and P have different signs.

Result: The coupled power remains finite in the cold collisionless limit, even though the radiofrequency electric field and associated power absorption density are singular.

Conclusion: This work provides the first calculation of power coupling for any collisionality and establishes the main parameter dependencies, resolving the apparent paradox of finite power despite singular field behavior.

Abstract: We consider the power coupled to the plasma from a cylindrical source
emitting resonance cones, propagative slow waves which exist in low density
magnetized plasmas when the signs of the Stix parameters S and P differ. In
this work, we calculate this power for the first time for any collisionality,
and show that it remains finite in the cold collisionless limit, even as the
radiofrequency electric field itself, and the associated power absorption
density, is singular. We give the main parameter dependencies of the coupled
power.

TL;DR: Analysis of turbulent solutions to stochastic transport/continuity equations with Gaussian white-in-time velocity fields, covering anomalous dissipation, regularity gain, and Richardson's law analog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously establish properties of turbulent solutions constructed by Le Jan and Raimond, particularly focusing on anomalous energy dissipation, self-regularization effects, and particle dispersion behavior in stochastic transport equations.

Method: Uses Gaussian white-in-time velocity fields with α-Hölder spatial regularity. Analyzes degenerate parabolic PDE for two-point correlation functions. Derives Duchon-Robert-type formulas for anomalous dissipation. Studies particle trajectories and their stochastic properties.

Result: Proves anomalous dissipation of mean energy for L² data, immediate regularity gain into fractional Sobolev spaces, and average squared dispersion growing as t¹/(¹-α) for Dirac delta initial conditions (Richardson's law analog).

Conclusion: The work establishes fundamental properties of turbulent stochastic transport equations, connecting self-regularization effects with energy flux limits in turbulent cascade, and rigorously validates Richardson's dispersion law in this stochastic framework.

Abstract: In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of "turbulent"
solutions to the stochastic transport and the stochastic continuity equations
constructed by Le Jan and Raimond in [Ann. Probab. 30(2): 826-873, 2002]. The
advecting velocity field, not necessarily incompressible, is Gaussian and
white-in-time, space-homogeneous and isotropic, with $\alpha$-H\"older
regularity in space, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We cover the full range of
compressibility ratios giving spontaneous stochasticity of particle
trajectories. For the stochastic transport equation, we prove that generic
$L^2_x$ data experience anomalous dissipation of the mean energy, and study
basic properties of the resulting anomalous dissipation measure. Moreover, we
show that starting from such irregular data, the solution immediately gains
regularity and enters into a fractional Sobolev space $H^{1-\alpha-}_x$. The
proof of the latter is obtained as a consequence of a new sharp regularity
result for the degenerate parabolic PDE satisfied by the associated two-point
self-correlation function, which is of independent interest. In the
incompressible case, a Duchon-Robert-type formula for the anomalous dissipation
measure is derived, making a precise connection between this self-regularizing
effect and a limit on the flux of energy in the turbulent cascade. Finally, for
the stochastic continuity equation, we prove that solutions starting from a
Dirac delta initial condition undergo an average squared dispersion growing
with respect to time as $t^{1/(1-\alpha)}$, rigorously establishing the
analogue of Richardson's law of particle separations in fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: This approach opens new bio-inspired pathways for scalable and robust mechanical metamaterial design, overcoming key limitations of traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: Understanding how living organisms spontaneously develop complex functional
structures inspires innovative approaches in engineering design. Here, we
introduce a decentralized generative model based on morphogenesis to
autonomously grow mechanical structures with controlled tensorial properties.
By adapting Turing's reaction-diffusion concept through anisotropic diffusion,
our approach enables the local emergence of microstructures exhibiting tailored
stiffness and anisotropy, achieving target orthotropic tensors without adjoint
or topology optimization loops. The synthesis of these structures relies on a
database linking morphogenetic parameters to effective elastic tensors obtained
through homogenization techniques. We experimentally demonstrate this concept

independently control local anisotropy and rigidity, and effectively conceal
structural defects from mechanical fields. This approach not only addresses key
limitations of traditional topology optimization methods but also opens new
bio-inspired pathways for scalable and robust mechanical metamaterial design.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Nonlocal nonlinearity in optical media delays branching points and broadens flow structures, counteracting self-focusing effects and restoring branched flow towards linear conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research showed self-focusing accelerates optical branched flow formation, but the impact of nonlocal nonlinear response on branched flow remains unexplored.

Method: Developed a semi-analytical formula to study how nonlocality range affects branched flow in randomly correlated media with nonlinear response.

Result: Increasing nonlocality range delays first branching point to greater distances and broadens flow structures, screening self-focusing effects.

Conclusion: Nonlocality counteracts self-focusing in optical branched flow, ultimately restoring the system towards linear propagation conditions through its averaging effect.

Abstract: When light propagates through a randomly correlated, slowly varying medium,
it generates optical branched flow. Previous studies have demonstrated that the
self-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the
first branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this
study, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear
response on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the
range of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater
distance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores
the branched flow to its linear condition. We have developed a semi-analytical
formula and confirmed the screening of the self-focusing effect on branching
flow by nonlocality.

TL;DR: Study of spherical metrics on flat tori with prescribed conical singularities at specific points with given cone angles, establishing existence criteria based on Green function critical points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the existence and uniqueness conditions for families of spherical metrics on flat tori with specific conical singularity configurations, particularly relating their existence to the geometry of the torus through Green function properties.

Method: Mathematical analysis of spherical metrics on flat tori $E_{\tau} = \mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$, studying blow-up behavior at prescribed conical singularities with cone angles 6π at 0 and 4π at ±p, and establishing connections with Green function critical points.

Result: Proved that existence of unique even families of spherical metrics is determined by torus geometry: such families exist if and only if the Green function G(z;τ) has nontrivial critical points ±a, with p = a. Also established explicit transformation to single conical singularity case and proved rigidity for rhombic tori.

Conclusion: The geometry of the flat torus, specifically the existence of critical points of the Green function, completely determines the existence of spherical metrics with prescribed conical singularities, with explicit connections to simpler cases and special results for rhombic tori.

Abstract: We study families of spherical metrics on the flat torus $E_{\tau}$ $=$
$\mathbb{C}/\Lambda_{\tau}$ with blow-up behavior at prescribed conical
singularities at $0$ and $\pm p$, where the cone angle at $0$ is $6\pi$, and at
$\pm p$ is $4\pi$. We prove that the existence of such a necessarily unique,
even family of spherical metrics is completely determined by the geometry of
the torus: such a family exists if and only if\textbf{ }the Green function
$G(z;\tau)$ admits a pair of nontrivial critical points $\pm a$. In this case,
the cone point $p$ must equal $a$, and the corresponding monodromy data is
$\left( 2r,2s\right) $, where $a=r+s\tau.$
  An explicit transformation relating this family to the one with a single
conical singularity of angle $6\pi$ at the origin is established in Theorem
1.4. A rigidity result for rhombic tori is proved in Theorem 1.5.

*Marcelo A. Pires,Constantino Tsallis,Evaldo M. F. Curado*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: A new nonlinear dynamics model called α-Gauss-Logistic map is introduced, combining logistic and α-Gauss maps. The system shows rich behavior with period-doubling cascades for α<1, abrupt chaos onset for 1≤α<2, and no regular behavior for α≥2. Analytical solutions exist for α=1, with golden ratio Φ marking gap disappearance threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and analyze a novel nonlinear dynamical system that combines features of logistic and α-Gauss maps, exploring how the interplay between these two components creates diverse chaotic behaviors and transitions depending on parameter values.

Method: Constructed a new map by composing logistic map f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t) with α-Gauss map: x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-α} - floor(f_L(x_t)x_t^{-α}). Analyzed system behavior through numerical simulations and analytical methods including Lyapunov exponent calculation and Perron-Frobenius equation for invariant density.

Result: The system exhibits three distinct regimes: multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos with stability windows (α<1), abrupt chaos onset without prior bifurcations (1≤α<2), and absence of regular behavior (α≥2). For α=1, analytical solutions show chaotic regimes with gaps/gapless behavior, with golden ratio Φ as threshold. At chaos edge, invariant density approaches q-Gaussian with q=2 (Cauchy distribution).

Conclusion: The α-Gauss-Logistic map demonstrates rich nonlinear dynamics controlled by just two parameters, revealing diverse routes to chaos including both gradual and abrupt transitions. The special case α=1 provides exact analytical solutions, while the golden ratio emerges as a fundamental threshold in the regime diagram, highlighting deep mathematical connections in nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics
constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our
model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor
f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the
logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our
investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters,
$r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha < 1$, the system exhibits multiple
period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased,
interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast,
for $1 \leq \alpha < 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any
prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without
stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The
special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a
closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact
uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes
for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio
$\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the
regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition
regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which
corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.

TL;DR: Three novel 3D pentagraphene allotropes (α, β, γ) were created from 2D pentagraphene via biaxial strain and compression, showing thermodynamic stability, semiconducting behavior with 0.91-2.67 eV band gaps, anisotropic mechanical properties, and promising optical characteristics for UV-blocking applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carbon-based materials offer exceptional structural diversity and wide applications. The recent discovery of 2D pentagraphene motivated the exploration of novel 3D carbon allotropes to expand the family of carbon materials with potentially unique properties.

Method: Engineered three 3D pentagraphene allotropes through biaxial strain and controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Conducted comprehensive stability analyses including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) to confirm thermodynamic stability at room and high temperatures.

Result: All three structures (3D-PG-α, β, γ) are thermodynamically stable, with 3D-PG-α being most stable (0.5 eV/atom lower cohesive energy than γ). All exhibit semiconducting behavior with indirect band gaps from 0.91-2.67 eV, show significant mechanical anisotropy with higher stiffness in xy-plane, and demonstrate strong optical absorption across wide range with visible region activity.

Conclusion: The novel 3D pentagraphene allotropes are stable semiconducting materials with anisotropic mechanical and optical properties. Their absorption in visible region and refractive/reflectivity characteristics suggest potential applications in ultraviolet-blocking devices, expanding the family of functional carbon-based materials.

Abstract: Carbon-based materials have attracted great attention due to their
exceptional structural diversity and wide-ranging applications. Recently, a new
two-dimensional carbon allotrope, named pentagraphene (PG), was proposed. In
this study, we proposed three novel three-dimensional (3D) PG allotropes, named
3D-PG-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, and -$\gamma$, engineered through biaxial strain and
controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Comprehensive stability analyses,
including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
(AIMD), confirm their thermodynamic stability under room and high-temperature
conditions. 3D-PG-$\alpha$ is the most stable, exhibiting a cohesive energy 0.5
eV/atom lower than the least stable structure, 3D-PG-$\gamma$. Electronic
property characterization reveals semiconducting behavior for all structures,
with indirect electronic band gaps ranging from 0.91 to 2.67 eV. The analyses
of the mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy, with higher
stiffness along the in-plane ($xy$-plane) direction. Optical properties
highlight strong absorption along a wide range and a pronounced anisotropic
response. Additionally, the absorption spectra exhibit activity in the visible
region, and the refractive index and reflectivity indicate potential use in
ultraviolet-blocking devices.

TL;DR: NH2 and NH3 adsorption on defective MoS2/MoSe2 monolayers induces magnetism through localized magnetic moments, with MoSe2 showing 2.0 μB moment from NH3 dissociation, while W-based dichalcogenides remain non-magnetic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how molecular adsorption (NH2 and NH3) combined with defects can tune magnetic properties in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for potential spintronic applications.

Method: Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study mono- and di-vacancies and molecular adsorption effects on magnetic behavior in MoS2 and MoSe2 monolayers.

Result: Pristine chalcogen vacancies don't generate magnetism, but NH2/NH3 adsorption creates localized magnetic moments. MoSe2 shows 2.0 μB moment from NH3 dissociation. W-based dichalcogenides remain non-magnetic under same conditions.

Conclusion: Molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering is a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential for spintronic and sensing applications.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted
considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and
spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and
molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using
first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$)
and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide
(MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory
(DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the
local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying
magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not
generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates
localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs
for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same
side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests
performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no
magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings
demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a
practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance
for spintronic and sensing applications.

TL;DR: LLMs can generate scientifically appropriate code for solving ODEs by leveraging numerical algorithms instead of directly learning solutions, achieving high accuracy with proper prompting and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scientific machine learning approaches struggle with accuracy and robustness when predicting solutions directly. This work explores using LLMs to write code that utilizes established numerical algorithms, shifting the focus from learning functions to making domain-aware numerical choices.

Method: Introduces two datasets: a diagnostic set with misleading problems requiring algebraic simplification, and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. Evaluates LLMs on executability and numerical validity using guided prompting, domain knowledge, and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: With sufficient context and guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on both executability and numerical validity. Open-source systems perform strongly without fine-tuning, while older/smaller models benefit from fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Careful prompting and fine-tuning can create specialized LLM agents capable of reliably solving simple ODE problems by generating scientifically appropriate code that leverages numerical algorithms.

Abstract: Recent work in scientific machine learning aims to tackle scientific tasks
directly by predicting target values with neural networks (e.g.,
physics-informed neural networks, neural ODEs, neural operators, etc.), but
attaining high accuracy and robustness has been challenging. We explore an
alternative view: use LLMs to write code that leverages decades of numerical
algorithms. This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making
domain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents
that, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is
scientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),
and enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this
kind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce
two new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial "misleading" problems;
and a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set
contains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that
require algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the
large-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-
and closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided
prompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus
fine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical
validity against reference solutions. We find that with sufficient context and
guided prompts, newer instruction-following models achieve high accuracy on
both criteria. In many cases, recent open-source systems perform strongly
without fine-tuning, while older or smaller models still benefit from
fine-tuning. Overall, our preliminary results indicate that careful prompting
and fine-tuning can yield a specialized LLM agent capable of reliably solving
simple ODE problems.

*Antoine Orioua,Philipp Krah,Julian Koellermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IDEA is an autoencoder that estimates intrinsic dimension of datasets on linear/nonlinear manifolds and reconstructs data using re-weighted double CancelOut layers and projected reconstruction loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that can accurately estimate the intrinsic dimension of complex datasets while maintaining reconstruction capability, addressing limitations of existing intrinsic dimension estimators.

Method: Uses autoencoder architecture with re-weighted double CancelOut layers and introduces projected reconstruction loss term that assesses reconstruction quality under removal of latent dimensions.

Result: Shows good accuracy and high versatility on theoretical benchmarks, successfully estimates intrinsic dimension and reconstructs complex fluid flow simulation data.

Conclusion: IDEA provides an effective approach for intrinsic dimension estimation with reconstruction capabilities, demonstrating robustness across theoretical benchmarks and real-world scientific simulation data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA),
which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets
whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating
the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset
after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured
using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the
introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of
the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the
removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of
IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These
experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its
performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The
benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach.
Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution
of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a
pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal
direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the
dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by
working directly within the projection space identified by the network.

*Benjamin David Shaffer,Brooks Kinch,Joseph Klobusicky,M. Ani Hsieh,Nathaniel Trask*

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using structure-preserving digital twins with conditional neural Whitney forms for adaptive source localization in hydrodynamic-transport systems, combining FEEC guarantees with transformer-based operator learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a real-time source localization system that preserves physical constraints and adapts to streaming sensor data while maintaining numerical stability and conservation properties.

Method: Uses conditional neural Whitney forms (CNWF) coupling finite element exterior calculus with transformer-based operator learning, employs conditional attention mechanism for basis identification, and alternates between digital twin evaluation and Lloyd's algorithm for sensor placement.

Result: The framework preserves discrete conservation, adapts in real-time to sensor data, demonstrates recovery of point sources under continuity assumptions, and shows improved accuracy compared to physics-agnostic transformer architectures in complex geometries.

Conclusion: Structure preservation through CNWF provides an effective inductive bias for source identification, yielding physically realizable mappings from sensor data to source fields while maintaining simulation stability and consistency.

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in
which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled
hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data
assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms
(CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus
(FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves
discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It
employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form
basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible
with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model
retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation,
yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the
source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating
the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with
analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage
functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within
an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under
continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient
condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic
transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when
physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation
provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.

### [46] [Deep Neural Networks can eliminate Spiral-wave Turbulence in Cardiac Tissue Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09806)
*Vasanth Kumar Babu,Rahul Pandit*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: A deep-neural-network U-Net-based method is developed to efficiently control spiral-wave turbulence in cardiac tissue models, which are mathematical counterparts of ventricular arrhythmias that cause sudden cardiac death.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ventricular arrhythmias like VT and VF are leading causes of sudden cardiac death, and eliminating them is critically important. Numerical studies using mathematical models allow exploration of spiral-wave turbulence and development of low-amplitude defibrillation methods.

Method: Uses U-Net deep neural network trained on spiral-turbulence patterns from TP06 model to predict sodium current lines. Applies control currents near predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently, with amplitudes automatically adjusted based on correlation length.

Result: The method shows that lower correlation length for spiral-turbulence patterns makes them easier to eliminate. The U-Net-aided elimination of spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.

Conclusion: The developed U-Net-based approach provides an efficient and superior method for controlling spiral-wave turbulence in cardiac tissue models, offering potential advancements in low-amplitude defibrillation techniques for treating ventricular arrhythmias.

Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular
fibrillation (VF), precipitate sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is the leading
cause of mortality in the industrialised world. Thus, the elimination of VT and
VF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally,
theoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use
partial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions
with spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical
counterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models
of cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such
spiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of
low-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate
spiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method
for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac
tissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the
ionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the
correlation length {\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to
eliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We
then use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to
predict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track
the propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of
the predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The
amplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small
when {\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of
spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.

TL;DR: Numerical simulation of merging supermassive binary black holes shows thermal photon power comes from strong shocks rather than disk turbulence, with photon and jet outputs closely correlated in time and showing distinct lightcurve patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic jets, but their detailed emission mechanisms need investigation.

Method: 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity simulation covering late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of equal-mass black holes with aligned spins parallel to orbital angular momentum.

Result: Thermal photon power during merger phases comes from strong shocks rather than turbulence dissipation. Photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, diminishing gradually pre-merger but jumping sharply at merger to a noisy plateau.

Conclusion: The distinct lightcurve pattern should aid identification of supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.

Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas,
merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong
multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal
gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets.
Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger,
and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the
same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular
momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during
the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong
shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured
accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find
that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in
time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated
in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but
jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should
aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without
accompanying gravitational wave detections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains.

Method: Establish boundedness of H∞-calculus for Dirichlet Laplacian on angular domains using mixed weights based on distance to boundary and distance to tip.

Result: Proved bounded H∞-calculus and obtained maximal Lp-regularity for Poisson equation in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.

Conclusion: Successfully established functional calculus results for Dirichlet Laplacian on non-smooth domains with mixed weights, enabling applications to SPDEs and degenerate parabolic equations.

Abstract: We establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet
Laplacian on angular domains in $\R^2$ and corresponding wedges on $L^p$-spaces
with mixed weights. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary
and the distance to the tip of the underlying domain. Our main motivation comes
from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated
degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains. As a
consequence of our analysis, we also obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the
Poisson equation on angular domains in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.

TL;DR: Extends transfer operator theory to McKean-Vlasov equations, enabling computation of spectral properties to identify slow spatiotemporal patterns and metastable sets using extended dynamic mode decomposition and Galerkin projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-field SDEs (McKean-Vlasov equations) describe limiting behavior of symmetric interacting particle systems across various fields, but global dynamical information requires transfer operator analysis not previously available for these systems.

Method: Extends transfer operator theory to McKean-Vlasov equations, applies extended dynamic mode decomposition and Galerkin projection methodology to compute finite-dimensional approximations of Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators.

Result: Enables computation of spectral properties for McKean-Vlasov systems, allowing identification of slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns and detection of metastable sets, demonstrated on Cormier model, Kuramoto model, and 3D Kuramoto generalization.

Conclusion: Successfully extends transfer operator framework to mean-field stochastic systems, providing powerful analytical tools for understanding complex dynamical behavior in symmetric interacting particle systems across multiple application domains.

Abstract: Mean-field stochastic differential equations, also called McKean--Vlasov
equations, are the limiting equations of interacting particle systems with
fully symmetric interaction potential. Such systems play an important role in a
variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics.
Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be
obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer
operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In
this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and
show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection
methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these
operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify
slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The
results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and
benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a
three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.

TL;DR: Implementation of a contact line pinning model in SPH method for simulating capillary dynamics with pinned droplets on inhomogeneous substrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eulerian multi-phase flow solvers cannot directly implement pinning of three-phase contact lines, which is crucial for studying capillary flow phenomena involving wetting of inhomogeneous substrates.

Method: Developed a pinning model for continuum surface force scheme in an updated Lagrangian meshless flow solver based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), assuming free surface for liquid-gas interface.

Result: Validated the model against capillary dynamics experiments with pinned three-phase contact lines on both fixed and dynamic substrates, demonstrating robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: The SPH-based pinning model successfully enables simulation of capillary dynamics with pinned contact lines, providing valuable insights for wetting phenomena on inhomogeneous substrates.

Abstract: In several capillary dynamics experiments, the liquid domain is confined by
pinning the three-phase contact line along a sharp edge or a discontinuity on
the substrate. Simulating the dynamics of pinned droplets can offer valuable
insights into capillary flow phenomena involving wetting of inhomogeneous
substrates. However, Eulerian multi-phase flow solvers are usually not able to
directly implement pinning of three-phase contact lines. We present the
implementation of a model for pinning the contact line of a liquid along an
arbitrary pinning curve on the substrate, in an updated Lagrangian, meshless
flow solver based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We
develop the pinning model for a continuum surface force scheme and assume a
free surface for the liquid-gas interface. We validate the model against
several capillary dynamics experiments involving pinned three phase contact
lines with fixed and dynamic substrates to demonstrate the robustness and
accuracy of the solver.
