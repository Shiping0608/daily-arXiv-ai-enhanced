Our\ninvestigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters,\n$r$ and $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha < 1$, the system exhibits multiple\nperiod-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased,\ninterspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast,\nfor $1 \\leq \\alpha < 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any\nprior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without\nstability windows. For $\\alpha \\geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The\nspecial case of $\\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a\nclosed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact\nuniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation.
