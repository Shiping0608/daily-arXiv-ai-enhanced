Accurate modeling requires an integrated\nnumerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase\ninteractions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously\ndeveloped fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase\nfield based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection\nis achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The\nnormal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to\nthe overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the\nCoulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by\nprojecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of\ncolliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of\nboth normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation,\navoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several\ntest cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed\nfrictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem\nshows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\\%$\nin the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed\ndisplacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass\nsystems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates\nstable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential\nforces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the\nproposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice\ninteraction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects."}

In this work, we propose a novel loss\nfunction for training UQ-VAEs, which includes, among other modifications, the\nremoval of a sample mean term from an already existing one. This modification\nimproves the accuracy of UQ-VAEs, as the original theoretical result relies on\nthe convergence of the sample mean to the expected value (a condition that, in\nhigh dimensional parameter spaces, requires a prohibitively large number of\nsamples due to the curse of dimensionality). Avoiding the computation of the\nsample mean significantly reduces the training time in high dimensional\nparameter spaces compared to previous literature results. Under this new\nformulation, we establish a new theoretical result for the approximation of the\nposterior mean and covariance for general mathematical problems. We validate\nthe effectiveness of UQ-VAEs through three benchmark numerical tests: a Poisson\ninverse problem, a non affine inverse problem and a 0D cardiocirculatory model,\nunder the two clinical scenarios of systemic hypertension and ventricular\nseptal defect. For the latter case, we perform forward uncertainty\nquantification."}

KBM critical pedestals\nare consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and\nspherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the\ncalculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on\na novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M.

Then conditional on a strict\ncomparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz\ninequality for the Schr\\\"odinger equations, we prove that there exist functions\nwhich extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence\nwhich converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined\nTomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key\ningredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use\nTao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the\nTomas-Stein range.
