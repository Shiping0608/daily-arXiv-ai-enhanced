Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying\nthe failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant\nerror-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical\nfailure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access\ncircuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more\ndifficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components\n(gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the\ncircuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6}\nregime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work\nby Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works\nstudied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is\ninsufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription\nof the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise\nmodel. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard\nMonte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime.

Runge-Kutta integration and total\nvariation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is\na trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The\ntrained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate\nfirst-order derivatives via automatic differentiation.

Supplementary information will be uploaded in a\n  forthcoming version of the manuscript", "summary": "Whether singularities can form in fluids remains a foundational unanswered\nquestion in mathematics. This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing\nequations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from\nsmooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily\nidentified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for\nkey open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases,\nwhere unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we\npresent the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable\nsingularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the\ninitial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are\nexceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite\nprecision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations\nimmediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we\npresent multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible\nporous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a\nsimple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of\ninstability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and\ntraining schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving\naccuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered\nsolutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine\nprecision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off\nerrors of the GPU hardware. This level of precision meets the requirements for\nrigorous mathematical validation via computer-assisted proofs. This work\nprovides a new playbook for exploring the complex landscape of nonlinear\npartial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling long-standing challenges in\nmathematical physics."}

This cooperative learning scheme is naturally\nparallelizable and improves robustness to noise as well as to sparse or\nheterogeneous data. Extensive numerical experiments on both static and\ntime-dependent problems demonstrate that HYCO outperforms classical\nphysics-based and data-driven methods, recovering accurate solutions and model\nparameters even under ill-posed conditions.
