### [1] [On the extension of a class of Hermite bivariate interpolation problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14359)
*Hakop Hakopian,Anush Khachatryan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Characterization of solvability sets for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems when sum of multiplicities is at most 2n+2, extending previous 2n+1 result


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of Hermite bivariate interpolation solvability beyond the previously established 2n+1 case, building on classical work by Severi (1921)

Method: Mathematical analysis and characterization of solvability conditions for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems in polynomial spaces of degree n

Result: Complete characterization of solvability sets when the sum of multiplicities is at most 2n+2, extending the previous 2n+1 result

Conclusion: This work successfully generalizes the interpolation theory framework, providing a more comprehensive understanding of solvability conditions for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems

Abstract: We characterize the sets of solvability for Hermite bivariate interpolation
problems when the sum of multiplicities is at most $2n + 2$, with $n$ the
degree of the polynomial space. This result extends an earlier theorem (2000)
by one of the authors concerning the case $2n+1$. The latter theorem, in turn,
can be regarded as a natural generalization of a classical theorem of Severi
(1921).

### [2] [Error analysis of a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element scheme for a diffuse-interface model of tumour growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14486)
*Agus L. Soenjaya,Ping Lin,Thanh Tran*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A structure-preserving finite element method for tumor growth modeling using Cahn-Hilliard and reaction-diffusion equations with SAV formulation, achieving linear, energy-stable, mass-preserving discretization with proven error estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a numerical method that preserves the dissipative energy structure of diffuse-interface tumor growth models while maintaining computational efficiency and mathematical rigor.

Method: Combines scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation with mixed finite elements for Cahn-Hilliard part and standard conforming elements for reaction-diffusion equation, using first-order Euler time-stepping.

Result: Method is linear, unconditionally energy-stable, mass-preserving, requires solving only linear systems per time step, with proven first-order time accuracy and optimal-order space accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully captures tumor growth phenomena while preserving mathematical structure and demonstrates robustness through numerical validation of theoretical convergence rates.

Abstract: We develop a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element method for a
diffuse-interface model of tumour growth. The system couples a Cahn--Hilliard
type equation with a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation for nutrient
concentration and admits a dissipative energy law at the continuous level. For
the discretisation, we employ a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation
together with a mixed finite element method for the Cahn--Hilliard part and
standard conforming finite elements for the reaction-diffusion equation in
space, combined with a first-order Euler time-stepping scheme. The resulting
method is linear, unconditionally energy-stable, mass-preserving, and inherits
a discrete energy dissipation law associated with the SAV-based approximate
energy functional, while requiring the solution of only linear systems at each
time step. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, we
derive rigorous error estimates in $L^2$, $H^1$, and $L^\infty$ norms,
establishing first-order accuracy in time and optimal-order accuracy in space.
A key step in this analysis is the proof of boundedness of the numerical
solutions in $L^\infty$. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical
convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness of the method in capturing
characteristic phenomena such as aggregation and chemotactic tumour growth.

### [3] [The extended horizontal linear complementarity problem: iterative methods and error analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14491)
*Shi-Liang Wu,Cui-Xia Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the long-standing gap in iterative methods and error analysis for the extended horizontal linear complementarity problem (EHLCP) since its 1977 introduction, proposing novel fixed-point formulation, iterative algorithms, and error bounds with numerical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EHLCP has remained without iterative methods or error analysis for decades due to its complex 'chain-like' structure with interdependent multiple unknowns, creating a significant research gap that needs addressing.

Method: The authors propose: (1) an equivalent fixed-point formulation using variable transformation with max-min function, (2) efficient iterative methods with convergence analysis, and (3) derivation of global error bounds and computable estimates.

Result: The paper demonstrates effectiveness through numerical examples from multicommodity market equilibrium and bilateral obstacle problems, showing practical applicability of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: This research successfully fills the decades-long gap in EHLCP analysis by providing the first iterative methods, convergence guarantees, and error bounds for this challenging problem class, validated through real-world applications.

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, since the extended horizontal linear
complementarity problem (EHLCP) was first introduced and studied by Kaneko in
1977, no iterative methods or error analysis have been developed for it due to
the interdependence of its multiple unknowns in a 'chain-like' structure. This
paper aims to address these gaps by:
  (1) proposing an equivalent fixed-point formulation of the EHLCP by using a
variable transformation technique with the max-min function;
  (2) developing efficient iterative methods for solving the EHLCP based on
this fixed-point form, along with their convergence analysis;
  (3) deriving global error bounds and computable estimates for the EHLCP.
  Several numerical examples from applications such as multicommodity market
equilibrium and bilateral obstacle problems are given to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods and bounds.

### [4] [The whys and hows of conditioning of DG plane wave Trefftz methods: a single element](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14500)
*Joseph Coyle,Nilima Nigam*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of conditioning issues in plane-wave Trefftz methods for Helmholtz equation, focusing on single disk-shaped elements and evaluating preconditioning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plane-wave Trefftz methods offer advantages over standard polynomial approaches but suffer from poor conditioning of system matrices, which needs to be addressed.

Method: Study mass and stiffness matrices on single disk-shaped elements, examine preconditioning strategies using conditioning analysis, GMRES residuals, and L^2-error impact.

Result: The paper analyzes how element size and geometry affect matrix conditioning and evaluates the effectiveness of different preconditioning approaches.

Conclusion: Understanding the conditioning properties of plane-wave Trefftz methods is crucial for developing effective preconditioning strategies to improve numerical performance.

Abstract: Plane-wave Trefftz methods (PWB) for the Helmholtz equation offer significant
advantages over standard discretization approaches whose implementation employs
more general polynomial basis functions. A disadvantage of these methods is the
poor conditioning of the system matrices. In the present paper, we carefully
examine the conditioning of the plane-wave discontinuous Galerkin method with
reference to a single element. The properties of the mass and stiffness
matrices depend on the size and geometry of the element. We study the mass and
system matrices arising from a PWB on a single disk-shaped element. We then
examine some preconditioning strategies, and present results showing their
behaviour with three different criteria: conditioning, the behaviour of GMRES
residuals, and impact on the $L^2$-error.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations using neural samplers via weak adversarial framework with plane-wave test functions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of density-based methods for solving Fokker-Planck equations and handle distributions without densities while ensuring probability conservation

Method: Represent solution distribution through neural pushforward map, use computationally efficient plane-wave test functions with explicitly computed derivatives in a weak adversarial framework

Result: The approach can handle distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability conservation

Conclusion: The proposed weak adversarial framework with neural samplers and plane-wave test functions provides an effective solution for Fokker-Planck equations, offering advantages over traditional density-based methods

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations by
learning neural samplers via a weak adversarial framework. We represent the
solution distribution through a neural pushforward map, bypassing the
limitations of density-based methods. A key innovation is our use of
computationally efficient plane-wave test functions, whose derivatives are
explicitly computed -- a treatment distinct from prior work. This approach
handles distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability
conservation.

### [6] [A Weighted Sampling Method for Inverse Medium Problem with Limited Aperture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14580)
*Fuqun Han,Kazufumi Ito*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new sampling method for inverse medium scattering problems with limited-aperture data that incorporates a weight function to improve reconstruction accuracy and stability compared to classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical sampling methods like MUSIC and linear sampling deteriorate severely under limited-aperture conditions, especially with noise, creating a need for improved methods that work with restricted measurement data.

Method: Proposes a sampling method based on the linear sampling framework that incorporates a specially designed weight function into the index function. The weight modifies the kernel to reproduce full-aperture behavior using limited data, localizing oscillations and improving system conditioning.

Result: Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D demonstrate the method achieves greater accuracy and robustness than existing sampling-type methods, particularly for noisy, limited-aperture data.

Conclusion: The proposed weighted sampling method effectively addresses the limitations of classical sampling methods for inverse medium scattering with limited-aperture data, providing more accurate and stable reconstructions with theoretical justification under the Born approximation.

Abstract: Inverse medium scattering problems arise in many applications, but in
practice, the measurement data are often restricted to a limited aperture by
physical or experimental constraints. Classical sampling methods, such as MUSIC
and the linear sampling method, are well understood for full-aperture data, yet
their performance deteriorates severely under limited-aperture conditions,
especially in the presence of noise. We propose a new sampling method tailored
to the inverse medium problem with limited-aperture data. The method is
motivated by the linear sampling framework and incorporates a weight function
into the index function. The weight is designed so that the modified kernel
reproduces the full-aperture behavior using only limited data, which both
localizes oscillations and improves the conditioning of the far-field system,
thereby yielding more accurate and stable reconstructions. We provide a
theoretical justification of the method under the Born approximation and an
efficient algorithm for computing the weight. Numerical experiments in two and
three dimensions demonstrate that the proposed method achieves greater accuracy
and robustness than existing sampling-type methods, particularly for noisy,
limited-aperture data.

### [7] [Decay of Chebyshev coefficients and error estimates of associated quadrature on shrinking intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14602)
*Krishna Yamanappa Poojara,Sabhrant Sachan,Ambuj Pandey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of Chebyshev coefficient decay and local approximations on shrinking intervals, providing error estimates for coefficient decay, approximation errors, and quadrature convergence across all Chebyshev polynomial families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill a gap in existing theory by providing a unified rigorous description of how approximation accuracy scales on shrinking intervals, offering practical guidance for high-order numerical methods on decomposed domains.

Method: Derived error estimates quantifying dependence on interval length for Chebyshev coefficient decay, approximation errors between continuous/discrete coefficients, and convergence of Chebyshev-based quadrature rules for all four Chebyshev polynomial families.

Result: Obtained theoretical error estimates that describe approximation accuracy scaling on shrinking intervals, with numerical experiments confirming the decay rates and error behavior in practice.

Conclusion: The results provide new theoretical insight and practical guidance for high-order numerical methods working on decomposed domains, filling an important gap in Chebyshev approximation theory for shrinking intervals.

Abstract: We analyze decay of Chebyshev coefficients and local Chebyshev approximations
for functions of finite regularity on finite intervals, focusing on the
framework where the interval length tends to zero while the number of
approximation nodes remains fixed. For all four families of Chebyshev
polynomials, we derive error estimates that quantify the dependence on the
interval length for (i) the decay of Chebyshev coefficients, (ii) the
approximation error between continuous and discrete Chebyshev coefficients, and
(iii) the convergence of Chebyshev-based quadrature rules. These results fill a
gap in the existing theory and provide a unified and rigorous description of
how approximation accuracy scales on shrinking intervals, offering new
theoretical insight and practical guidance for high-order numerical methods on
decomposed domains. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results,
confirming the decay rates and illustrating the error behavior in practice.

### [8] [Unconditional and optimal error analysis of two linearized finite difference schemes for the logarithmic Schrödinger equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14736)
*Tingchun Wang,Jingye Yan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Two linearized finite difference schemes for solving logarithmic Schrödinger equation without regularization, with improved error estimates and no time step restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient numerical methods for the logarithmic Schrödinger equation that overcome the singularity of the logarithmic nonlinearity and provide better error estimates without restrictive conditions.

Method: First-order and second-order backward difference formulas for temporal discretization combined with second-order central finite difference for spatial discretization, with novel techniques to handle the logarithmic singularity.

Result: Optimal l²-error estimates for first-order scheme, almost optimal for second-order scheme, plus discrete H¹ error estimates without grid ratio restrictions - significantly improving upon existing literature results.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes effectively handle the logarithmic singularity, provide superior convergence rates, eliminate time step restrictions, and offer comprehensive error analysis in both l² and H¹ norms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose two linearized finite difference schemes for
solving the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (LogSE) without the need for
regularization of the logarithmic term. These two schemes employ the
first-order and the second-order backward difference formula, respectively, for
temporal discretization of the LogSE, while using the second-order central
finite difference method for spatial discretization. We overcome the
singularity posed by the logarithmic nonlinearity $f(u)=u\ln|u|$ in
establishing optimal $l^{2}$-error estimates for the first-order scheme, and an
almost optimal $l^{2}$-error estimate for the second-order scheme. Compared to
the error estimates of the LogSE in the literature, our error bounds not only
greatly improve the convergence rate but also get rid of the time step
restriction. Furthermore, without enhancing the regularity of the exact
solution or imposing any requirements on the grid ratio, we establish error
estimates of the two proposed schemes in the discrete $H^{1}$ norm. However,
the existing results available in the literature either fail to provide $H^{1}$
error estimates or require certain restrictions on the grid ratio. Numerical
results are reported to confirm our error estimates and demonstrate rich
dynamics of the LogSE.

### [9] [The Bayesian SIAC filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14771)
*Jan Glaubitz,Tongtong Li,Jennifer Ryan,Roman Stuhlmacher*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Bayesian extension of SIAC filter for noise removal with uncertainty quantification and support for general data models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SIAC filter is limited to nodal data and deterministic point estimates without uncertainty quantification, restricting its applicability

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian extension with structure-exploiting algorithms for MAP estimation and MCMC sampling, focusing on linear data models with additive Gaussian noise

Result: Produces point estimates with accuracy comparable to or exceeding deterministic SIAC filter, while providing built-in uncertainty quantification and supporting general data models

Conclusion: Bayesian SIAC filter overcomes limitations of deterministic version by enabling rigorous uncertainty quantification and broader applicability to various data models

Abstract: We propose the Bayesian smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC)
filter -- a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the existing deterministic SIAC
filter. The SIAC filter is a powerful numerical tool for removing
high-frequency noise from data or numerical solutions without degrading
accuracy. However, current SIAC methodology is limited to (i) nodal data
(direct, typically noisy function values) and (ii) deterministic point
estimates that do not account for uncertainty propagation from input data to
the SIAC reconstruction. The proposed Bayesian SIAC filter overcomes these
limitations by (i) supporting general (non-nodal) data models and (ii) enabling
rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ), thereby broadening the applicability
of SIAC filtering. We also develop structure-exploiting algorithms for
efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling, with a focus on linear data models with additive Gaussian
noise. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian
SIAC filter across several applications, including signal denoising, image
deblurring, and post-processing of numerical solutions to hyperbolic
conservation laws. The results show that the Bayesian approach produces point
estimates with accuracy comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the
deterministic SIAC filter. In addition, it extends naturally to general data
models and provides built-in UQ.

### [10] [A class of flexible and efficient partitioned Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for some time-dependent partial differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14847)
*Xiao Tang,Junwei Huang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods for time-dependent PDEs transformed into ODEs with moderately stiff and non-stiff terms, using flexible RKC and RK methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many time-dependent PDEs become ODEs with both moderately stiff and non-stiff terms after spatial discretization, requiring efficient numerical methods that can handle both components effectively.

Method: Combines s-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method for moderately stiff terms with 4m-stage explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method for non-stiff terms, allowing flexible adjustment of both s and m parameters.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate superior flexibility and applicability compared to existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods with fixed-stage RK approaches.

Conclusion: The new partitioned explicit stabilized methods offer enhanced flexibility and performance for solving various PDE problems including advection-diffusion, Burgers, Brusselator, and damped wave equations.

Abstract: Many time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) can be transformed
into an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) containing moderately stiff and
non-stiff terms after spatial semi-discretization. In the present paper, we
construct a new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods
for the above ODEs. We treat the moderately stiff term with an s-stage
Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method and treat the non-stiff term with a 4m-stage
explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Different from several existing partitioned
explicit stabilized methods that employ fixed-stage RK methods to handle the
non-stiff term, both the parameters $s$ and $m$ in our methods can be flexibly
adjusted as needed for the problems. This feature endows our methods with
superior flexibility and applicability compared to several existing partitioned
explicit stabilized methods, as demonstrated in several specific numerical
examples (including the advection-diffusion equations, the Burgers equations,
the Brusselator equations and the damped wave equations).

*Maurice S. Fabien*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A cell centered Galerkin method combining finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin approaches for miscible displacement in porous media, offering comparable accuracy to higher-order DG methods with only one unknown per cell and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient computational method for miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media that maintains accuracy while reducing computational complexity compared to traditional higher-order discontinuous Galerkin methods.

Method: Cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method that combines finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin concepts, using classical DG weak formulations with only one unknown per cell, and includes mathematical proof of inverse-positive matrix properties for Poisson problems in 1D.

Result: The CCG method delivers comparable accuracy to traditional higher-order interior penalty DG methods while offering improved efficiency. Computational experiments in 2D and 3D demonstrate effectiveness for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems in porous media.

Conclusion: The CCG method provides an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional DG methods for porous media flow problems, achieving good performance with reduced computational requirements through its cell-centered approach with one unknown per cell.

Abstract: In this paper we present a cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method applied to
miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media. The CCG approach
combines concepts from finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to
arrive at an efficient lowest-order approximation (one unknown per cell). We
demonstrate that the CCG method can be defined using classical DG weak
formulations, only requires one unknown per cell, and is able to deliver
comparable accuracy and improved efficiency over traditional higher-order
interior penalty DG methods. In addition, we prove that the CCG method for a
model Poisson problem gives rise to a inverse-positive matrix in 1D. A plethora
of computational experiments in 2D and 3D showcase the effectiveness of the CCG
method for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems in porous media.
Comparisons between CCG and classical DG methods are included.

*Matteo Croci,Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali,Ian C. J. Powell*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation scheme for level-set approximation of Lipschitz multivariate functions with noise robustness and complexity reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a numerical method that can efficiently approximate level-sets of multivariate functions in the presence of stochastic noise, with automatic refinement near the level set boundary.

Method: Combines local function approximation with noise reduction in an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy that automatically refines regions close to the level set.

Result: Achieves ε-accurate approximations with expected cost complexity reduction of ε^{-(p+1)/(αp)} compared to non-adaptive schemes, where α is function approximation convergence rate and p relates to noise control in L^p space.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive scheme significantly reduces computational complexity for level-set approximation under stochastic noise, validated through numerical experiments including complex 2D/3D functions and PDE-based failure region estimation problems.

Abstract: We propose a new numerical scheme for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz
multivariate functions which is robust to stochastic noise. The algorithm's
main feature is an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy which
automatically refines the approximation over regions close to the level set.
This strategy combines a local function approximation method with a noise
reduction scheme and produces $\varepsilon$-accurate approximations with an
expected cost complexity reduction of $\varepsilon^{-\left(\frac{p+1}{\alpha
p}\right)}$ compared to a non-adaptive scheme, where $\alpha$ is the
convergence rate of the function approximation method and we assume that the
noise can be controlled in $L^p$. We provide numerical experiments in support
of our theoretical findings. These include 2- and 3-dimensional functions with
a complex level set structure, as well as a failure region estimation problem
described by a hyperelasticity partial differential equation with random field
coefficients.

*Clément Cancès,Claire Chainais-Hillairet,Amélie Dupouy*

TL;DR: Study of oxygen concentration evolution in oxide layers using convection-diffusion model with moving boundaries, showing existence of traveling-wave solutions and universal entropy structure, with development of unconditionally convergent numerical scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand oxygen concentration dynamics in oxide layers with moving boundaries, which is important for materials science and corrosion processes.

Method: Transient convection-diffusion equation in 1D variable-width domain with boundary motions governed by concentration traces. Analysis of traveling-wave solutions and entropy structure. Development of implicit ALE finite volume scheme with Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes.

Result: Established necessary/sufficient conditions for unique traveling-wave solution existence. Demonstrated universal entropy structure with dissipated free energies. Numerical scheme preserves traveling waves exactly and dissipates free energies unconditionally.

Conclusion: The model provides fundamental insights into oxide layer evolution, with the developed numerical scheme offering accurate and stable simulation capabilities that converge to traveling-wave solutions in long-time limits.

Abstract: We study a toy model for the evolution of the oxygen concentration in an
oxide layer. It consists in a transient convection diffusion equation in a
one-dimensional domain of variable width. The motions of the boundaries are
governed by the traces of the concentration. We exhibit a necessary and
sufficient condition on the parameters involved in the model for the existence
of a unique traveling-wave solution. Moreover, we show that the model admits
some universal entropy structure, in the sense that any convex function of the
concentration
  yields a dissipated free energy (up to exchanges with the outer environment
at the boundaries). We propose then an implicit in time arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian finite volume scheme based on Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes. It
is shown to be unconditionally convergent, to preserve exactly the travelling
wave, and to dissipate all the aforementioned free energies. Numerical
experiments show that our scheme is first order accurate in time and second
order in space, and that the transient solution converges in the long-time
limit towards the traveling-wave solution.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes late-time instability in marching-on-in-time solutions for the time-domain PMCHWT equation, identifying the static solenoidal nullspace of the electric field integral operator as the main cause.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address stability issues in time-domain PMCHWT equation solutions, particularly identifying the root causes of late-time instability that differ from other integral equations.

Method: Stability analysis of marching-on-in-time solutions, examining the spectral characteristics and numerical quadrature error sensitivity of the PMCHWT equation.

Result: Found that PMCHWT instability is caused by static solenoidal nullspace, is more sensitive to quadrature errors than EFIE, and depends on scatterer surface topology and smoothness.

Conclusion: The instability mechanisms of time-domain PMCHWT equation are fundamentally different from EFIE, requiring specialized treatment due to quadrature sensitivity and geometric dependence.

Abstract: This paper investigates the late-time instability of marching-on-in-time
solution to the time-domain PMCHWT equation. The stability analysis identifies
the static solenoidal nullspace of the time-domain electric field integral
operator as the primary cause of instability. Furthermore, it reveals that the
instability mechanisms of the time-domain PMCHWT equation are fundamentally
different from those of the time-domain electric field integral equation. In
particular, the PMCHWT's instability is much more sensitive to numerical
quadrature errors, and its spectral characteristics are strongly influenced by
the topology and smoothness of the scatterer surface.

TL;DR: FCPINN: Fourier-enhanced PINN for biharmonic equations that decomposes high-order PDEs into Poisson equations, improving accuracy and reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional PINNs in solving high-order biharmonic equations with complex boundary conditions by leveraging Fourier spectral theory.

Method: Decomposes biharmonic equations into two Poisson equations, integrates Fourier spectral theory with reduced-order formulation, and handles Dirichlet/Navier boundary conditions.

Result: Outperforms conventional PINN and MIM approaches in speed and accuracy for linear/nonlinear biharmonic problems across different Euclidean spaces.

Conclusion: FCPINN provides optimal speed-accuracy trade-off for high-order PDEs while maintaining stability with varying network architectures.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely utilized for
solving a range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various scientific
and engineering disciplines. This paper presents a Fourier heuristic-enhanced
PINN (termed FCPINN) designed to address a specific class of biharmonic
equations with Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions. The method achieves
this by decomposing the high-order equations into two Poisson equations. FCPINN
integrates Fourier spectral theory with a reduced-order formulation for
high-order PDEs, significantly improving approximation accuracy and reducing
computational complexity. This approach is especially beneficial for problems
with intricate boundary constraints and high-dimensional inputs. To assess the
effectiveness and robustness of the FCPINN algorithm, we conducted several
numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear biharmonic problems across
different Euclidean spaces. The results show that FCPINN provides an optimal
trade-off between speed and accuracy for high-order PDEs, surpassing the
performance of conventional PINN and deep mixed residual method (MIM)
approaches, while also maintaining stability and robustness with varying
numbers of hidden layer nodes.

### [16] [Linear non-divergence elliptic equations in a bounded, infinitely winding planar domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14352)
*Luan Hoang,Akif Ibragimov*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of second order elliptic equations in complex planar domains that wind infinitely around a circle, examining solution behavior with bounded/unbounded drifts and Dirichlet boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how solutions to non-divergence form elliptic equations behave in geometrically complex domains that wind infinitely around a fixed circle, particularly examining exponential growth/decay patterns and solution uniqueness.

Method: Studied homogeneous and inhomogeneous second order elliptic equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions in planar domains with infinite winding geometry, analyzing maximum solution behavior, oscillation estimates, and solution dependence on boundary data.

Result: Proved that maximum solution on cross-sections grows or decays exponentially as rotating angle approaches infinity for bounded drifts; similar behavior for unbounded drifts under growth constraints; established uniqueness and continuous dependence on boundary data.

Conclusion: Complex winding geometries produce exponential solution behavior patterns, with bounded/unbounded drifts affecting solution maxima, while maintaining solution uniqueness and stability properties for elliptic equations in such domains.

Abstract: We study the second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in a
planar domain with complicated geometry. In this case the domain winds around a
fixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle
goes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of
the solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle
either grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for
the oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for
inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to
infinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity.
For the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded
forcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and
its continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function.

TL;DR: Existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for nonlinear stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise on bounded domains, covering various physical systems like stochastic MHD, Brinkman-Forchheimer equations, and magneto-fluid models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified framework for analyzing a broad class of physically relevant nonlinear stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models that lack inherent cancellation structures, addressing the need for rigorous mathematical treatment of these complex systems.

Method: Uses Galerkin approximations and compactness arguments, derives strong moment bounds and verifies Cauchy properties for approximate solutions up to stopping times, applies Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes.

Result: Establishes existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions, with global solutions in two spatial dimensions, providing a unified treatment for various stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully handles a wide range of nonlinear stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise, offering comprehensive mathematical foundations for physically relevant systems in stochastic fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.

Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in the sense of
PDEs and probability, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\leq 3$), perturbed by spatially correlated multiplicative
noise. Our framework applies to many physically relevant systems, including
stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media,
stochastic convective dynamo models, and stochastic magneto-micropolar fluids,
among others. The analysis relies on Galerkin approximations and compactness
arguments. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and
verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any
inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for
stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal
strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions. These
results provide a unified treatment of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic
thermo-magneto-fluid models in the literature.

*Honggang Liu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence and uniqueness of topological solutions to skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs with asymptotic behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study topological solutions of Chern-Simons systems on discrete lattice graphs, which are important in theoretical physics and mathematical physics for understanding gauge field theories on discrete structures.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system using delta functions for topological defects, proving existence of solutions, analyzing asymptotic behaviors as λ approaches 0 and infinity, and establishing uniqueness conditions.

Result: Proved existence of topological solutions for any fixed g and h, obtained asymptotic behaviors as λ→0+ and λ→∞, and established uniqueness when lattice dimension is large enough or λ is sufficiently large.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes a comprehensive theory for topological solutions of Chern-Simons systems on lattice graphs, providing existence, asymptotic analysis, and uniqueness results under specific conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the topological solutions to the skew-symmetric
Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs: $$\left\{\begin{aligned} \Delta u
&=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}(\mathrm{e}^{u}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},
\Delta
\upsilon&=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{u}(\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},
\end{aligned} \right. $$ here, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_+$, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are
two positive integers, $m_j\in\mathbb{N}\, (j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_1)$,
$n_j\in\mathbb{N}\,(j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_2)$, and $\delta_{p}$ denotes the
Dirac mass at vertex $p$. Write $$g=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},\
h=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},\ B = 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j +
4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j.$$ For any fixed $g,h$, we prove the existence of the
topological solutions to the systems, then obtain the asymptotic behaviors of
topological solutions as $\lambda \rightarrow 0_+$ and $\lambda \rightarrow
+\infty$, and finally prove the uniqueness of the topological solutions when
the dimension of lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is large enough or $\lambda$ is
large enough.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of time discretization and vanishing discount problems for first-order discounted mean field games systems using weak KAM theory, including existence proofs and demonstration of non-uniqueness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key issues in first-order discounted mean field games: time discretization for proving solution existence, and vanishing discount problems for both the original and discretized systems.

Method: Time discretization approach combined with weak KAM theory to prove existence of solutions (viscosity solution u and projected minimizing measure m), and analysis of vanishing discount limits.

Result: Proved existence of solutions to the discounted mean field games system, analyzed vanishing discount problems, and provided an example showing non-uniqueness of solutions.

Conclusion: The time discretization method successfully establishes solution existence for discounted mean field games, while weak KAM theory provides effective tools for analyzing both discretized and vanishing discount problems, with non-uniqueness demonstrated through counterexamples.

Abstract: This article focuses two issues related to the first-order discounted mean
field games system. The first is the time discretization problem. The time
discretization approach enables us to prove the existence of solutions (u,m) of
the system, where u is a viscosity solution of the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi
equation and m is a projected minimizing measure satisfying the continuity
equation in the sense of distributions. The second is the vanishing discount
problems for both the discounted mean field games system and its discretized
system. The methods we use primarily derive from weak KAM theory. Moreover, we
provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of solutions to the
discounted mean field games system.

*Qinfeng Li,Juncheng Wei,Ruofei Yao*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Monotonicity of Robin torsion function in symmetric planar domains when Robin coefficient β ≥ -κ (boundary curvature), with counterexample showing sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish conditions under which the Robin torsion function exhibits monotonicity properties in symmetric planar domains, which has implications for understanding the behavior of solutions to Robin boundary value problems.

Method: Mathematical proof using symmetry arguments and analysis of the Robin boundary condition β ≥ -κ, supplemented by construction of a counterexample to demonstrate sharpness.

Result: Proved that the Robin torsion function is monotonic in smooth symmetric planar domains when β ≥ -κ, and showed this condition is sharp through counterexample construction.

Conclusion: The condition β ≥ -κ is both sufficient and essentially necessary for monotonicity of the Robin torsion function in symmetric planar domains, providing a precise threshold for this property.

Abstract: We prove the monotonicity property of the Robin torsion function in a smooth
planar domain $\Omega$ with a line of symmetry, provided that the Robin
coefficient $\beta$ is greater than or equal to the negative of the boundary
curvature $\kappa$ (i.e., $\beta \geq -\kappa$ on $\partial\Omega$). We also
show that this condition is, in a certain sense, sharp by constructing a
counterexample.

*Jinyuan Shang,Wenting Zhao,Xianjiu Huang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence of normalized solutions for Kirchhoff equations with mixed Choquard nonlinearities in R³, addressing challenges from nonlocal terms and energy estimates under L²-constraint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalize previous work by Wang et al. (2025) on nonlinear Kirchhoff equations with combined nonlinearities, extending the range of q from (2, 10/3) to (14/3, 6) and handling upper critical exponent related to Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.

Method: Employ subtle energy estimates under L²-constraint to achieve compactness recovery, while addressing difficulties from two nonlocal terms in the equation.

Result: Established existence results for normalized solutions to the Kirchhoff equation with mixed Choquard type nonlinearities in the specified parameter ranges.

Conclusion: Successfully generalized previous results and overcame challenges posed by nonlocal terms and compactness issues under L²-constraint, providing existence proofs for normalized solutions in the extended parameter range.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solution to the
following Kirchhoff equation with mixed Choquard type nonlinearities:
\begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\left(a + b \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2
\, dx\right) \Delta u - \lambda u = \mu |u|^{q-2} u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\alpha +
3}) |u|^{\alpha +1} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u^2 \,
dx = \rho^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a,b,\rho >0$, $\alpha \in
\left(0, 3\right)$, $\frac{14}{3} < q < 6$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ will
arise as a Lagrange multiplier. The quantity $\alpha + 3$ here represents the
upper critical exponent relevant to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality,
and this exponent can be regarded as equivalent to the Sobolev critical
exponent $2^*$. We generalize the results by Wang et al.(Discrete and
Continuous Dynamical Systems, 2025), which focused on nonlinear Kirchhoff
equations with combined nonlinearities when $2< q< \frac{10}{3}$. The primary
challenge lies in the necessity for subtle energy estimates under the
\(L^2\)-constraint to achieve compactness recovery. Meanwhile, we need to deal
with the difficulties created by the two nonlocal terms appearing in the
equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the analysis of nonlinear damped wave equations from Euclidean spaces to weighted graphs, establishing conditions for finite-time blow-up and optimal results

Method: Analysis of Cauchy problems for nonlinear damped wave equations on weighted graphs under specific volume growth conditions and initial data assumptions

Result: Proves nonexistence of global weak solutions and provides lifespan estimates for local weak solutions when blow-up occurs in finite time

Conclusion: The results are partially validated as optimal through application to n-dimensional integer lattice graphs, recovering known Euclidean results

Abstract: In this article, we are interested in studying the Cauchy problems for
nonlinear damped wave equations and their systems on a weighted graph. Our main
purpose is two-fold, namely, under certain conditions for volume growth of a
ball and the initial data we would like to not only prove nonexistence of
global (in time) weak solutions but also indicate lifespan estimates for local
(in time) weak solutions when a blow-up phenomenon in finite time occurs.
Throughout the present paper, we will partially give a positive answer for the
optimality of our results by an application to the $n$-dimensional integer
lattice graph $\Z^n$ to recover the well-known results in the Euclidean
setting.

Motivation: To establish existence and regularity properties for solutions to a class of nonlinear degenerate-elliptic equations that generalize Leray-Lions type equations, particularly when dealing with measurable coefficients and vector fields satisfying Poincaré inequality and doubling conditions

Method: Proving existence results for solutions to nonlinear degenerate-elliptic equations in divergence form with measurable coefficients and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, using operators associated with vector fields that satisfy Poincaré inequality and doubling condition

Result: Successfully proved existence of solutions and demonstrated that these solutions satisfy a generalization of L^p-regularity results that are known to hold for solutions to Leray-Lions type equations

Conclusion: The paper establishes important existence and regularity properties for a broad class of nonlinear degenerate-elliptic equations, extending known results from Leray-Lions equations to more general settings with measurable coefficients and specific structural conditions on the vector fields

Abstract: We prove an existence result for solutions to a class of nonlinear
degenerate-elliptic equations with measurable coefficients and zero Dirichlet
boundary condition. The main term is given by a nonlinear operator in
divergence form associated to a family of vector fields which satisfy a
Poincar\'e inequality and the doubling condition.
  Furthermore, we prove that the solutions satisfy a generalization of the
$L^p$-regularity results which hold for the solutions to Leray-Lions type
equations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the fundamental open problem of well-posedness for Boltzmann and Landau equations in critical function spaces, which is crucial for kinetic theory.

Method: Developed a new analytical framework with novel anisotropic norms adapted to scaling invariance, leveraged regularizing effects and decomposition of linearized collision operator.

Result: Successfully established local well-posedness near global Maxwellian and extended to global solutions with pointwise decay estimates for small initial perturbations.

Conclusion: Resolves fundamental issue in kinetic theory and provides a new approach applicable to broader class of kinetic models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous Boltzmann and
Landau equations in critical function spaces, a fundamental open problem in
kinetic theory. We develop a new analytical framework to establish local
well-posedness near a global Maxwellian for both equations, under the
assumption that the initial perturbation is small in a critical norm. A major
contribution lies in the introduction of a novel anisotropic norm adapted to
the intrinsic scaling invariance of the equations, which provides precise
control over the high-frequency behavior of solutions. By leveraging the
regularizing effect and a decomposition of the linearized collision operator,
we further extend the local solution globally in time and establish pointwise
decay estimates. Our work not only resolves a fundamental issue in the theory
of kinetic equations in critical spaces, but also provides a new approach
applicable to a broader class of kinetic models.

Conclusion: Successfully established invariant Gibbs dynamics for NLS on the disc with strong solutions

Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
(NLS) on the unit disc in the plane with the Gibbs initial data under radial
symmetry. By using a type of random averaging operator ansatz, we build a
strong local-in-time solution theory, and thus prove almost sure global
well-posedness and invariance of the Gibbs measure via Bourgain's invariant
measure argument. This work completes the program initiated by Tzvetkov (2006,

*Argenis J. Méndez,Oscar Riaño*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: New monotonicity formula for fractional Laplacian enables localized analysis of L^2-mass preservation in dispersive equations, applied to prove conditional instability of Shrira equation traveling waves without pointwise decay estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust framework for analyzing monotonicity properties in higher dimensions and understand the interplay between nonlocal dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

Method: Employed a new class of pseudo-differential operators to establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian |∇ₓ|ᵅ in ℝⁿ, enabling localized analysis of L^2-mass preservation in specific regions.

Result: Proved conditional instability results for traveling wave solutions of the Shrira equation in the critical regime, derived virial-type estimates for long-time behavior, and established instability without requiring pointwise decay estimates.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible method for extending monotonicity techniques to higher dimensions and reveals insights into the relationship between nonlocal dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

Abstract: By employing a new class of pseudo-differential operators introduced in a
previous work, we establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional
Laplacian $|\nabla_x|^\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 2$ and $\alpha
\in [1,2)$, This framework enables us to localize our analysis to specific
regions of Euclidean space where monotonicity properties of the $L^2$-mass of
solutions to dispersive equations with fractional dispersion are preserved.
  As an application, we focus on the Shrira equation, proving conditional
instability results for its traveling wave solutions in the critical regime. We
deduce key virial-type estimates that govern the long-time behavior of the
$L^2$-mass. As a consequence, we establish instability results without
requiring pointwise decay estimates employed in previous works. Our approach
provides a robust and flexible method for monotonicity techniques to higher
dimensions, shedding light on the delicate interplay between nonlocal
dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

*Mitsuo Higaki,Jiajiang Liao,Franck Sueur*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study investigates Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible fluid in perforated domains with small holes, addressing boundary layer challenges through homogenization and stability estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in Lagrangian controllability for Navier-Stokes equations with no-slip boundary conditions on solid boundaries, particularly dealing with difficulties from viscous boundary layers in bounded domains.

Method: Uses homogenization for evolutionary problems, weak-strong stability estimates in measure of flows, Runge-type approximations for elliptic equations, and Cauchy-Kowalevsky theorems for equations with analytic coefficients.

Result: Develops quantitative framework distinguishing situations based on hole parameters (diameter and distance) and fluid parameters (size of initial data) for controllability in perforated domains.

Conclusion: Provides approach to achieve Lagrangian controllability in viscous fluids within perforated domains by leveraging homogenization techniques that connect Navier-Stokes to Euler/Darcy equations through vanishing viscosity limits.

Abstract: The question at stake in Lagrangian controllability is whether one can move a
patch of fluid particles to a target location by means of remote action in a
given time interval. In the last two decades, positive results have been
obtained both for the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.
However, for the latter, the case where the fluid is contained within domains
bounded by solid boundaries with the no-slip condition has not been addressed,
with respect to the difficulty caused by viscous boundary layers. In this
paper, we investigate the Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible
fluid in perforated domains for which the fraction of volume occupied by the
holes is sufficiently small. Moreover, we quantitatively distinguish situations
depending on the parameters for holes (diameter and distance) and for fluid
(size of the initial data). Our approach relies on recent results on
homogenization for evolutionary problems and on weak-strong stability estimates
in measure of flows, alongside classical results on Runge-type approximations
for elliptic equations and on Cauchy-Kowalevsky-type theorems for equations
with analytic coefficients. Here, homogenization refers to the vanishing
viscosity limit outside a porous medium, where (after scaling in time) the
Navier-Stokes equations are homogenized to the Euler or Darcy equations.

TL;DR: Novel inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces, using boundary measurements to uniquely recover inclusion shape and interface parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop practical nondestructive detection methods for interior inhomogeneities and damaged subvolumes in elastic materials with complex interfaces.

Method: Adapted factorization method to handle higher-order boundary operators and nontrivial null spaces, using displacement-stress measurements through Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

Result: Demonstrated uniqueness in recovering shear parameters, interface properties, and inclusion shape from boundary measurements.

Conclusion: The framework provides a feasible approach for nondestructive detection of interior defects, with numerical experiments confirming practical applicability.

Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic
bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic
elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with
higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the
exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we
show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well
as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt
the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the
higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical
experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the
framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of
interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.

*Allen H Boozer*

TL;DR: Electron inertia enables magnetic reconnection without other non-ideal effects, with a modified field evolving ideally while particle trajectories remain largely unaffected except in thin current sheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that finite electron mass alone can cause magnetic reconnection and identify a related field that evolves ideally despite electron inertia effects.

Method: Analysis of magnetic field evolution with electron inertia as the only non-ideal effect, introducing a modified field β = B + ∇×((m_e/ne²)j) that evolves ideally.

Result: Found that electron inertia modifies magnetic field evolution but has minimal effect on particle trajectories unless currents are concentrated in thin sheets. The modified field β is related to Voigt normalized magnetic field through Laplacian smoothing.

Conclusion: Electron inertia provides a fundamental mechanism for magnetic reconnection, with the modified field β offering an ideal evolution framework while preserving particle trajectory integrity in most cases.

Abstract: The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence
of any other non-ideal effect in a magnetic evolution. It will be shown that
when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the
magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This
field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n
e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number
density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is
modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on
particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current
lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field
$\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field,
which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between
$\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant
four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing
distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes a three-loop spatial linkage from previous research, showing it has finite DOF 3 (overconstrained) but differential DOF 5 in reference configuration, with smooth manifold c-space and constant differential DOF indicating shakiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and provide deeper analysis of a previously studied three-loop spatial linkage, clarifying its kinematic properties and resolving questions about its degree of freedom and singularity characteristics.

Method: Local analysis using kinematic tangent cone computation and local approximation of configuration space to examine the linkage's finite and differential degrees of freedom.

Result: The linkage has finite DOF 3 (overconstrained) but differential DOF 5 in reference configuration. The configuration space is a smooth manifold, reference configuration is not a singularity, and differential DOF is locally constant indicating the linkage is shaky.

Conclusion: The three-loop spatial linkage exhibits shakiness with locally constant differential DOF, and the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity despite the discrepancy between finite and differential degrees of freedom.

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate myocardial displacement reconstruction from sparse clinical imaging, but current methods often need intrusive access to computational models.

Method: Applied Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach using only solution snapshots without governing equations. Introduced H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for efficient sensor selection and memory optimization techniques for vectorial problems.

Result: Exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (O(1e-2)), effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (O(1e-2)). 4-order-of-magnitude speed-up vs full FE simulations, reconstruction under 0.1 seconds.

Conclusion: Method shows significant potential for clinical cardiac modeling workflows with non-intrusive deployment, high accuracy, and real-time reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of
myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current
methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we
apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to
three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited
Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires
only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver
access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes
using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two
enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP)
algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while
maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques
exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model
with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we
systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking
realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in
noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance
with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective
reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)).
The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational
speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction
times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant
potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and classify the diverse rule variants of the Schelling model, which serves as a prototype for agent-based social system modeling, and understand the drivers of segregation transitions.

Method: Classification of macroscopic outcomes through phase diagrams for 54 different rule variants, analyzing statistical and dynamic drivers including vision, movement criteria, vacancies, initial state, and rivalry using both sociological and percolation-inspired segregation measures.

Result: Only 3 distinct phase diagram classes were identified among all 54 variants, characterized by the number of phase transitions. Schelling's original step function was found to be problematic at high thresholds, causing coordination failures. The classification proved robust across different segregation measurement approaches.

Conclusion: This comprehensive classification provides new insights into transition drivers in the Schelling model and establishes a foundation for studying more complex Schelling-like models, revealing the model's fundamental behavioral patterns despite rule variations.

Abstract: The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social
systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved
by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams.
Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized
by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be
robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of
segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are
elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the
initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating
satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing
coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This
comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions
in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex
Schelling-like models.

### [34] [Efficient Computation of Time-Index Powered Weighted Sums Using Cascaded Accumulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15069)
*Deijany Rodriguez Linares,Oksana Moryakova,Håkan Johansson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel method for efficiently computing time-index powered weighted sums using cascaded accumulators, reducing computational cost from K×N multiplications to only K+1 constant multiplications without requiring data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computation of time-index powered weighted sums requires K×N general multiplications which becomes prohibitive for large N, and alternative methods require storing entire data blocks, making real-time implementation inefficient.

Method: The proposed approach uses cascaded accumulators to exploit their properties, eliminating the need for data storage and reducing the computational complexity significantly.

Result: The method achieves a dramatic reduction in multiplicative cost from K×N to only K+1 constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time implementation in sample-by-sample processing systems.

Conclusion: This cascaded accumulator approach provides an efficient solution for computing time-index powered weighted sums without data storage requirements, making it particularly suitable for real-time processing applications.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing
time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$
using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires
$K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,
while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require
storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed
method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost
to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time
implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be
efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-PINN is a new uncertainty-aware Physics-Informed Neural Network that uses evidential deep learning for better uncertainty estimation and parameter inference in PDEs, outperforming Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more reliable uncertainty-aware PINN framework that can better estimate uncertainty in outputs and infer unknown PDE parameters through learned posterior distributions.

Method: Leverages marginal distribution loss function from evidential deep learning for uncertainty estimation, infers unknown PDE parameters via learned posterior distribution, validated on 1D Poisson equation and 2D Fisher-KPP equation.

Result: E-PINN generated significantly better calibrated empirical coverage probabilities compared to Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods, and demonstrated real-world applicability in clinical glucose-insulin dataset analysis.

Conclusion: E-PINN provides a superior uncertainty-aware framework for PINNs with better calibration and practical applicability in real-world problems like medical research.

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying
Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of
uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of
evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers
unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating
our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a
Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated
empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than
Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world
applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze
clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on
diabetes pathophysiology.

*Nishantak Panigrahi,Mayank Patwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs for approximating nonlocal conservation law solutions from Kuramoto model, focusing on architecture impact on accuracy and computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate efficiency of Deep Neural Networks for solving nonlocal conservation laws derived from identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, evaluating architectural choices and their impact on solution accuracy.

Method: Systematic experimentation with network configuration parameters including activation functions (tanh, sin, ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width (64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch count). Comparative analysis with traditional numerical methods.

Result: Tanh activation yields stable convergence, sine activation can achieve marginally lower errors and training times but occasionally produces nonphysical artefacts. Optimally configured DNNs offer competitive accuracy with different computational trade-offs. Standard feed-forward architectures have limitations with singular or piecewise-constant solutions, oversmoothing sharp features.

Conclusion: Provides empirical guidelines for DNN implementation in scientific computing while identifying fundamental theoretical constraints that need to be overcome for handling challenging physical systems with discontinuities.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Numerical analysis shows million-atom metamaterial samples with sharp edges differ significantly from homogenized materials and are critically sensitive to shape and boundary structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common belief that large metamaterial samples behave as uniform homogenized materials and to understand the electromagnetic properties of discrete volumetric metamaterials.

Method: Developed an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response in samples containing several million meta-atoms, comparing results with discrete dipole approximation and integral models for continuous particles.

Result: Even million-atom samples with sharp edges are quite different from uniform homogenized materials, with properties critically sensitive to shape and boundary structure. Discrete metamaterials serve as a stringent platform for assessing continuous models.

Conclusion: The findings are important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements and demonstrate that discrete structure effects persist even in large-scale metamaterial samples.

Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial
samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic
array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical
procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to
analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that,
contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges
are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their
properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We
also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole
approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and
analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In
particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform
for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges.
Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic
systems with strongly interacting elements.

*Liheng Wang,Licheng Zhang,Hailin Xu,Jingxin Zhao,Xiuyun Su,Jiantao Li,Miutian Tang,Weilu Gao,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm for bone segmentation that combines intensity and gradient information with distance-based fracture prompts to handle edge obstruction, leakage, and fractures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geodesic active contour models struggle with bone segmentation due to indiscriminate feature extraction, edge obstruction by soft tissues, edge leakage, and bone fracture handling.

Method: Proposed algorithm constructs a novel edge-detector function combining intensity and gradient norm, and introduces distance information with fracture prompts as adaptive step size in contour evolution.

Result: Experiments on pelvic and ankle segmentation show effective handling of edge obstruction, leakage, and fractures with accurate, stable, and consistent performance.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully addresses bone segmentation challenges and provides insights for combining domain knowledge with deep neural networks for broader bone anatomy applications.

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

### [39] [Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14702)
*Yagyank Srivastava,Amey G. Gokhale,Ankit Jain*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity predictions vary significantly based on BTE solvers, DFT packages, exchange-correlation functionals, and machine learning forcefields, with functional choice causing the largest errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation-based thermal conductivity predictions arising from different computational methods, solvers, and force models to guide reliable material screening.

Method: Compared 50 semiconductors using different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, in-house code), DFT packages (Quantum Espresso, VASP) with various functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, rSCAN), and pre-trained machine learning forcefields.

Result: BTE solvers show minimal uncertainty (1% MAPE), DFT packages cause ~10% error, exchange-correlation functionals create >20% error, and ML forcefields predict trends but with high errors.

Conclusion: Choice of exchange-correlation functional introduces the largest uncertainty, while BTE solvers are highly consistent; ML models need improvement for reliable material screening applications.

Abstract: We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation
(BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse
semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and
in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained
either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages
Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation
functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational
machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
  We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and,
using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent
agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only
1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT
packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of
stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in
thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation
functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available
pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal
conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications
for coarse screening of materials.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Study uses Landauer approach to analyze thermoelectric efficiency of scandium nitride (ScN), focusing on oxygen impurities and vacancies' impact on electronic transport, providing theoretical interpretation of experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transition-metal nitrides like ScN show promise for energy conversion applications, but their thermoelectric properties are highly sensitive to fabrication procedures and defects.

Method: Used Landauer approach to model electronic and structural modifications from oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies in ScN nanostructures.

Result: Thermoelectric properties of ScN are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors from defects/impurities, explaining experimental observations of fabrication-dependent performance.

Conclusion: This theoretical approach shows potential for studying thermoelectricity and developing strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency in materials like ScN.

Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential
applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach
to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of
scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of
electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and
spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking
advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical
interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of
the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during
fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by
structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our
findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying
thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric
efficiency.

*Zhaobo Zhou,Sangeeta Sharma,Junjie He*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Laser-induced demagnetization in g-wave altermagnet CrSb shows direction-dependent behavior, with normal incidence preserving zero net magnetization and off-normal incidence creating transient ferrimagnetic-like states due to anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets affect light-induced spin responses, which remain poorly understood despite their potential for spintronic applications.

Method: Used time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in g-wave altermagnet CrSb, comparing with d-wave altermagnets and analyzing laser incidence direction effects.

Result: Normal incidence along [0001] axis causes symmetric demagnetization with different amplitudes but preserves net-zero magnetization. Off-normal incidence induces asymmetric demagnetization, creating transient ferrimagnetic-like states with sizable net magnetization due to anisotropic OISTR from nodal structures.

Conclusion: Light-induced magnetization occurs when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures, which can be determined from local spin density of states along specific band paths, providing fundamental understanding for ultrafast dynamics in altermagnets.

Abstract: The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause
distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced
ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed
by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis,
two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with
different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the
behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced
asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system
into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This
direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in
bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite
spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that
light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with
spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily
determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our
results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast
dynamics in AM.

*Simon A. Mason,Megna N. Shah,Jeffrey P. Simmons,Dennis M. Dimiduk,Stephen R. Niezgoda*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A framework for mapping microstructure onto low-dimensional material manifolds parametrized by processing conditions, using stochastic process treatment and various microstructure descriptors to achieve invertible processing-structure mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties, necessitating better methods to capture process-dependent microstructural features.

Method: Treating microstructure as a stochastic process (distribution of instances), leveraging manifold hypothesis, and comparing multiple descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, persistent homology) using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition.

Result: Distribution-based descriptors recover a two-dimensional latent structure aligned with true processing parameters, creating invertible and interpretable mapping, while non-variability-aware descriptors overestimate dimensionality or lose fidelity.

Conclusion: The material manifold approach provides quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and enables closed-loop optimization of processing-structure-property relationships.

Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between
processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a
framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold
that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating
microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of
microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction
of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent
features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural
outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few
parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model
material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point
statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of
two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)
invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate
that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent
structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible
and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In
contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either
overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed
material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in
process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors.
This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation
for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop
optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated
materials engineering context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of conventional continuous forcing approaches in accurately evaluating velocity gradient on boundaries for flows with surface slip conditions.

Method: Implicit projection method that determines wall slip velocity and boundary force simultaneously to satisfy boundary conditions and divergence-free velocity field constraints. First-order accurate in space and fourth-order accurate in time.

Result: Simulations of flow past stationary and moving circular cylinders show good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results across a wide range of slip lengths, including no-slip cases.

Conclusion: The presented method successfully handles surface slip conditions using Navier boundary condition and provides accurate results for both stationary and moving bodies with various slip lengths.

Abstract: A formulation of the immersed boundary method for incompressible flow over

presented. In the present method, the wall slip velocity and the boundary force
are determined implicitly through a projection to satisfy the boundary

constraints. The present method is first-order accurate in space and
fourth-order accurate in time, overcoming the difficulty of the conventional
continuous forcing approaches to accurately evaluate the velocity gradient on
the boundary. Results from the simulation of the flow past stationary and
moving circular cylinders are in good agreement with previous experimental and
numerical results for a wide range of slip length on the surface, including the

TL;DR: Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering weighted point sources in heat equation from boundary flux data, combining level set representation and Poisson point process thinning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of constructing suitable priors for highly structured unknowns in classical Bayesian framework for point source reconstruction.

Method: Level set representation on discretized mesh + marked Poisson point process with thinning mechanism to generate and refine candidate point sources.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate accurate reconstruction of point sources.

Conclusion: Combined Bayesian level set sampling and thinning process provides effective framework for point source recovery in heat equations.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering
weighted point source functions in the heat equation from boundary flux
observations. The major challenge in the classical Bayesian framework lies in
constructing suitable priors for such highly structured unknowns. To address
this, we introduce a level set representation on a discretized mesh for the
unknown, which enables the infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework to the
reconstruction. From another perspective, the point source configuration can be
modeled as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), then a thinning mechanism is
employed to selectively retain points. These two proposals are complementary
with the Bayesian level set sampling generating candidate point sources and the
thinning process acting as a filter to refine them. This combined framework is
validated through numerical experiments, which demonstrate its accuracy in
reconstructing point sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend fundamental gap results from Euclidean and spherical domains to Gaussian spaces, which are fundamentally important settings

Method: Prove lower bound by comparing with one-dimensional Schrödinger operator gap, show monotonicity of normalized gap with diameter, and demonstrate sharpness of estimate

Result: Established that gap is bounded below by corresponding 1D Schrödinger operator gap, proved monotonicity property, and confirmed sharpness of the estimate

Conclusion: Successfully extends previous seminal results to Gaussian space setting, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the fundamental gap conjecture with sharp bounds

Abstract: We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap of convex domains in
Gaussian space, the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main result
establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of a corresponding
one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the
fundamental gap conjecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalized gap
of the one dimensional model is monotonically increasing with the diameter and
prove the sharpness of our estimate. This work extends the seminal results of
Andrews and Clutterbuck for Euclidean domains and Seto, Wang and Wei for
spherical domains to the fundamentally important setting of Gaussian spaces.
