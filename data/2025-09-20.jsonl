In this work, we\napply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to\nthree-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited\nMagnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires\nonly solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver\naccess -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes\nusing different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two\nenhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP)\nalgorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while\nmaintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques\nexploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model\nwith simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we\nsystematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking\nrealistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in\nnoise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance\nwith 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective\nreconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)).\nThe online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational\nspeed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction\ntimes under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant\npotential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows."}

Traditional direct computation requires\n$K{\\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,\nwhile alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require\nstoring entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed\nmethod eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost\nto only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time\nimplementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be\nefficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems."}
