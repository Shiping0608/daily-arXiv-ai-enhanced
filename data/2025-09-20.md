### [1] [On the extension of a class of Hermite bivariate interpolation problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14359)
*Hakop Hakopian,Anush Khachatryan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Characterization of solvability sets for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems when sum of multiplicities ≤ 2n+2, extending previous 2n+1 result and generalizing Severi's classical theorem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of Hermite bivariate interpolation solvability beyond the previously established 2n+1 multiplicity sum limit to 2n+2, building on earlier work and classical foundations.

Method: Mathematical characterization and analysis of solvability conditions for Hermite bivariate interpolation problems using polynomial spaces of degree n.

Result: Successfully characterized the sets of solvability for Hermite bivariate interpolation when the sum of multiplicities is at most 2n+2.

Conclusion: This work provides an important extension of interpolation theory, generalizing previous results and connecting to classical mathematical foundations in the field.

Abstract: We characterize the sets of solvability for Hermite bivariate interpolation
problems when the sum of multiplicities is at most $2n + 2$, with $n$ the
degree of the polynomial space. This result extends an earlier theorem (2000)
by one of the authors concerning the case $2n+1$. The latter theorem, in turn,
can be regarded as a natural generalization of a classical theorem of Severi
(1921).

### [2] [Error analysis of a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element scheme for a diffuse-interface model of tumour growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14486)
*Agus L. Soenjaya,Ping Lin,Thanh Tran*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A structure-preserving finite element method for tumor growth modeling using Cahn-Hilliard and reaction-diffusion equations with SAV formulation, achieving linear, energy-stable, mass-preserving discretization with optimal convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a numerical method for tumor growth modeling that preserves the dissipative energy structure of the continuous diffuse-interface model while maintaining computational efficiency and stability.

Method: Combines scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation with mixed finite elements for Cahn-Hilliard and standard conforming elements for reaction-diffusion, using first-order Euler time-stepping. The method is linear, energy-stable, and mass-preserving.

Result: The method achieves unconditional energy stability, preserves mass, requires only linear systems per time step, and demonstrates first-order time accuracy and optimal-order spatial accuracy with rigorous error estimates in L2, H1, and L∞ norms.

Conclusion: The developed method successfully captures tumor growth phenomena like aggregation and chemotaxis while maintaining mathematical structure preservation, computational efficiency, and proven convergence properties.

Abstract: We develop a fully discrete structure-preserving finite element method for a
diffuse-interface model of tumour growth. The system couples a Cahn--Hilliard
type equation with a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation for nutrient
concentration and admits a dissipative energy law at the continuous level. For
the discretisation, we employ a scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) formulation
together with a mixed finite element method for the Cahn--Hilliard part and
standard conforming finite elements for the reaction-diffusion equation in
space, combined with a first-order Euler time-stepping scheme. The resulting
method is linear, unconditionally energy-stable, mass-preserving, and inherits
a discrete energy dissipation law associated with the SAV-based approximate
energy functional, while requiring the solution of only linear systems at each
time step. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, we
derive rigorous error estimates in $L^2$, $H^1$, and $L^\infty$ norms,
establishing first-order accuracy in time and optimal-order accuracy in space.
A key step in this analysis is the proof of boundedness of the numerical
solutions in $L^\infty$. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical
convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness of the method in capturing
characteristic phenomena such as aggregation and chemotactic tumour growth.

### [3] [The extended horizontal linear complementarity problem: iterative methods and error analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14491)
*Shi-Liang Wu,Cui-Xia Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the extended horizontal linear complementarity problem (EHLCP) by developing iterative methods, convergence analysis, and error bounds for the first time since its introduction in 1977.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EHLCP has remained unsolved with iterative methods for decades due to its complex 'chain-like' structure with interdependent multiple unknowns, creating a significant research gap.

Method: Proposed an equivalent fixed-point formulation using variable transformation with max-min function, developed efficient iterative methods with convergence analysis, and derived global error bounds and computable estimates.

Result: Successfully developed the first iterative methods for EHLCP with proven convergence properties and established error bounds, validated through numerical examples from multicommodity market equilibrium and bilateral obstacle problems.

Conclusion: The paper fills a 40+ year research gap by providing effective computational methods and theoretical foundations for solving EHLCP, demonstrating practical applicability across various domains.

Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, since the extended horizontal linear
complementarity problem (EHLCP) was first introduced and studied by Kaneko in
1977, no iterative methods or error analysis have been developed for it due to
the interdependence of its multiple unknowns in a 'chain-like' structure. This
paper aims to address these gaps by:
  (1) proposing an equivalent fixed-point formulation of the EHLCP by using a
variable transformation technique with the max-min function;
  (2) developing efficient iterative methods for solving the EHLCP based on
this fixed-point form, along with their convergence analysis;
  (3) deriving global error bounds and computable estimates for the EHLCP.
  Several numerical examples from applications such as multicommodity market
equilibrium and bilateral obstacle problems are given to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods and bounds.

### [4] [The whys and hows of conditioning of DG plane wave Trefftz methods: a single element](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14500)
*Joseph Coyle,Nilima Nigam*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of plane-wave Trefftz methods for Helmholtz equation, focusing on conditioning issues and preconditioning strategies for single disk-shaped elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plane-wave Trefftz methods offer advantages over standard polynomial-based approaches but suffer from poor conditioning of system matrices, which needs to be addressed.

Method: Study conditioning of plane-wave discontinuous Galerkin method on single disk-shaped element, examining mass and stiffness matrices, and testing preconditioning strategies using conditioning metrics, GMRES residuals, and L^2-error impact.

Result: The paper examines how element size and geometry affect matrix properties and evaluates preconditioning effectiveness through multiple criteria.

Conclusion: Preconditioning strategies can improve the performance of plane-wave Trefftz methods by addressing conditioning issues, though effectiveness depends on element characteristics.

Abstract: Plane-wave Trefftz methods (PWB) for the Helmholtz equation offer significant
advantages over standard discretization approaches whose implementation employs
more general polynomial basis functions. A disadvantage of these methods is the
poor conditioning of the system matrices. In the present paper, we carefully
examine the conditioning of the plane-wave discontinuous Galerkin method with
reference to a single element. The properties of the mass and stiffness
matrices depend on the size and geometry of the element. We study the mass and
system matrices arising from a PWB on a single disk-shaped element. We then
examine some preconditioning strategies, and present results showing their
behaviour with three different criteria: conditioning, the behaviour of GMRES
residuals, and impact on the $L^2$-error.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations using neural samplers via weak adversarial framework with plane-wave test functions


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of density-based methods for solving Fokker-Planck equations and handle distributions without densities while enforcing probability conservation

Method: Represent solution distribution through neural pushforward map, use computationally efficient plane-wave test functions with explicitly computed derivatives in a weak adversarial framework

Result: Method can handle distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability conservation

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective framework for solving Fokker-Planck equations with improved computational efficiency and broader applicability compared to traditional density-based methods

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations by
learning neural samplers via a weak adversarial framework. We represent the
solution distribution through a neural pushforward map, bypassing the
limitations of density-based methods. A key innovation is our use of
computationally efficient plane-wave test functions, whose derivatives are
explicitly computed -- a treatment distinct from prior work. This approach
handles distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability
conservation.

### [6] [A Weighted Sampling Method for Inverse Medium Problem with Limited Aperture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14580)
*Fuqun Han,Kazufumi Ito*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new sampling method for inverse medium scattering problems with limited-aperture data that improves reconstruction accuracy and stability compared to classical methods like MUSIC and linear sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement data in practical applications are often restricted to limited apertures due to physical or experimental constraints, causing classical sampling methods to perform poorly, especially with noise.

Method: Proposes a weighted sampling method based on linear sampling framework that incorporates a weight function into the index function. The weight is designed to reproduce full-aperture behavior using limited data, localizing oscillations and improving system conditioning.

Result: Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D demonstrate the method achieves greater accuracy and robustness than existing sampling-type methods, particularly for noisy limited-aperture data.

Conclusion: The proposed weighted sampling method effectively addresses limitations of classical approaches for inverse medium scattering with limited-aperture measurements, providing more accurate and stable reconstructions.

Abstract: Inverse medium scattering problems arise in many applications, but in
practice, the measurement data are often restricted to a limited aperture by
physical or experimental constraints. Classical sampling methods, such as MUSIC
and the linear sampling method, are well understood for full-aperture data, yet
their performance deteriorates severely under limited-aperture conditions,
especially in the presence of noise. We propose a new sampling method tailored
to the inverse medium problem with limited-aperture data. The method is
motivated by the linear sampling framework and incorporates a weight function
into the index function. The weight is designed so that the modified kernel
reproduces the full-aperture behavior using only limited data, which both
localizes oscillations and improves the conditioning of the far-field system,
thereby yielding more accurate and stable reconstructions. We provide a
theoretical justification of the method under the Born approximation and an
efficient algorithm for computing the weight. Numerical experiments in two and
three dimensions demonstrate that the proposed method achieves greater accuracy
and robustness than existing sampling-type methods, particularly for noisy,
limited-aperture data.

TL;DR: Analysis of Chebyshev coefficient decay and local approximations for functions on shrinking intervals with fixed node count, deriving error estimates for coefficient decay, approximation errors, and quadrature convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill a gap in existing theory by providing a unified rigorous framework for understanding how Chebyshev approximation accuracy scales on shrinking intervals, which is crucial for high-order numerical methods on decomposed domains.

Method: Analyzed decay of Chebyshev coefficients and local approximations for functions of finite regularity, focusing on the asymptotic framework where interval length tends to zero while number of approximation nodes remains fixed. Derived error estimates for all four families of Chebyshev polynomials.

Result: Derived comprehensive error estimates quantifying dependence on interval length for: (i) Chebyshev coefficient decay, (ii) approximation error between continuous/discrete coefficients, and (iii) convergence of Chebyshev-based quadrature rules. Numerical experiments confirmed theoretical decay rates and error behavior.

Conclusion: The results provide rigorous theoretical foundation and practical guidance for high-order numerical methods on decomposed domains, offering new insights into Chebyshev approximation scaling behavior on shrinking intervals.

Abstract: We analyze decay of Chebyshev coefficients and local Chebyshev approximations
for functions of finite regularity on finite intervals, focusing on the
framework where the interval length tends to zero while the number of
approximation nodes remains fixed. For all four families of Chebyshev
polynomials, we derive error estimates that quantify the dependence on the
interval length for (i) the decay of Chebyshev coefficients, (ii) the
approximation error between continuous and discrete Chebyshev coefficients, and
(iii) the convergence of Chebyshev-based quadrature rules. These results fill a
gap in the existing theory and provide a unified and rigorous description of
how approximation accuracy scales on shrinking intervals, offering new
theoretical insight and practical guidance for high-order numerical methods on
decomposed domains. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results,
confirming the decay rates and illustrating the error behavior in practice.

### [8] [Unconditional and optimal error analysis of two linearized finite difference schemes for the logarithmic Schrödinger equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14736)
*Tingchun Wang,Jingye Yan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Two linearized finite difference schemes for solving logarithmic Schrödinger equation without regularization, with improved error estimates and no time step restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient numerical methods for the logarithmic Schrödinger equation that overcome the singularity of the logarithmic term and provide better error estimates without restrictive conditions.

Method: First-order and second-order backward difference formulas for temporal discretization combined with second-order central finite difference for spatial discretization.

Result: Optimal l²-error estimates for first-order scheme, almost optimal for second-order scheme, plus H¹ error estimates without grid ratio restrictions or enhanced regularity requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes significantly improve convergence rates, eliminate time step restrictions, and provide superior error estimates compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose two linearized finite difference schemes for
solving the logarithmic Schr\"odinger equation (LogSE) without the need for
regularization of the logarithmic term. These two schemes employ the
first-order and the second-order backward difference formula, respectively, for
temporal discretization of the LogSE, while using the second-order central
finite difference method for spatial discretization. We overcome the
singularity posed by the logarithmic nonlinearity $f(u)=u\ln|u|$ in
establishing optimal $l^{2}$-error estimates for the first-order scheme, and an
almost optimal $l^{2}$-error estimate for the second-order scheme. Compared to
the error estimates of the LogSE in the literature, our error bounds not only
greatly improve the convergence rate but also get rid of the time step
restriction. Furthermore, without enhancing the regularity of the exact
solution or imposing any requirements on the grid ratio, we establish error
estimates of the two proposed schemes in the discrete $H^{1}$ norm. However,
the existing results available in the literature either fail to provide $H^{1}$
error estimates or require certain restrictions on the grid ratio. Numerical
results are reported to confirm our error estimates and demonstrate rich
dynamics of the LogSE.

### [9] [The Bayesian SIAC filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14771)
*Jan Glaubitz,Tongtong Li,Jennifer Ryan,Roman Stuhlmacher*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Bayesian extension of SIAC filter that supports general data models and provides uncertainty quantification, with efficient algorithms for MAP estimation and MCMC sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SIAC filter is limited to nodal data and deterministic point estimates without uncertainty quantification, restricting its applicability.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian extension of SIAC filter with structure-exploiting algorithms for efficient MAP estimation and MCMC sampling, focusing on linear data models with additive Gaussian noise.

Result: Produces point estimates with accuracy comparable to or exceeding deterministic SIAC filter, while supporting general data models and providing built-in uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Bayesian SIAC filter overcomes limitations of deterministic version, broadens applicability, and enables rigorous uncertainty quantification across various applications including signal denoising, image deblurring, and numerical solution post-processing.

Abstract: We propose the Bayesian smoothness-increasing accuracy-conserving (SIAC)
filter -- a hierarchical Bayesian extension of the existing deterministic SIAC
filter. The SIAC filter is a powerful numerical tool for removing
high-frequency noise from data or numerical solutions without degrading
accuracy. However, current SIAC methodology is limited to (i) nodal data
(direct, typically noisy function values) and (ii) deterministic point
estimates that do not account for uncertainty propagation from input data to
the SIAC reconstruction. The proposed Bayesian SIAC filter overcomes these
limitations by (i) supporting general (non-nodal) data models and (ii) enabling
rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ), thereby broadening the applicability
of SIAC filtering. We also develop structure-exploiting algorithms for
efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling, with a focus on linear data models with additive Gaussian
noise. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian
SIAC filter across several applications, including signal denoising, image
deblurring, and post-processing of numerical solutions to hyperbolic
conservation laws. The results show that the Bayesian approach produces point
estimates with accuracy comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of the
deterministic SIAC filter. In addition, it extends naturally to general data
models and provides built-in UQ.

### [10] [A class of flexible and efficient partitioned Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for some time-dependent partial differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14847)
*Xiao Tang,Junwei Huang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods for time-dependent PDEs transformed into ODEs with moderately stiff and non-stiff terms, using flexible s-stage RKC for stiff terms and 4m-stage RK for non-stiff terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many time-dependent PDEs become ODEs with both moderately stiff and non-stiff terms after spatial discretization, requiring efficient numerical methods that can handle both components effectively with flexibility.

Method: Construct partitioned explicit stabilized methods combining s-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) for moderately stiff terms and 4m-stage explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) for non-stiff terms, with both parameters s and m being flexibly adjustable.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate superior flexibility and applicability compared to existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods, as validated through numerical examples including advection-diffusion, Burgers, Brusselator, and damped wave equations.

Conclusion: The new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods offers enhanced flexibility and broad applicability for solving ODEs derived from time-dependent PDEs with mixed stiff/non-stiff characteristics.

Abstract: Many time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) can be transformed
into an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) containing moderately stiff and
non-stiff terms after spatial semi-discretization. In the present paper, we
construct a new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods
for the above ODEs. We treat the moderately stiff term with an s-stage
Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method and treat the non-stiff term with a 4m-stage
explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Different from several existing partitioned
explicit stabilized methods that employ fixed-stage RK methods to handle the
non-stiff term, both the parameters $s$ and $m$ in our methods can be flexibly
adjusted as needed for the problems. This feature endows our methods with
superior flexibility and applicability compared to several existing partitioned
explicit stabilized methods, as demonstrated in several specific numerical
examples (including the advection-diffusion equations, the Burgers equations,
the Brusselator equations and the damped wave equations).

TL;DR: A cell centered Galerkin method combining finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin approaches for miscible displacement in porous media, offering comparable accuracy to higher-order DG methods with only one unknown per cell.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient computational method for miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media that maintains accuracy while reducing computational complexity compared to traditional higher-order discontinuous Galerkin methods.

Method: Cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method that combines finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin concepts, using classical DG weak formulations with only one unknown per cell, and proves inverse-positive matrix properties for Poisson problems in 1D.

Result: The CCG method delivers comparable accuracy and improved efficiency over traditional higher-order interior penalty DG methods, as demonstrated through computational experiments in 2D and 3D for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems.

Conclusion: The CCG method provides an effective lowest-order approximation approach for porous media problems that maintains accuracy while offering computational efficiency advantages over conventional DG methods.

Abstract: In this paper we present a cell centered Galerkin (CCG) method applied to
miscible displacement problems in heterogeneous porous media. The CCG approach
combines concepts from finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to
arrive at an efficient lowest-order approximation (one unknown per cell). We
demonstrate that the CCG method can be defined using classical DG weak
formulations, only requires one unknown per cell, and is able to deliver
comparable accuracy and improved efficiency over traditional higher-order
interior penalty DG methods. In addition, we prove that the CCG method for a
model Poisson problem gives rise to a inverse-positive matrix in 1D. A plethora
of computational experiments in 2D and 3D showcase the effectiveness of the CCG
method for highly heterogeneous flow and transport problems in porous media.
Comparisons between CCG and classical DG methods are included.

### [12] [An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Level-set Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14896)
*Matteo Croci,Abdul-Lateef Haji-Ali,Ian C. J. Powell*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation scheme for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz multivariate functions with noise robustness and improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust numerical method for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz multivariate functions that can handle stochastic noise while maintaining computational efficiency through adaptive refinement.

Method: Combines local function approximation with noise reduction in an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy that automatically refines regions near the level set.

Result: Achieves ε-accurate approximations with expected cost complexity reduction of ε^{-−(αp + 1)/(αp)} compared to non-adaptive schemes, where α is the convergence rate and p relates to noise control in L^p space.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive scheme significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy for level-set approximation in noisy environments, validated through 2D/3D experiments and PDE-based failure region estimation problems.

Abstract: We propose a new numerical scheme for approximating level-sets of Lipschitz
multivariate functions which is robust to stochastic noise. The algorithm's
main feature is an adaptive grid-based stochastic approximation strategy which
automatically refines the approximation over regions close to the level set.
This strategy combines a local function approximation method with a noise
reduction scheme and produces $\varepsilon$-accurate approximations with an
expected cost complexity reduction of $\varepsilon^{-\left(\frac{p+1}{\alpha
p}\right)}$ compared to a non-adaptive scheme, where $\alpha$ is the
convergence rate of the function approximation method and we assume that the
noise can be controlled in $L^p$. We provide numerical experiments in support
of our theoretical findings. These include 2- and 3-dimensional functions with
a complex level set structure, as well as a failure region estimation problem
described by a hyperelasticity partial differential equation with random field
coefficients.

*Clément Cancès,Claire Chainais-Hillairet,Amélie Dupouy*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Study of oxygen concentration evolution in oxide layer using convection-diffusion model with moving boundaries, showing existence of traveling-wave solutions and universal entropy structure, with development of unconditionally convergent numerical scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the evolution of oxygen concentration in oxide layers through mathematical modeling and develop accurate numerical methods that preserve physical properties like traveling waves and energy dissipation.

Method: Transient convection-diffusion equation in 1D variable-width domain with boundary motions governed by concentration traces. Analysis of traveling-wave solutions and entropy structure. Development of implicit ALE finite volume scheme with Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes.

Result: Established necessary/sufficient condition for unique traveling-wave solution existence. Demonstrated universal entropy structure with convex functions dissipating free energy. Numerical scheme preserves traveling waves exactly and dissipates all free energies unconditionally.

Conclusion: The model successfully captures oxide layer evolution physics, with the proposed numerical scheme providing accurate, structure-preserving simulations that converge to traveling-wave solutions and maintain energy dissipation properties.

Abstract: We study a toy model for the evolution of the oxygen concentration in an
oxide layer. It consists in a transient convection diffusion equation in a
one-dimensional domain of variable width. The motions of the boundaries are
governed by the traces of the concentration. We exhibit a necessary and
sufficient condition on the parameters involved in the model for the existence
of a unique traveling-wave solution. Moreover, we show that the model admits
some universal entropy structure, in the sense that any convex function of the
concentration
  yields a dissipated free energy (up to exchanges with the outer environment
at the boundaries). We propose then an implicit in time arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian finite volume scheme based on Scharfetter-Gummel fluxes. It
is shown to be unconditionally convergent, to preserve exactly the travelling
wave, and to dissipate all the aforementioned free energies. Numerical
experiments show that our scheme is first order accurate in time and second
order in space, and that the transient solution converges in the long-time
limit towards the traveling-wave solution.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes late-time instability in marching-on-in-time solutions for the time-domain PMCHWT equation, identifying the static solenoidal nullspace of the electric field integral operator as the main cause.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the stability issues in time-domain PMCHWT equation solutions, particularly the late-time instability that differs from conventional EFIE instability mechanisms.

Method: Stability analysis of marching-on-in-time solutions, focusing on the spectral characteristics and numerical quadrature errors in the context of scatterer surface topology and smoothness.

Result: Identified that PMCHWT instability is fundamentally different from EFIE instability, more sensitive to quadrature errors, and strongly influenced by scatterer surface characteristics.

Conclusion: The time-domain PMCHWT equation has unique instability mechanisms requiring specialized treatment different from traditional EFIE approaches, with surface topology and numerical precision playing critical roles.

Abstract: This paper investigates the late-time instability of marching-on-in-time
solution to the time-domain PMCHWT equation. The stability analysis identifies
the static solenoidal nullspace of the time-domain electric field integral
operator as the primary cause of instability. Furthermore, it reveals that the
instability mechanisms of the time-domain PMCHWT equation are fundamentally
different from those of the time-domain electric field integral equation. In
particular, the PMCHWT's instability is much more sensitive to numerical
quadrature errors, and its spectral characteristics are strongly influenced by
the topology and smoothness of the scatterer surface.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of solving high-order PDEs with complex boundary conditions using PINNs, particularly for biharmonic equations with Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions.

Method: Decomposes high-order biharmonic equations into two Poisson equations, integrates Fourier spectral theory with reduced-order formulation, and uses neural networks to approximate solutions while reducing computational complexity.

Result: FCPINN demonstrates superior performance over conventional PINN and deep mixed residual methods, providing optimal speed-accuracy trade-off and maintaining stability across varying network architectures.

Conclusion: The Fourier heuristic-enhanced approach significantly improves PINN performance for high-order PDEs, making it particularly effective for problems with intricate boundary constraints and high-dimensional inputs.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely utilized for
solving a range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various scientific
and engineering disciplines. This paper presents a Fourier heuristic-enhanced
PINN (termed FCPINN) designed to address a specific class of biharmonic
equations with Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions. The method achieves
this by decomposing the high-order equations into two Poisson equations. FCPINN
integrates Fourier spectral theory with a reduced-order formulation for
high-order PDEs, significantly improving approximation accuracy and reducing
computational complexity. This approach is especially beneficial for problems
with intricate boundary constraints and high-dimensional inputs. To assess the
effectiveness and robustness of the FCPINN algorithm, we conducted several
numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear biharmonic problems across
different Euclidean spaces. The results show that FCPINN provides an optimal
trade-off between speed and accuracy for high-order PDEs, surpassing the
performance of conventional PINN and deep mixed residual method (MIM)
approaches, while also maintaining stability and robustness with varying
numbers of hidden layer nodes.

### [16] [Linear non-divergence elliptic equations in a bounded, infinitely winding planar domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14352)
*Luan Hoang,Akif Ibragimov*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of second order elliptic equations in complex planar domains that wind infinitely around a circle, with results on solution behavior, oscillation estimates, and uniqueness for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how solutions to elliptic equations behave in domains with complicated geometry, particularly those that wind infinitely around a fixed circle, which presents unique mathematical challenges for boundary value problems.

Method: Studied second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in planar domains with complex winding geometry. Analyzed homogeneous equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, examined cases with bounded and unbounded drifts, and investigated inhomogeneous equations with bounded forcing functions.

Result: Proved that solutions exhibit exponential growth or decay behavior as the rotating angle approaches infinity. Obtained oscillation estimates for inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. Showed that even with unbounded drifts (if not growing too fast), solutions converge to zero or infinity. Established solution uniqueness and continuous dependence on boundary data and forcing functions.

Conclusion: The complex winding geometry significantly impacts solution behavior of elliptic equations, leading to exponential growth/decay patterns. The research provides comprehensive understanding of solution properties in such geometrically challenging domains, with implications for mathematical analysis of partial differential equations in non-standard geometries.

Abstract: We study the second order elliptic equations of non-divergence form in a
planar domain with complicated geometry. In this case the domain winds around a
fixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle
goes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of
the solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle
either grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for
the oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for
inhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to
infinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity.
For the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded
forcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and
its continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function.

*Agus L. Soenjaya,Thanh Tran*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for nonlinear stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise on bounded domains, covering various physical systems including fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for analyzing a broad class of nonlinear stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models that appear in various physical applications, providing rigorous mathematical foundations for these complex systems.

Method: Uses Galerkin approximations and compactness arguments, derives strong moment bounds and verifies Cauchy property for approximate solutions, applies Gronwall-type lemma for stochastic processes to establish maximal strong pathwise solutions.

Result: Establishes existence and uniqueness of maximal strong pathwise solutions that are global in two spatial dimensions, providing a unified treatment for various stochastic thermo-magneto-fluid models.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive mathematical framework for analyzing nonlinear stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise, offering rigorous existence and uniqueness results for a wide range of physically relevant systems in fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.

Abstract: We study the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions, in the sense of
PDEs and probability, for a broad class of nonlinear stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs) on a bounded domain $\mathscr{O}\subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\leq 3$), perturbed by spatially correlated multiplicative
noise. Our framework applies to many physically relevant systems, including
stochastic convective Brinkman--Forchheimer equations, stochastic
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), stochastic B\'enard convection in porous media,
stochastic convective dynamo models, and stochastic magneto-micropolar fluids,
among others. The analysis relies on Galerkin approximations and compactness
arguments. Up to a suitable stopping time, we derive strong moment bounds and
verify a Cauchy property for the approximate solutions, in the absence of any
inherent cancellation structure. By applying a Gronwall-type lemma for
stochastic processes, we establish the existence and uniqueness of maximal
strong pathwise solutions, which are global in two spatial dimensions. These
results provide a unified treatment of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic
thermo-magneto-fluid models in the literature.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence and uniqueness of topological solutions to skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs with asymptotic behavior analysis as λ approaches 0 and infinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study topological solutions of the coupled Chern-Simons system on discrete lattice graphs, which has applications in theoretical physics and mathematical physics, particularly in gauge field theories.

Method: Mathematical analysis of the nonlinear system using techniques from partial differential equations and discrete analysis on lattice graphs. The approach involves proving existence, analyzing asymptotic behaviors as λ→0+ and λ→∞, and establishing uniqueness conditions.

Result: Proved existence of topological solutions for any fixed g and h, obtained complete asymptotic behaviors of solutions in both λ→0+ and λ→∞ limits, and established uniqueness when the lattice dimension is large enough or λ is sufficiently large.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of topological solutions to the skew-symmetric Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs, establishing existence, asymptotic properties, and uniqueness under certain conditions, contributing to the understanding of such systems in discrete settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the topological solutions to the skew-symmetric
Chern-Simons system on lattice graphs: $$\left\{\begin{aligned} \Delta u
&=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}(\mathrm{e}^{u}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},
\Delta
\upsilon&=\lambda\mathrm{e}^{u}(\mathrm{e}^{\upsilon}-1)+4\pi\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},
\end{aligned} \right. $$ here, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_+$, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are
two positive integers, $m_j\in\mathbb{N}\, (j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_1)$,
$n_j\in\mathbb{N}\,(j=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot,k_2)$, and $\delta_{p}$ denotes the
Dirac mass at vertex $p$. Write $$g=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j\delta_{p_j},\
h=4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j\delta_{q_j},\ B = 4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_1}m_j +
4\pi\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}n_j.$$ For any fixed $g,h$, we prove the existence of the
topological solutions to the systems, then obtain the asymptotic behaviors of
topological solutions as $\lambda \rightarrow 0_+$ and $\lambda \rightarrow
+\infty$, and finally prove the uniqueness of the topological solutions when
the dimension of lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is large enough or $\lambda$ is
large enough.

TL;DR: Analysis of time discretization and vanishing discount problems for first-order discounted mean field games systems using weak KAM theory, including existence proofs and demonstration of solution non-uniqueness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key issues in first-order discounted mean field games: time discretization for proving solution existence, and vanishing discount problems for both the original and discretized systems.

Method: Time discretization approach combined with weak KAM theory to prove existence of solutions (viscosity solution u and projected minimizing measure m), and analysis of vanishing discount limits.

Result: Proved existence of solutions to the discounted mean field games system and provided an example showing non-uniqueness of solutions.

Conclusion: The time discretization method is effective for establishing solution existence in discounted mean field games, but solutions may not be unique, as demonstrated by the provided counterexample.

Abstract: This article focuses two issues related to the first-order discounted mean
field games system. The first is the time discretization problem. The time
discretization approach enables us to prove the existence of solutions (u,m) of
the system, where u is a viscosity solution of the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi
equation and m is a projected minimizing measure satisfying the continuity
equation in the sense of distributions. The second is the vanishing discount
problems for both the discounted mean field games system and its discretized
system. The methods we use primarily derive from weak KAM theory. Moreover, we
provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of solutions to the
discounted mean field games system.

*Qinfeng Li,Juncheng Wei,Ruofei Yao*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Monotonicity of Robin torsion function in symmetric planar domains when Robin coefficient β ≥ -κ (boundary curvature), with counterexample showing sharpness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish conditions under which the Robin torsion function exhibits monotonicity properties in symmetric planar domains, which has implications for understanding the behavior of solutions to Robin boundary value problems.

Method: Mathematical proof using symmetry arguments and analysis of the Robin boundary condition, combined with construction of a counterexample to demonstrate the sharpness of the condition.

Result: Proved that the Robin torsion function is monotonic in smooth symmetric planar domains when β ≥ -κ, and showed this condition is sharp through a counterexample.

Conclusion: The condition β ≥ -κ is both sufficient and essentially necessary for monotonicity of the Robin torsion function in symmetric planar domains.

Abstract: We prove the monotonicity property of the Robin torsion function in a smooth
planar domain $\Omega$ with a line of symmetry, provided that the Robin
coefficient $\beta$ is greater than or equal to the negative of the boundary
curvature $\kappa$ (i.e., $\beta \geq -\kappa$ on $\partial\Omega$). We also
show that this condition is, in a certain sense, sharp by constructing a
counterexample.

*Jinyuan Shang,Wenting Zhao,Xianjiu Huang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence of normalized solutions for Kirchhoff equations with mixed Choquard nonlinearities in R³, extending previous results to higher exponent ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study normalized solutions (L²-constrained) for Kirchhoff equations with combined nonlocal nonlinearities, generalizing previous work by Wang et al. to cover the critical exponent range 14/3 < q < 6.

Method: Mathematical analysis using energy estimates under L²-constraint, handling two nonlocal terms (Kirchhoff nonlocality and Choquard nonlocality), and employing techniques related to Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.

Result: Proves existence of normalized solutions for the Kirchhoff-Choquard equation with mixed nonlinearities in the specified parameter ranges.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends previous results to higher exponent cases, overcoming challenges from dual nonlocal terms and compactness issues under L² constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of normalized solution to the
following Kirchhoff equation with mixed Choquard type nonlinearities:
\begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\left(a + b \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\nabla u|^2
\, dx\right) \Delta u - \lambda u = \mu |u|^{q-2} u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\alpha +
3}) |u|^{\alpha +1} u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u^2 \,
dx = \rho^2, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $a,b,\rho >0$, $\alpha \in
\left(0, 3\right)$, $\frac{14}{3} < q < 6$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ will
arise as a Lagrange multiplier. The quantity $\alpha + 3$ here represents the
upper critical exponent relevant to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality,
and this exponent can be regarded as equivalent to the Sobolev critical
exponent $2^*$. We generalize the results by Wang et al.(Discrete and
Continuous Dynamical Systems, 2025), which focused on nonlinear Kirchhoff
equations with combined nonlinearities when $2< q< \frac{10}{3}$. The primary
challenge lies in the necessity for subtle energy estimates under the
\(L^2\)-constraint to achieve compactness recovery. Meanwhile, we need to deal
with the difficulties created by the two nonlocal terms appearing in the
equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of nonlinear damped wave equations on weighted graphs, particularly examining conditions under which global solutions fail to exist and determining lifespan estimates for local solutions that blow up in finite time.

Method: Analysis under specific conditions for volume growth of balls and initial data, with application to n-dimensional integer lattice graphs to validate results against known Euclidean setting outcomes.

Result: Proof of nonexistence of global weak solutions under certain conditions, along with lifespan estimates for local weak solutions that experience finite-time blow-up.

Conclusion: The results provide partial confirmation of optimality, particularly through application to Z^n lattice graphs, recovering established results in Euclidean settings and extending them to graph frameworks.

Abstract: In this article, we are interested in studying the Cauchy problems for
nonlinear damped wave equations and their systems on a weighted graph. Our main
purpose is two-fold, namely, under certain conditions for volume growth of a
ball and the initial data we would like to not only prove nonexistence of
global (in time) weak solutions but also indicate lifespan estimates for local
(in time) weak solutions when a blow-up phenomenon in finite time occurs.
Throughout the present paper, we will partially give a positive answer for the
optimality of our results by an application to the $n$-dimensional integer
lattice graph $\Z^n$ to recover the well-known results in the Euclidean
setting.

Motivation: To establish existence and regularity properties for solutions to a class of nonlinear degenerate-elliptic equations that generalize Leray-Lions type equations, particularly when dealing with measurable coefficients and degenerate operators

Method: Proving existence results using nonlinear operators in divergence form associated with vector fields satisfying Poincaré inequality and doubling condition, then establishing L^p-regularity generalizations

Result: Successfully proved existence of solutions and demonstrated that these solutions satisfy generalized L^p-regularity results similar to those known for Leray-Lions type equations

Conclusion: The paper provides important existence and regularity theorems for degenerate-elliptic equations with measurable coefficients, extending known results to more general settings with degenerate operators

Abstract: We prove an existence result for solutions to a class of nonlinear
degenerate-elliptic equations with measurable coefficients and zero Dirichlet
boundary condition. The main term is given by a nonlinear operator in
divergence form associated to a family of vector fields which satisfy a
Poincar\'e inequality and the doubling condition.
  Furthermore, we prove that the solutions satisfy a generalization of the
$L^p$-regularity results which hold for the solutions to Leray-Lions type

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the fundamental open problem of well-posedness for kinetic equations in critical spaces, which is essential for understanding the mathematical foundations of kinetic theory

Method: Develops a new analytical framework with anisotropic norms adapted to scaling invariance, leverages regularizing effects and decomposition of linearized collision operator

Result: Proves local well-posedness near global Maxwellian for small initial perturbations, extends to global solutions with pointwise decay estimates

Conclusion: Resolves a fundamental issue in kinetic theory and provides a new approach applicable to broader classes of kinetic models

Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of the inhomogeneous Boltzmann and
Landau equations in critical function spaces, a fundamental open problem in
kinetic theory. We develop a new analytical framework to establish local
well-posedness near a global Maxwellian for both equations, under the
assumption that the initial perturbation is small in a critical norm. A major
contribution lies in the introduction of a novel anisotropic norm adapted to
the intrinsic scaling invariance of the equations, which provides precise
control over the high-frequency behavior of solutions. By leveraging the
regularizing effect and a decomposition of the linearized collision operator,
we further extend the local solution globally in time and establish pointwise
decay estimates. Our work not only resolves a fundamental issue in the theory
of kinetic equations in critical spaces, but also provides a new approach
applicable to a broader class of kinetic models.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: New monotonicity formula for fractional Laplacian enables localized analysis of L^2-mass preservation in dispersive equations, applied to prove conditional instability of Shrira equation traveling waves without pointwise decay estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust framework for analyzing monotonicity properties of solutions to dispersive equations with fractional dispersion, particularly addressing the challenge of extending monotonicity techniques to higher dimensions and understanding nonlocal dispersion effects.

Method: Employed a new class of pseudo-differential operators to establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional Laplacian |∇ₓ|ᵅ in ℝⁿ (n≥2, α∈[1,2)), enabling localized analysis of L^2-mass preservation and derivation of virial-type estimates.

Result: Proved conditional instability results for traveling wave solutions of the Shrira equation in the critical regime, establishing instability without requiring pointwise decay estimates used in previous works.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible method for extending monotonicity techniques to higher dimensions and reveals the delicate interplay between nonlocal dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

Abstract: By employing a new class of pseudo-differential operators introduced in a
previous work, we establish a novel monotonicity formula for the fractional
Laplacian $|\nabla_x|^\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n \geq 2$ and $\alpha
\in [1,2)$, This framework enables us to localize our analysis to specific
regions of Euclidean space where monotonicity properties of the $L^2$-mass of
solutions to dispersive equations with fractional dispersion are preserved.
  As an application, we focus on the Shrira equation, proving conditional
instability results for its traveling wave solutions in the critical regime. We
deduce key virial-type estimates that govern the long-time behavior of the
$L^2$-mass. As a consequence, we establish instability results without
requiring pointwise decay estimates employed in previous works. Our approach
provides a robust and flexible method for monotonicity techniques to higher
dimensions, shedding light on the delicate interplay between nonlocal
dispersion and spatial localization in nonlinear dispersive models.

*Mitsuo Higaki,Jiajiang Liao,Franck Sueur*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study of Lagrangian controllability for viscous incompressible fluids in perforated domains with small holes, addressing boundary layer challenges through homogenization and stability estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research on Lagrangian controllability for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations hasn't addressed the case with solid boundaries and no-slip conditions due to viscous boundary layer difficulties.

Method: Uses homogenization for evolutionary problems, weak-strong stability estimates, Runge-type approximations for elliptic equations, and Cauchy-Kowalevsky theorems for analytic coefficients.

Result: Develops quantitative framework distinguishing situations based on hole parameters (diameter, distance) and fluid parameters (initial data size).

Conclusion: Provides approach to Lagrangian controllability in perforated domains by connecting Navier-Stokes homogenization to Euler/Darcy equations through vanishing viscosity limit.

Abstract: The question at stake in Lagrangian controllability is whether one can move a
patch of fluid particles to a target location by means of remote action in a
given time interval. In the last two decades, positive results have been
obtained both for the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.
However, for the latter, the case where the fluid is contained within domains
bounded by solid boundaries with the no-slip condition has not been addressed,
with respect to the difficulty caused by viscous boundary layers. In this
paper, we investigate the Lagrangian controllability of viscous incompressible
fluid in perforated domains for which the fraction of volume occupied by the
holes is sufficiently small. Moreover, we quantitatively distinguish situations
depending on the parameters for holes (diameter and distance) and for fluid
(size of the initial data). Our approach relies on recent results on
homogenization for evolutionary problems and on weak-strong stability estimates
in measure of flows, alongside classical results on Runge-type approximations
for elliptic equations and on Cauchy-Kowalevsky-type theorems for equations
with analytic coefficients. Here, homogenization refers to the vanishing
viscosity limit outside a porous medium, where (after scaling in time) the
Navier-Stokes equations are homogenized to the Euler or Darcy equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities and damaged subvolumes in elastic materials with complex interfaces.

Method: Adapt the factorization method to handle higher-order boundary operators and their nontrivial null spaces, using displacement-stress measurements on exterior boundary through Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.

Result: Shows uniqueness in recovering shear parameters, interface parameters, and inclusion shape. Numerical experiments demonstrate feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides a viable method for detecting interior inhomogeneities in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces, potentially useful for nondestructive evaluation applications.

Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic
bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic
elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with
higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the
exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we
show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well
as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt
the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the
higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical
experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the
framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of
interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.

*Allen H Boozer*

TL;DR: Electron inertia enables magnetic reconnection without other non-ideal effects, with a modified field evolving ideally while particle trajectories remain largely unaffected except in thin current sheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how finite electron mass alone can cause magnetic reconnection and identify a related magnetic field that evolves ideally despite electron inertia effects.

Method: Analysis of magnetic field evolution with electron inertia as the only non-ideal effect, introducing a modified field β = B + ∇×((m_e/ne²)j) that evolves ideally, and examining its relationship to Voigt normalized magnetic field.

Result: Electron inertia enables magnetic reconnection without other non-ideal mechanisms. The field β evolves ideally while B does not. Particle trajectories are minimally affected except in thin current sheets where currents become extremely large.

Conclusion: Finite electron mass provides a fundamental mechanism for magnetic reconnection through electron inertia effects, with the modified field β offering an ideal evolution framework while preserving most particle trajectory characteristics.

Abstract: The finite electron mass can cause magnetic reconnection even in the absence
of any other non-ideal effect in a magnetic evolution. It will be shown that
when electron inertia is the only non-ideal effect in the evolution of the
magnetic field $\vec{B}$, there is a related field that evolves ideally. This
field is $\vec{\mathcal{B}} \equiv \vec{B} + \vec{\nabla}\times \left( (m_e/n
e^2) \vec{j} \right)$ with $m_e$ the electron mass, $n$ the electron number
density, and $\vec{j}$ the current density. Although the magnetic field is
modified from its ideal evolution form by the electron inertia, the effect on
particle trajectories, even electron trajectories, is small unless the current
lies in thin sheets, which make $\vec{j}$ extremely large. The field
$\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ is closely related to Voigt normalized magnetic field,
which is defined by a Laplacian smoothing of $\vec{B}$. The difference between
$\vec{\mathcal{B}}$ and $\vec{B}$ involves the relativistically invariant
four-space Laplacian acting on $\vec{B}$ with a $c/\omega_{pe}$ smoothing
distance; $\omega_{pe}$ is the plasma frequency.

TL;DR: Non-intrusive PBDW method for 3D cardiac displacement field reconstruction from sparse MRI data with enhanced computational efficiency and memory optimization, achieving high accuracy and significant speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate myocardial displacement reconstruction from sparse clinical imaging, but current methods demand intrusive access to computational models.

Method: Applied non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach using only solution snapshots, introduced H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for efficient sensor selection, and memory optimization techniques for vectorial problems.

Result: Exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (O(1e-2)), effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (O(1e-2)), and 4-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full FE simulations.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates significant potential for clinical integration with fast reconstruction times (under 0.1s) and immediate deployment across commercial/research codes without requiring governing equations or solver access.

Abstract: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of
myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current
methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we
apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to
three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited
Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires
only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver
access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes
using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two
enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP)
algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while
maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques
exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model
with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we
systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking
realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in
noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance
with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective
reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)).
The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational
speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction
times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant
potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand electromagnetic properties of discrete metamaterials and challenge the common belief that large samples behave like uniform homogenized materials.

Method: Developed an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response in samples containing several million meta-atoms, comparing results with discrete dipole approximation and continuous particle integral models.

Result: Even million-atom samples with sharp edges remain distinct from uniform materials and show critical sensitivity to shape and boundary structure. Discrete metamaterials serve as a stringent test for continuous models.

Conclusion: The findings are important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements and demonstrate that discrete structure effects persist even in large metamaterial samples.

Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial
samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic
array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical
procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to
analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that,
contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges
are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their
properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We
also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole
approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and
analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In
particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform
for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges.
Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic

*Hai Siong Tan,Kuancheng Wang,Rafe McBeth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E-PINN is a novel uncertainty-aware Physics-Informed Neural Network that uses evidential deep learning for uncertainty estimation and parameter inference, outperforming Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods in calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more reliable uncertainty-aware PINN framework that can better estimate output uncertainties and infer unknown PDE parameters through posterior distributions, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Leverages marginal distribution loss function from evidential deep learning for uncertainty estimation, infers unknown PDE parameters via learned posterior distribution, validated on 1D Poisson equation and 2D Fisher-KPP equation.

Result: E-PINN generated significantly better calibrated empirical coverage probabilities compared to Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods, and demonstrated real-world applicability in clinical glucose-insulin dataset analysis.

Conclusion: E-PINN represents an effective uncertainty-aware framework that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and practical applicability to real-world problems, particularly in medical research contexts.

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying
Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of
uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of
evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers
unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating
our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a
Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated
empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than
Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world
applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze
clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on
diabetes pathophysiology.

*Nishantak Panigrahi,Mayank Patwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNNs for approximating nonlocal conservation law solutions from Kuramoto model, showing tanh activation provides stable convergence while sine can achieve lower errors but may produce artifacts. Identifies limitations in handling sharp features due to activation function constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks for solving nonlocal conservation laws derived from the Kuramoto model, and evaluate how architectural choices impact solution accuracy and computational performance compared to traditional methods.

Method: Systematic experimentation with different network configurations: activation functions (tanh, sin, ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width (64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch count). Comparative analysis with traditional numerical methods.

Result: Tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, while sine activation can achieve marginally lower errors and training times in some cases but may produce nonphysical artifacts. Optimally configured DNNs offer competitive accuracy with different computational trade-offs compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The work provides empirical guidelines for DNN implementation in scientific computing while revealing fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward architectures in handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions due to activation function constraints that cause oversmoothing of sharp features.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
to approximate the solution of a nonlocal conservation law derived from the
identical-oscillator Kuramoto model, focusing on the evaluation of an
architectural choice and its impact on solution accuracy based on the energy
norm and computation time. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate
that network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function
selection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width
(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch
count)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that
tanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine
activation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated
cases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis
with traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer
competitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.
Furthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward
architectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing
empirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due
to the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.
This work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based
scientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for
DNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that
must be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical
systems with discontinuities.

### [35] [Efficient Computation of Time-Index Powered Weighted Sums Using Cascaded Accumulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15069)
*Deijany Rodriguez Linares,Oksana Moryakova,Håkan Johansson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel method for efficiently computing time-index powered weighted sums using cascaded accumulators, reducing computational cost from K×N to K+1 multiplications without requiring data storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computation of time-index powered weighted sums requires K×N multiplications which becomes prohibitive for large N, and alternative methods need to store entire data blocks, making real-time implementation challenging.

Method: The proposed approach uses cascaded accumulators to exploit accumulator properties, eliminating the need for data storage and reducing the multiplicative operations to only K+1 constant multiplications.

Result: The method enables efficient computation of sums in the form ∑_{n=0}^{N-1} n^K v[n] with significantly reduced computational complexity and no storage requirements compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This cascaded accumulator approach provides an efficient solution for real-time implementation of time-index powered weighted sums in sample-by-sample processing systems, overcoming the limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel approach for \mbox{efficiently} computing
time-index powered weighted sums of the form $\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} n^{K} v[n]$
using cascaded accumulators. Traditional direct computation requires
$K{\times}N$ general multiplications, which become prohibitive for large $N$,
while alternative strategies based on lookup tables or signal reversal require
storing entire data blocks. By exploiting accumulator properties, the proposed
method eliminates the need for such storage and reduces the multiplicative cost
to only $K{+}1$ constant multiplications, enabling efficient real-time
implementation. The approach is particularly useful when such sums need to be
efficiently computed in sample-by-sample processing systems.

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis of 54 Schelling model rule variants reveals only 3 distinct phase diagram classes based on number of phase transitions, with robust classification across different segregation measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically classify and understand the macroscopic outcomes of various Schelling model rule variants, which serve as prototypes for agent-based social system modeling.

Method: Classification of phase diagrams for 54 different rule variants, analyzing statistical and dynamic drivers including vision, movement criteria, vacancies, initial state, and rivalry. Used both sociological and percolation-inspired segregation measures.

Result: Only 3 distinct phase diagram classes were identified, characterized by the number of phase transitions. Schelling's original step function was found to be pathological at high thresholds, causing coordination failures. The classification scheme proved robust across different segregation measurement approaches.

Conclusion: This comprehensive classification provides new insights into transition drivers in the Schelling model and establishes a foundation for studying more complex Schelling-like models in social systems.

Abstract: The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social
systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved
by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams.
Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized
by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be
robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of
segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are
elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the
initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating
satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing
coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This
comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions
in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex
Schelling-like models.

*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reanalysis of a three-loop spatial linkage showing it has finite DOF 3 (overconstrained) but differential DOF 5 in reference configuration, with smooth manifold c-space and constant differential DOF indicating shakiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and provide deeper analysis of a previously studied three-loop spatial linkage to understand its kinematic properties, particularly the discrepancy between finite and differential degrees of freedom.

Method: Local analysis using kinematic tangent cone computation and local approximation of configuration space to examine the linkage's properties around its reference configuration.

Result: The linkage has finite DOF 3 (overconstrained) but differential DOF 5 in reference configuration. The configuration space is locally a smooth manifold, making the reference configuration not a singularity. The constant differential DOF indicates the linkage is shaky.

Conclusion: The three-loop spatial linkage exhibits shakiness with constant differential DOF, and the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity despite the DOF discrepancy, providing new insights into its kinematic behavior.

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

*Takehiro Fujii,Takeshi Omori*

TL;DR: A new immersed boundary method for simulating incompressible flow over bodies with surface slip, using implicit projection to determine slip velocity and boundary forces while maintaining divergence-free velocity field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional continuous forcing approaches in accurately evaluating velocity gradients on boundaries for flows with surface slip described by Navier boundary conditions.

Method: Implicit projection approach that simultaneously determines wall slip velocity and boundary force to satisfy boundary conditions and divergence-free constraint. The method achieves first-order spatial accuracy and fourth-order temporal accuracy.

Result: Simulations of flow past stationary and moving circular cylinders show good agreement with previous experimental and numerical results across a wide range of slip lengths, including no-slip cases.

Conclusion: The presented immersed boundary method successfully handles surface slip conditions while maintaining accuracy, overcoming previous difficulties with velocity gradient evaluation on boundaries.

Abstract: A formulation of the immersed boundary method for incompressible flow over
bodies with surface slip described by the Navier boundary condition is
presented. In the present method, the wall slip velocity and the boundary force
are determined implicitly through a projection to satisfy the boundary
conditions and the divergence-free condition of the velocity field as
constraints. The present method is first-order accurate in space and
fourth-order accurate in time, overcoming the difficulty of the conventional
continuous forcing approaches to accurately evaluate the velocity gradient on
the boundary. Results from the simulation of the flow past stationary and
moving circular cylinders are in good agreement with previous experimental and
numerical results for a wide range of slip length on the surface, including the
no-slip case.

*Yagyank Srivastava,Amey G. Gokhale,Ankit Jain*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Analysis of computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity predictions using different Boltzmann Transport Equation solvers, DFT packages, exchange-correlation functionals, and machine learning forcefields across 50 semiconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and compare the uncertainties introduced by different computational methods and tools in predicting lattice thermal conductivity, which is crucial for materials screening and design.

Method: Used three BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, in-house code) with interatomic forces from DFT packages (Quantum Espresso, VASP) employing various exchange-correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, rSCAN) and pre-trained machine learning forcefields on different material datasets.

Result: BTE solvers showed minimal uncertainty (1% MAPE), DFT packages caused ~10% error, exchange-correlation functionals introduced large differences (>20% MAPE), and ML models predicted correct trends but with high errors.

Conclusion: While BTE solvers and DFT packages show good agreement, choice of exchange-correlation functional significantly impacts results, and current ML models need improvement for reliable materials screening applications.

Abstract: We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation
(BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse
semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and
in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained
either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages
Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation
functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational
machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
  We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and,
using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent
agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only
1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT
packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of
stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in
thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation
functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available
pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal
conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications
for coarse screening of materials.

TL;DR: Theoretical study using Landauer approach to analyze how oxygen impurities and vacancies affect thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride nanostructures, explaining experimental results and proposing strategies for efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the microscopic origins of thermoelectric efficiency in transition-metal nitrides, particularly scandium nitride, and explain experimental observations of fabrication-dependent thermoelectric properties.

Method: Used Landauer approach to model electronic and structural modifications from oxygen impurities and spatial vacancies in ScN nanostructures, relating these to electronic transport properties.

Result: Found that thermoelectric properties of ScN are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors from defects/impurities, providing theoretical interpretation of experimental fabrication-dependent results.

Conclusion: This theoretical approach shows potential for studying thermoelectricity and uncovering strategies to improve thermoelectric efficiency in materials like ScN.

Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential
applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach
to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of
scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of
electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and
spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking
advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical
interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of
the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during
fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by
structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our
findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying
thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric
efficiency.

*Zhaobo Zhou,Sangeeta Sharma,Junjie He*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Laser-induced demagnetization in g-wave altermagnet CrSb shows direction-dependent behavior - normal incidence preserves zero net magnetization while off-normal incidence creates transient ferrimagnetic-like state with net magnetization, due to anisotropic optical intersite spin transfer from nodal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets affect light-induced spin responses, particularly the direction-dependent ultrafast demagnetization dynamics that remain poorly understood.

Method: Used time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to study laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in g-wave altermagnet CrSb, comparing different laser incidence directions and polarization alignments.

Result: Normal incidence along [0001] axis produces symmetric demagnetization with different amplitudes but preserves net-zero magnetization. Off-normal incidence induces asymmetric demagnetization, creating transient ferrimagnetic-like state with sizable net magnetization due to anisotropic OISTR from nodal structures.

Conclusion: Light-induced magnetization occurs when laser polarization aligns with spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures, which can be determined from local spin density of states along specific band paths, providing fundamental understanding of ultrafast dynamics in altermagnets.

Abstract: The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause
distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced
ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed
by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis,
two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with
different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the
behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced
asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system
into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This
direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in
bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite
spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that
light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with
spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily
determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our
results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast
dynamics in AM.

TL;DR: A framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold parametrized by processing conditions, treating microstructure as a stochastic process distribution rather than single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerate materials development by creating quantitative linkages between processing, microstructure, and properties through low-dimensional material manifolds.

Method: Treat microstructure as stochastic process distributions, compare multiple descriptors (two-point statistics, chord-length distributions, persistent homology) using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition, evaluate dimensionality and invertibility.

Result: Distribution-based descriptors recover two-dimensional latent structure aligned with true processing parameters, creating invertible and interpretable mapping. Non-variability-aware descriptors overestimate dimensionality or lose fidelity.

Conclusion: The material manifold approach provides quantitative foundation for microstructure-informed process design and enables closed-loop optimization of processing-structure-property relationships.

Abstract: Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between
processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a
framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold
that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating
microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of
microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction
of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent
features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural
outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few
parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model
material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point
statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of
two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)
invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate
that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent
structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible
and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In
contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either
overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed
material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in
process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors.
This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation
for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop
optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated
materials engineering context.

Method: Prove sharp lower bound by bounding the gap below by corresponding one-dimensional Schrödinger operator gap, show monotonicity of normalized gap with diameter

Result: Fundamental gap is bounded below by one-dimensional model gap, normalized gap increases monotonically with diameter, estimate is sharp

Conclusion: Successfully extends previous seminal results to Gaussian space setting, confirming the Gaussian fundamental gap conjecture with sharp bounds

Abstract: We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap of convex domains in

establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of a corresponding

prove the sharpness of our estimate. This work extends the seminal results of
Andrews and Clutterbuck for Euclidean domains and Seto, Wang and Wei for
spherical domains to the fundamentally important setting of Gaussian spaces.

TL;DR: A fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm for bone segmentation that addresses edge obstruction, leakage, and fracture handling using orthopedic knowledge-inspired edge detection and adaptive step size with fracture prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geodesic active contour models struggle with indiscriminate feature extraction, edge obstruction, edge leakage, and bone fracture handling in bone segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposed a novel edge-detector function combining intensity and gradient norm to guide contours toward bone edges without soft tissue obstruction. Introduced distance information with embedded fracture prompts as adaptive step size to stabilize contour evolution and improve fracture region accuracy.

Result: Experiments on pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrated effective handling of edge obstruction, leakage, and fracture problems with accurate, stable, and consistent performance.

Conclusion: The algorithm shows broader application potential in other bone anatomies and provides insights for combining domain knowledge with deep neural networks.

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

TL;DR: Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering weighted point sources in heat equations from boundary flux data using level set representation and Poisson point process thinning


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of constructing suitable priors for highly structured unknowns in classical Bayesian framework for point source recovery

Method: Combines level set representation on discretized mesh with marked Poisson point process modeling and thinning mechanism to generate and refine candidate point sources

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate accurate reconstruction of point sources

Conclusion: The combined Bayesian level set sampling and thinning framework effectively recovers weighted point source functions from boundary flux observations

Abstract: In this work, we propose a Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering
weighted point source functions in the heat equation from boundary flux
observations. The major challenge in the classical Bayesian framework lies in
constructing suitable priors for such highly structured unknowns. To address
this, we introduce a level set representation on a discretized mesh for the
unknown, which enables the infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework to the
reconstruction. From another perspective, the point source configuration can be
modeled as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), then a thinning mechanism is
employed to selectively retain points. These two proposals are complementary
with the Bayesian level set sampling generating candidate point sources and the
thinning process acting as a filter to refine them. This combined framework is
validated through numerical experiments, which demonstrate its accuracy in
reconstructing point sources.
