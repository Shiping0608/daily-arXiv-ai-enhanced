Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can\nbe embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size\nto stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and\nfractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and\nimproves the accuracy in the fracture regions.
