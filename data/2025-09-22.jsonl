For more than 80 years since its\nintroduction, the response spectrum has remained the cornerstone of every\nseismic design code. The second-order differential equation that governs the\ndynamic response of a linear elastic SDOF system must be solved numerically to\ngenerate such response spectra. Although only one or two well-accepted\ntime-discretization methods have been predominantly used by the earthquake\nengineering community over the past decades, these methods are directly or\nindirectly related to a broader family of methods for solving Linear\nTime-Invariant (LTI) systems, which have been extensively applied in other\nbranches of engineering, particularly electrical engineering. It has recently\ncome to my attention that a portion of our community, particularly students,\nmay not be fully familiar with these methods. In this paper, I review these\nmethods and describe their mathematical background, with a focus on the\nrelative displacement of the SDOF system under ground acceleration-an essential\nquantity for various types of response spectra. I also briefly review some of\nthe numerical methods traditionally used within our community, highlighting\ntheir similarities and differences. I evaluate the accuracy of all numerical\nmethods introduced in this paper through several examples with available\nanalytical solutions. This study focuses on time-domain solutions that can be\nemployed for real- or near-real-time response prediction, which is particularly\nimportant for applications such as earthquake early warning and post-earthquake\nassessment. The paper is written to enable readers to implement these methods\nwith minimal effort; however, MATLAB codes for all methods discussed are also\nprovided."}

These emissions were primarily\nattributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm\nthe role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such\nBalmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He\nmetastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the\nvacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange\nbetween metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism.\nSince the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O\nmolecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H\nions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma,\nemitting the Balmer series.

Along its path, the sensor continuously takes\nmeasurements of the state, which is a physical quantity modeled as the solution\nof a partial differential equation (PDE) with uncertain parameters. Considering\nlinear PDEs specifically, we derive the closed-form expression of the posterior\ncovariance matrix of the model parameters as a function of the path, and\nformulate the optimal experimental design problem for minimizing the\nposterior's uncertainty. We discretize the problem such that the cost function\nremains consistent under temporal refinement. Additional constraints ensure\nthat the path avoids obstacles and remains physically interpretable through a\ncontrol parameterization. The constrained optimization problem is solved using\nan interior-point method. We present computational results for a\nconvection-diffusion equation with unknown initial condition."}

This is achieved through the use of\ntime-dependent transformations -- what can be viewed as dynamic pinning\nconditions -- that render the symmetry-invariant solution stationary or slowly\nvarying in rescaled coordinates. The transformation process yields a modified\nevolution equation coupled with algebraic constraints on the symmetry\nparameters, resulting in index-2 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems.\nThe framework accommodates both first-kind and second-kind self-similarity, and\ndirectly recovers the self-similarity exponents or wave speeds as part of the\nsolution, upon considering steady-state solutions in the rescaled coordinate\nframe. To solve the resulting high-index DAE systems, we employ\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which naturally integrate PDE\nresiduals and algebraic constraints into a unified loss function. This allows\nsimultaneous inference of both the invariant solution and the transformation\nproperties (such as the speed or the scaling rate without the need for large\ncomputational domains, mesh adaptivity, or front tracking. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the method on four canonical problems: (i) the Nagumo equation\nexhibiting traveling waves, (ii) the diffusion equation (1D and 2D) with\nfirst-kind self-similarity, (iii) the 2D axisymmetric porous medium equation\nshowcasing second-kind self-similarity, and (iv) the Burgers equation, which\ninvolves both translational and scaling invariance. The results demonstrate the\ncapability of PINNs to effectively solve these complex PDE-DAE systems,\nproviding a promising tool for studying nonlinear wave and scaling phenomena."}
