In many situations the use of\nfractional diffusion models has been found to be more faithful to that which is\nobserved. Specifically, we replace the Laplacian operator in the PDE by a\nfractional Laplacian operator ${\\mathcal L}$ which is an integral operator for\nwhich solutions are sought for on all of space, has an unbounded domain of\nintegration, and for a given point $x$ the integrand contains a kernel function\n$\\phi(y-x)$ that is infinite whenever $y=x$.\n  These three features pose impediments not only for the construction of\nefficient discretization methods but also because all three involve one or more\nsort of \"infinity''. To overcome these impediments we choose to invoke one or\nmore of the following strategies. (a) We seek solutions only within a chosen\nbounded domain $\\Omega$.

We\nfirst evaluate both models in a laminar cylinder wake flow at a Reynolds number\nof $Re = 800$ as a proof-of-concept. The results show that the T2F model\nachieves velocity reconstruction accuracy comparable to existing flow\nreconstruction methods, while the T2F+PINN model reduces the normalized error\nin vorticity reconstruction relative to the T2F model. We then apply the models\nin a turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection at a Rayleigh number of $Ra =\n10^{8}$ and a Prandtl number of $Pr = 0.71$. The results show that the T2F\nmodel accurately reconstructs both the velocity and temperature fields, whereas\nthe T2F+PINN model further improves the reconstruction accuracy of\ngradient-related physical quantities, such as temperature gradients, vorticity,\nand the $Q$ value, with a maximum improvement of approximately 60\\% compared to\nthe T2F model. Overall, the T2F model is better suited for reconstructing\nprimitive flow variables, while the T2F+PINN model provides advantages in\nreconstructing gradient-related quantities.

This map serves as a mathematical justification for slender\nbody theories wherein such 3D-1D couplings play a central role. We develop a\nsolution theory for the filament evolution under this coupling. Our analysis\nrelies on two main ingredients: (1) an extraction of the principal symbol of\nthe slender body NtD map, from the author's previous work, and (2) a detailed\ntreatment of the tension determination problem for enforcing the\ninextensibility constraint. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for\nvarious computational models in which a slender filament evolves according to a\n1D elasticity law in a 3D fluid. This forms a key development in our broader\nprogram to place slender body theories on firm theoretical footing."}

In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the\nstability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter\nregimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016))\nobservations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found\nthat observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI\nrequires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron\ndistributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we\ninvestigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain\nthe observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\\kappa$ ) and\ncore-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical\nstudies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter\nregime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated\nagainst kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the\npresence of $\\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not\nsignificantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature\nfor an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975)\nis confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify\nstability assessment of future observations."}

However, in this paper, we introduce a definition of weak\nsolutions for the boundary problem on uniform domain. What is interesting is\nthat this definition can be considered to analysis the regularity of weak\nsolutions. In particular, by establishing the energy inequality, we show the\nboundary pointwise $C^\\alpha$ regularity by using compactness methods under the\nadmissible condition. Furthermore, by establishing the linear property of\nsolutions with respective to the harmonic functions, we also prove the boundary\npointwise $C^{1,\\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\\alpha}$ regularities if the boundary data\nand the boundary of domain are pointwise $C^{1,\\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\\alpha }$\nrespectively."}

The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable\nconfigurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of\nmultiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at\nlarger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and\nnear-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant\nspatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density\nfield -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell --\nis used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly\noscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are\nmuch larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling.\n  In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the\ncharge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of\nproblems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the\ncontinuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much\nsmaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing.\nThese limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms\nof the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate\nboundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further,\nwe demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of\npolarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total\nelectrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding\nenergy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined."}

In 2D, an important physical effect associated with this system is the\nfamous Kutta-Joukowski effect. In the present paper, we identify a similar\neffect in the 3D case. For this, we first recast the Newtonian dynamics of the\nrigid body as a first-order nonlinear ODE for the $6$-component body velocity,\nin the body frame. Then, we focus on the particular case where the rigid body\noccupies a slender tubular domain with a smooth closed curve as the centerline\nand a circular cross-section, in the limit where the radius goes to zero, with\nfixed inertia and circulation around the curve. We establish that the dynamics\nof the limit massive rigid loop are given by a first-order nonlinear ODE with\ncoefficients that depend only on the inertia, on the fluid vorticity, and on\nthe limit curve through two $3$D vectors, which are involved in a skewsymmetric\n$6 \\times 6$ matrix that appears in the limit force and torque, a structure\nwhich is reminiscent of the 2D Kutta-Joukowski effect. We also identify the\nlimit fluid dynamics as, where, as in the case of the Euler equation alone, the\nvorticity evolves according to the usual transport equation with stretching,\nbut with a velocity field that is due not only to the fluid vorticity but also\nto a vorticity filament associated with the circulation around the limit rigid\nloop. This result is in stark contrast with the case where the filament is made\nof fluid, with non-zero circulation, since in the latter, the filament velocity\nbecomes infinite in the zero-radius limit. However, considering the inertia\nscaling that corresponds to a fixed density, we prove that there are solutions\nfor which the solid velocity and its displacement tend to infinity over a time\ninterval of size $\\mathcal{O}(1)$."}
