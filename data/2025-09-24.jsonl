The low-rank assumption is key in establishing\na relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The\nlow-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical\noptimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly\n(in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization\napproach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study\nprobabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform\nobservations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern\nexhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient\nalgorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging\nthis structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra\noperations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of\n``fiber-wise\" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a\nsingle specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the\nusual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is\nrelevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a\nspecific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is\nguaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation\npattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications\nand use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

The fibers are selected based on the discrete empirical\ninterpolation method (DEIM). Cross$^2$-DEIM resemblances the Fiber Sampling\nTucker Decomposition (FSTD)2 approximation, and has favorable computational\nscaling compared to existing methods in the literature. We demonstrate good\nperformance of Cross$^2$-DEIM in terms of iteration count and intermediate\nmemory. First we design a fast direct Poisson solver based on Cross$^2$-DEIM\nand the fast Fourier transform. This solver can be used as a stand alone or as\na preconditioner for low-rank solvers for elliptic problems.\n  The second method is a low-rank solver for nonlinear tensor equation in\nTucker format by Anderson acceleration (AA), which we call Tucker-AA. Tucker-AA\nis an extension of low-rank AA (lrAA) proposed in our prior work for low-rank\nsolution to nonlinear matrix equation. We apply Cross$^2$-DEIM with warm-start\nin Tucker-AA to deal with the nonlinearity in the equation.

Yet\nconvergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments\nusually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix\ninversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,\nbut its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;\nmanual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending\nMCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts\npreconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition\nfunction then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On\na previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better\npreconditioning with 50\\% of the search budget of conventional methods,\nyielding about a 10\\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results\nsuggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale\nsystems."}
