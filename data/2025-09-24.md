### [1] [Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149)
*Shakir Showkat Sofi,Lieven De Lathauwer*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a fast tensor completion method using tensor train decomposition for fiber-wise observed tensors, where entire fibers along a specific mode are either fully observed or missing, with deterministic recovery guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor completion methods rely on probabilistic guarantees under random uniform observations, but when observation patterns have exploitable low-rank structure, more efficient deterministic algorithms can be designed. This is particularly relevant when data collection is easier along specific modes (e.g., temporal).

Method: The method uses standard linear algebra operations to compute tensor train decomposition for fiber-wise observed tensors, where fibers along a single mode are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike traditional entry-wise observations.

Result: The proposed completion method is fast and guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness through various applications and use cases.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient deterministic alternative to probabilistic tensor completion methods by exploiting structured observation patterns, particularly useful when data collection is mode-specific, with practical applications demonstrated through experiments.

Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a
multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations)
and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing
a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The
low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical
optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly
(in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization
approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study
probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform
observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern
exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient
algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging
this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra
operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of
``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a
single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the
usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is
relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a
specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is
guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation
pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications
and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [2] [A mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18348)
*Juan Pablo Borthagaray,Nahuel de León*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a stabilized mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem using fractional calculus identities, establishing well-posedness and developing a conforming finite element discretization with proven convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical Poisson problem's mixed formulation introduces flux as an additional variable, but a direct discretization of the fractional Poisson problem's mixed formulation appears infeasible, requiring a stabilized approach.

Method: The authors adapt Hughes and Masud's stabilized approach to create a coercive and well-posed mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem using fractional calculus identities, then develop a conforming finite element discretization.

Result: The stabilized formulation ensures coercivity and well-posedness, guaranteeing stability for any conforming finite element discretization. Convergence is proven with derived convergence rates, and numerical experiments validate the importance of stabilization and theoretical accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed stabilized mixed formulation successfully addresses the fractional Poisson problem, providing a stable and convergent numerical framework with practical implementation aspects and experimental validation.

Abstract: The mixed formulation of the classical Poisson problem introduces the flux as
an additional variable, leading to a system of coupled equations. Using
fractional calculus identities, in this work we explore a mixed formulation of
the fractional Poisson problem and establish its well-posedness. Since a direct
discretization of this problem appears to be out of reach, we adapt a
stabilized approach by Hughes and Masud, which yields a coercive and well-posed
formulation. The coercivity ensures the stability of any conforming finite
element discretization. We further prove the convergence of this
discretization, derive convergence rates, and discuss implementation aspects.
Finally, we present numerical experiments that highlight both the importance of
stabilization and the accuracy of our theoretical results.

### [3] [ff-bifbox: A scalable, open-source toolbox for bifurcation analysis of nonlinear PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18429)
*Christopher M. Douglas,Pierre Jolivet*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: ff-bifbox is a new open-source toolbox for numerical analysis of large nonlinear PDEs on adaptively refined meshes, enabling branch tracing, stability analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration in 2D and 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear PDEs present challenges due to large degrees of freedom, ill-conditioned operators, and varying spatial/parameter resolution requirements, necessitating specialized computational tools.

Method: Uses finite element discretization via FreeFEM with distributed operator manipulation through PETSc, providing capabilities for branch tracing, bifurcation analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration on adaptive meshes.

Result: Validated implementation through three examples (3D Brusselator, 3D plate buckling, 2D compressible Navier-Stokes), reproducing prior results and presenting novel findings for each system.

Conclusion: ff-bifbox successfully addresses computational challenges of nonlinear PDE analysis and provides a robust open-source framework with runnable code examples for complex systems.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDEs give rise to complex dynamics that are often difficult to
analyze in state space due to their relatively large numbers of degrees of
freedom, ill-conditioned operators, and changing spatial and parameter
resolution requirements. This work introduces ff-bifbox: a new open-source
toolbox for performing numerical branch tracing, stability/bifurcation
analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration of large, time-dependent
nonlinear PDEs discretized on adaptively refined meshes in two and three
spatial dimensions. Spatial discretization is handled using finite elements in
FreeFEM, with the discretized operators manipulated in a distributed framework
via PETSc. Following a summary of the underlying theory and numerics, results
from three examples are presented to validate the implementation and
demonstrate its capabilities. The considered examples, which are provided with
runnable ff-bifbox code, include: a 3-D Brusselator system, a 3-D plate
buckling system, and a 2-D compressible Navier--Stokes system. In addition to
reproducing results from prior studies, novel results are presented for each
system.

### [4] [A new cross approximation for Tucker tensors and its application in Tucker-Anderson Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18554)
*Daniel Appelö,Yingda Cheng*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new algorithms for Tucker tensor format: Cross²-DEIM for tensor approximation and Tucker-AA for solving nonlinear tensor equations using Anderson acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient computational methods for tensor operations that have favorable scaling and performance compared to existing methods, particularly for solving PDEs in 3D.

Method: Cross²-DEIM uses iterative fiber sampling based on DEIM with O(r) fibers per mode. Tucker-AA extends low-rank Anderson acceleration to Tucker format, using Cross²-DEIM for nonlinearity handling and rank control strategies.

Result: The methods demonstrate good performance in iteration count and memory usage. Cross²-DEIM enables fast Poisson solvers, and Tucker-AA effectively solves nonlinear PDEs in 3D with controlled rank growth.

Conclusion: Both Cross²-DEIM and Tucker-AA provide efficient computational frameworks for tensor operations, offering improved scaling and performance for tensor approximation and nonlinear PDE solving.

Abstract: This paper proposes two new algorithms related to the Tucker tensor format.
The first method is a new cross approximation for Tucker tensors, which we call
Cross$^2$-DEIM. Cross$^2$-DEIM is an iterative method that uses a fiber
sampling strategy, sampling $O(r)$ fibers in each mode, where $r$ denotes the
target rank. The fibers are selected based on the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM). Cross$^2$-DEIM resemblances the Fiber Sampling
Tucker Decomposition (FSTD)2 approximation, and has favorable computational
scaling compared to existing methods in the literature. We demonstrate good
performance of Cross$^2$-DEIM in terms of iteration count and intermediate
memory. First we design a fast direct Poisson solver based on Cross$^2$-DEIM
and the fast Fourier transform. This solver can be used as a stand alone or as
a preconditioner for low-rank solvers for elliptic problems.
  The second method is a low-rank solver for nonlinear tensor equation in
Tucker format by Anderson acceleration (AA), which we call Tucker-AA. Tucker-AA
is an extension of low-rank AA (lrAA) proposed in our prior work for low-rank
solution to nonlinear matrix equation. We apply Cross$^2$-DEIM with warm-start
in Tucker-AA to deal with the nonlinearity in the equation. We apply low-rank
operations in AA, and by an appropriate rank truncation strategy, we are able
to control the intermediate rank growth. We demonstrated the performance for
Tucker-AA for approximate solutions nonlinear PDEs in 3D.

### [5] [Skew Gradient Embedding for Thermodynamically Consistent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18601)
*Xuelong Gu,Qi Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel Skew Gradient Embedding (SGE) framework for reformulating thermodynamically consistent PDE models as generalized gradient flows, enabling unified stabilization for energy-stable numerical schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically handle both reversible and irreversible processes in various physical models (electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, etc.) and develop stable numerical schemes that preserve energy dissipation properties.

Method: Exploits the skew-symmetric component (exterior 2-form) of generalized gradient flow models to develop a unified stabilization strategy for constructing first- and second-order numerical schemes with flexible treatment of skew-gradient terms.

Result: The SGE framework enables design of robust numerical schemes that either preserve energy dissipation rate or ensure discrete energy stability, with natural decoupling of governing equations for improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments confirm the robustness, accuracy, and performance advantages of the proposed SGE approach, demonstrating its flexibility and generality in algorithm development for multiphysics systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel Skew Gradient Embedding (SGE) framework for systematically
reformulating thermodynamically consistent partial differential equation (PDE)
models-capturing both reversible and irreversible processes-as generalized
gradient flows. These models include a wide spectrum of models in classical
electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, rheology of complex
fluids, solid mechanics, and statistical physics. Exploiting the intrinsic
structure of generalized gradient flow models, especially, the skew symmetric
component expressed by the exterior 2-form, we develop a unified stabilization
strategy for constructing numerical schemes that either preserve the energy
dissipation rate or ensure discrete energy stability. This stabilization
strategy enables the design of both first- and second-order schemes,
highlighting the flexibility and generality of the SGE approach in algorithm
development. A key strength of SGE is its flexible treatment of skew-gradient
(zero-energy-contribution) terms arising from reversible dynamics either
implicitly or explicitly. While treated explicitly, it often leads to a natural
decoupling of the governing equations in multiphysics systems, thereby
improving computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy.
Numerical experiments confirm the robustness, accuracy, and performance
advantages of the proposed schemes.

### [6] [Optimality of quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite rule in Gaussian Sobolev spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18712)
*Yoshihito Kazashi,Yuya Suzuki,Takashi Goda*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes optimality of quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite quadrature in Sobolev spaces, showing that sparse-grid methods achieve only half the optimal convergence rate while some QMC methods achieve optimal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical performance limits of different numerical integration methods in high-dimensional Sobolev spaces with mixed dominating smoothness, particularly comparing sparse-grid quadrature with quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

Method: Mathematical analysis using worst-case error bounds in Sobolev spaces of mixed dominating smoothness, establishing lower and upper bounds for sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite quadrature and proving optimality of various QMC methods with variable transformations.

Result: Sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite quadrature achieves only N^(-α/2) convergence rate, which is suboptimal compared to the optimal rate N^(-α)(ln N)^((d-1)/2). Several QMC methods with change of variables achieve the optimal rate.

Conclusion: The suboptimal performance of sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite quadrature is inherent to its node structure and cannot be improved by weight modifications, while properly designed QMC methods can achieve optimal convergence rates in high-dimensional integration problems.

Abstract: Optimality of several quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the
sparse-grid quadrature based on the univariate Gauss--Hermite rule is proved in
the Sobolev spaces of mixed dominating smoothness of order $\alpha$, where the
optimality is in the sense of worst-case convergence rate. For sparse-grid
Gauss--Hermite quadrature, lower and upper bounds are established, with rates
coinciding up to a logarithmic factor. The dominant rate is found to be only
$N^{-\alpha/2}$ with $N$ function evaluations, although the optimal rate is
known to be $N^{-\alpha}(\ln N)^{(d-1)/2}$. The lower bound is obtained by
exploiting the structure of the Gauss--Hermite nodes and is independent of the
quadrature weights; consequently, no modification of the weights can improve
the rate $N^{-\alpha/2}$. In contrast, several quasi-Monte Carlo methods with a
change of variables are shown to achieve the optimal rate, some up to, and one
including, the logarithmic factor.

### [7] [Novel Adaptive Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18908)
*Shaoshuai Chu,Pingyao Feng,Vadim A. Kolotilov,Alexander Kurganov,Vladimir V. Ostapenko*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: New adaptive schemes for 1D/2D hyperbolic conservation laws that combine high-order accuracy in smooth regions with shock-capturing capabilities in rough areas using smoothness indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing schemes where direct application of high-order methods causes oscillations near discontinuities, while excessive use of compressive limiters creates staircase artifacts in smooth regions.

Method: Uses smoothness indicators to automatically detect rough solution parts, employing second-order finite-volume central-upwind scheme with overcompressive limiter for shocks/contacts, and switching to quasi-linear fifth-order finite-difference scheme in smooth areas. Different limiters are applied based on discontinuity type.

Result: The adaptive schemes successfully resolve nonlinear shock waves and contact discontinuities sharply while maintaining high accuracy in smooth regions, as demonstrated on challenging numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive approach effectively balances accuracy and stability by intelligently switching between high-order and shock-capturing schemes based on local solution smoothness, addressing key limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: We introduce new adaptive schemes for the one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws. Our schemes are based on an adaption strategy
recently introduced in [{\sc S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and I. Menshov}, Appl. Numer.
Math., 209 (2025)]. As there, we use a smoothness indicator (SI) to
automatically detect ``rough'' parts of the solution and employ in those areas
the second-order finite-volume low-dissipation central-upwind scheme with an
overcompressive limiter, which helps to sharply resolve nonlinear shock waves
and linearly degenerate contact discontinuities. In smooth parts, we replace
the limited second-order scheme with a quasi-linear fifth-order (in space and
third-order in time) finite-difference scheme, recently proposed in [{\sc V. A.
Kolotilov, V. V. Ostapenko, and N. A. Khandeeva}, Comput. Math. Math. Phys., 65
(2025)]. However, direct application of this scheme may generate spurious
oscillations near ``rough'' parts, while excessive use of the overcompressive
limiter may cause staircase-like nonphysical structures in smooth areas. To
address these issues, we employ the same SI to distinguish contact
discontinuities, treated with the overcompressive limiter, from other ``rough''
regions, where we switch to the dissipative Minmod2 limiter. Advantage of the
resulting adaptive schemes are clearly demonstrated on a number of challenging
numerical examples.

### [8] [A Divergence-free Preserving Mixed Finite Element Method for Thermally Driven Active Fluid Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19053)
*Nan Zheng,Qingguang Guan,Wenlong Pei,Wenju Zhao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A divergence-free preserving mixed finite element method for nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active fluid equations using auxiliary variables and DLN time integration


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the complexity of fourth-order active fluid equations while preserving divergence-free conditions and enhancing algorithm robustness

Method: Introduce two auxiliary variables (w=Δu and η) to convert fourth-order system to second-order equations, combine mixed FEM with two-step DLN time integrator, and use adaptive time-stepping strategy

Result: Proved boundedness of model energy and error estimates, validated through numerical experiments showing method's effectiveness and accuracy

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully handles complex active fluid dynamics with improved robustness and computational efficiency

Abstract: In this report, we propose a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element
method (FEM) for the system of nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active
fluid equations. By introducing two auxiliary variables, we lower the
complexity of the model and enhance the robustness of the algorithm. The
auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$ is used to convert the original fourth-order
system to an equivalent system of second-order equations, thereby easing the
regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-conforming finite element
space. The second variable $\eta$, analogous to the pressure, helps the scheme
preserve the divergence-free condition arising from the model. The two-step
Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator, unconditionally non-linear
stable and second-order accurate under non-uniform time grids, is combined with
the mixed FEM for fully discrete approximation. Due to the fine properties of
the DLN scheme, we prove the boundedness of model energy and the associated
error estimates under suitable regularity assumptions and mild time
restrictions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a
minimum-dissipation criterion is to balance computational costs and time
efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and
demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex
active fluid dynamics.

### [9] [Regularity estimate and sparse approximation of pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19093)
*Yuhua Meng,Zhongjian Wang,Stephen S. T. Yau,Zhiwen Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper establishes a priori estimates for derivatives of solutions to the pathwise robust DMZ equation in weighted Sobolev spaces, refines regularity bounds using Sobolev inequalities, and enhances the quantized tensor train method for real-time nonlinear filtering with improved efficiency over particle filters and extended Kalman filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the regularity estimates for the DMZ equation and enhance the computational efficiency of nonlinear filtering methods, particularly for high-dimensional and multi-mode problems where existing methods like particle filters and extended Kalman filters have limitations.

Method: Developed a priori estimates for derivatives in weighted Sobolev spaces, used Sobolev inequalities to sharpen regularity bounds, reduced complexity of quantized tensor train method under functional polyadic assumptions, and performed numerical simulations.

Result: The method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy for high-dimensional cubic sensor problems compared to PF and EKF, and provides accurate reconstruction of multi-mode conditional density functions where other methods fail.

Conclusion: The refined regularity estimates validate the QTT method and the enhanced approach offers an effective solution for real-time nonlinear filtering in high-dimensional and multi-mode scenarios, overcoming limitations of traditional filtering methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish an \textit{a priori} estimate for arbitrary-order
derivatives of the solution to the pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ)
equation within the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces. The weight function,
which vanishes on the physical boundary, is crucial for the \textit{a priori}
estimate, but introduces a loss of regularity near the boundary. Therefore, we
employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the
regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and
H{\"o}lder continuity estimates. The refined regularity estimate reinforces the
plausibility of the quantized tensor train (QTT) method in [S. Li, Z. Wang, S.
S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp.
4405--4412] and provides convergence guarantees of the method. To further
enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in
a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption
of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we
perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional
cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy
in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF).
Beyond this, for multi-mode problems, while the PF exhibits a lack of precision
due to its stochastic nature and the EKF is constrained by its Gaussian
assumption, the enhanced method provides an accurate reconstruction of the
multi-mode conditional density function.

### [10] [A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19178)
*William De Deyn,Ruben De Wolf,Vince Maes,Giovanni Samaey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents a noise-robust method for calculating the E×B drift in the EMC3 stellarator plasma edge transport code by extending a 1D derivative method to 2D and using a PDE-based Monte Carlo approach to directly approximate the electric field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The E×B drift significantly impacts plasma edge transport but has not been self-consistently treated in EMC3 due to noise amplification from finite difference methods when calculating electric field gradients from noisy potential data.

Method: Extended a noise-robust 1D derivative method to 2D, derived a PDE describing electric field evolution for uniform diffusion, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to directly approximate the electric field without finite difference approximations.

Result: The method demonstrated accuracy and noise robustness in test cases, successfully handling the stochastic noise inherent in EMC3 plasma field computations.

Conclusion: The proposed PDE-based Monte Carlo approach provides a viable solution for incorporating E×B drift into EMC3, improving the code's predictive capabilities by avoiding noise amplification from finite difference methods.

Abstract: One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is
the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge
transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift
is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and
heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift
into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation
of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is
proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous
work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite
difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the
stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are
inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise,
with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from,
which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the
noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that
a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case
of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the
electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need
for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method
and the noise robustness with a test case.

### [11] [Reconstruction of a potential parameter in time-fractional diffusion problems via a Kohn--Vogelius type functional: Theoretical aspects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19260)
*Hamza Kahlaoui,Mourad Hrizi,Abdessamad Oulmelk,Xiangcheng Zheng,Ahmed Hendy*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper develops a stable algorithm for reconstructing space-dependent potentials from boundary data in fractional diffusion equations using Kohn-Vogelius optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inverse potential problem in time-fractional diffusion equations, which has applications in medical imaging and material science, by providing a robust recovery method that handles noisy data.

Method: The method reformulates the inverse problem as an optimization problem minimizing a Kohn-Vogelius cost functional. It establishes theoretical foundations (existence, uniqueness, stability) and develops a conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction.

Result: Theoretical well-posedness is proven, and numerical experiments in 1D and 2D demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness, even with noisy boundary data.

Conclusion: The proposed Kohn-Vogelius optimization approach provides a stable and convergent method for potential reconstruction in fractional diffusion equations, with proven theoretical guarantees and practical numerical performance.

Abstract: Of concern is the problem of reconstructing a space-dependent potential from
boundary observations in the Caputo time-fractional diffusion equation,
utilizing a stable and robust recovery method. We develop an algorithm to
minimize the Kohn-Vogelius (KV) cost function, which measures the difference
between the solutions of two excitations. The inverse potential problem is
recast into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a
Kohn-Vogelius-type functional within a set of admissible potentials. We
establish the well-posedness of this optimization problem by proving the
existence and uniqueness of a minimizer and demonstrating its stability with
respect to perturbations in the boundary data. Furthermore, we analyze the
Fr\'echet differentiability of the KV functional and prove the Lipschitz
continuity of its gradient. These theoretical results enable the development of
a convergent conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction. The
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are confirmed through
several numerical examples in both one and two dimensions, including cases with
noisy data.

### [12] [RGDBEK: Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz Algorithm with Hybrid Parallel Implementation and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19267)
*Aneesh Panchal,Ratikanta Behera*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes RGDBEK, a novel Kaczmarz algorithm that addresses the seesaw effect and enables efficient parallel CPU-GPU implementation for large-scale linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the seesaw effect that impedes convergence stability in Kaczmarz methods and to develop an architecture that supports initialization-independent parallelism leveraging both CPU and GPU resources.

Method: Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz (RGDBEK) uses randomized selection of column and row blocks based on residual-derived probability distributions, with a hybrid parallel CPU-GPU implementation using optimized sparse matrix-vector multiplications.

Result: RGDBEK outperforms existing Kaczmarz variants (GRK, FDBK, FGBK, GDBEK) in both iteration counts and computational time on synthetic random matrices and real-world sparse matrices from SuiteSparse collection.

Conclusion: The algorithm demonstrates versatility and effectiveness in applications like finite element discretizations, image deblurring, and noisy population modeling, with future work planned for tensor systems extension and further optimization.

Abstract: Kaczmarz is one of the most prominent iterative solvers for linear systems of
equations. Despite substantial research progress in recent years, the
state-of-the-art Kaczmarz algorithms have not fully resolved the seesaw effect,
a major impediment to convergence stability. Furthermore, while there have been
advances in parallelizing the inherently sequential Kaczmarz method, no
existing architecture effectively supports initialization-independent
parallelism that fully leverages both CPU and GPU resources. This paper
proposes the Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz (RGDBEK)
algorithm, a novel Kaczmarz approach designed for efficient large-scale linear
system solutions. RGDBEK employs a randomized selection strategy for column and
row blocks based on residual-derived probability distributions, thereby
mitigating the traditional seesaw effect and enhancing convergence robustness.
Theoretical analysis establishes linear convergence of the method under
standard assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic random
matrices and real-world sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse collection
demonstrate that RGDBEK outperforms existing Kaczmarz variants, including GRK,
FDBK, FGBK, and GDBEK, in both iteration counts and computational time. In
addition, a hybrid parallel CPU-GPU implementation utilizing optimized sparse
matrix-vector multiplications via the state-of-the-art storage format improves
scalability and performance on large sparse problems. Applications in finite
element discretizations, image deblurring, and noisy population modeling
demonstrate the algorithm's versatility and effectiveness. Future work will
explore extending RGDBEK to tensor systems, optimizing parallel parameter
selection, and reducing communication overhead to further enhance efficiency
and applicability.

*Bekarys Bekmaganbetov,Hongjie Dong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Well-posedness and regularity results for second-order parabolic and elliptic systems in divergence form on the half-space with conormal boundary conditions, extending previous scalar equation results to systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend existing well-posedness and regularity results from scalar equations to systems of equations, particularly for cases with singular coefficients and boundary behavior.

Method: Analysis of solutions in mixed-norm weighted Sobolev spaces for systems with leading coefficients containing singular terms x_d^α, where coefficients are measurable in x_d and have small mean oscillations in other variables.

Result: Established well-posedness and regularity for systems with conormal boundary conditions, handling lower-order terms that may blow-up near the boundary.

Conclusion: Successfully extended the theory from scalar equations to systems, providing comprehensive results for parabolic and elliptic systems with singular coefficients and boundary behavior.

Abstract: We prove the well-posedness and regularity of solutions in mixed-norm
weighted Sobolev spaces for a class of second-order parabolic and elliptic
systems in divergence form in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d_+ = \{x_d > 0\}$
subject to the conormal boundary condition. Our work extends results previously
available for scalar equations to the case of systems of equations. The leading
coefficients are the product of $x_d^{\alpha}$ and bounded non-degenerate
matrices, where $\alpha \in (-1,\infty)$. The leading coefficients are assumed
to be merely measurable in the $x_d$ variable, and to have small mean
oscillations in small cylinders with respect to the other variables. Our
results hold for systems with lower-order terms that may blow-up near the
boundary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend and complement Sobolev type embeddings on stratified Lie groups, particularly for fractional p-sub-Laplacian operators, and to study oscillatory nonlocal subelliptic problems with applications to Heisenberg groups.

Method: Uses fractional Morrey-Sobolev embeddings and the variational principle of Ricceri to analyze nonlocal subelliptic problems involving fractional p-sub-Laplacians on stratified Lie groups.

Result: Proves the existence and asymptotic behaviors of infinitely many solutions to the nonlocal subelliptic problem when the nonlinearity oscillates near the origin or at infinity.

Conclusion: The results provide novel embeddings and solution existence theorems for fractional subelliptic problems on stratified Lie groups, with particular significance for Heisenberg groups and p=2 cases.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the fractional Morrey-Sobolev type embeddings on
stratified Lie groups. This extends and complements the Sobolev type embeddings
derived in \cite{GKR}. As an application of the results, we study the following
nonlocal subelliptic problem, \begin{equation} \begin{cases}
(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s u= \lambda \beta(x) g(u) & \text{in} \quad \Omega,
\\ u=0\quad & \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{cases}
\end{equation} where $0<s<1<p<\infty$ with $ps\geq Q$, $Q$ is the homogeneous
dimension of the stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$, $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G},
p})^s$ is the fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian on $\mathbb{G},$ $\Omega$ is an open
bounded subset of $\mathbb{G}$, $ \lambda$ is a positive real parameter, $\beta
\in L^\infty(\Omega, \R_{>0})$ and $g \in C(\mathbb{R}, \R) $ oscillates near
the origin or at infinity. By using the variational principle of Ricceri, we
prove the existence and asymptotic behaviors of infinitely many solutions to
the problem under consideration. We emphasize that the results obtained here
are also novel for $\mathbb{G}$ being the Heisenberg group and $p=2$.

*Stan Palasek*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Construction of smooth initial data in BMO^{-1} for Navier-Stokes equations that produces arbitrarily large global solutions, disproving certain a priori estimates and showing first example of unbounded norm growth in well-posed setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge hypothetical a priori estimates for strong solutions in terms of critical norms of initial data, and demonstrate that norm growth can occur even in well-posed settings.

Method: Construct a family of smooth initial data bounded in BMO^{-1}(T^3) that exhibits inverse cascade across unbounded number of modes, with growth mechanism based on repeated squaring by quadratic nonlinearity.

Result: Successfully created solutions showing arbitrarily large norm growth, ruling out various hypothetical a priori estimates. The growth mechanism relies on largeness in B^{-1}_{∞,∞} and is distinct from norm inflation/ill-posedness phenomena.

Conclusion: This provides the first example of unbounded norm growth in well-posed Navier-Stokes setting, fundamentally challenging existing understanding of solution behavior and a priori estimates in critical spaces.

Abstract: We construct a family of smooth initial data for the Navier-Stokes equations,
bounded in $BMO^{-1}(\mathbb T^3)$, that gives rise to arbitrarily large global
solutions. As a consequence, we rule out various hypothetical a priori
estimates for strong solutions in terms of a critical norm of the initial data.
To our knowledge, this is the first example of unbounded norm growth in the
well-posed setting. The solutions exhibit an inverse cascade across an
unbounded number of modes, with growth resulting from repeated squaring by the
quadratic nonlinearity. This mechanism relies on largeness of the data in
$B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$ and is fundamentally distinct from instantaneous norm
inflation and ill-posedness phenomena.

### [16] [Well-posedness of the Electron MHD with random diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18640)
*Ruimeng Hu,Qirui Peng,Xu Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that adding random diffusion restores local and global well-posedness for 3D Electron Magnetohydrodynamics equations in Gevrey spaces, extending stochastic regularization techniques to quasilinear magnetic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The EMHD equations without resistivity are generally ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to their quasilinear structure. The authors are motivated by recent work on inviscid primitive equations to explore stochastic regularization.

Method: The authors introduce a random diffusion term and analyze its effect on the EMHD equations. They prove local well-posedness almost surely in appropriate Gevrey classes, and under stronger diffusion with small initial data, establish global well-posedness with high probability.

Result: The random diffusion term successfully restores local well-posedness almost surely in Gevrey classes. With slightly stronger diffusion and small initial data, global well-posedness is achieved with high probability.

Conclusion: This work extends stochastic regularization techniques to a broader class of quasilinear magnetic systems relevant to plasma physics, providing a framework for handling ill-posed problems in EMHD equations.

Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD)
equations in the absence of resistivity, a regime that is generally ill-posed
in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the system's quasilinear structure.
Motivated by the recent work of one of the authors on the inviscid primitive
equations (R.~Hu, Q.~Lin, and R.~Liu, \emph{Journal of Nonlinear Science},
35:84, 2025), we introduce a random diffusion term and demonstrate that it
restores local well-posedness almost surely in appropriate Gevrey classes.
Furthermore, under slightly stronger diffusion and small initial data, we
establish global well-posedness with high probability. These results extend the
scope of stochastic regularization techniques to a broader class of quasilinear
magnetic systems relevant to plasma physics.

### [17] [Global Existence of Solutions for A Class of Nonlocal Reaction-Diffusion Systems and Their Diffusive Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18645)
*Md Shah Alam,Jeff Morgan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies global existence of solutions for semilinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems with m components, establishing existence, uniqueness, and boundedness results, and generalizing diffusive limit results while providing numerical verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the global existence and boundedness of solutions for nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems, which have applications in various fields including biology and physics, and to extend existing results on diffusive limits.

Method: The authors use L^p energy type functionals to establish uniform boundedness, employ duality arguments for mixed diffusion systems, and provide numerical simulations to verify theoretical results.

Result: Global existence and uniqueness of component-wise nonnegative solutions are obtained. Solutions are shown to be uniformly bounded in L^p space for p ≥ 2. The diffusive limit result of Laurencot and Walker is generalized, and numerical verification confirms the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes comprehensive existence and boundedness results for nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems, extends previous diffusive limit theorems, and provides numerical evidence supporting the theoretical framework for systems with mixed local and nonlocal diffusion.

Abstract: In this work, we study the global existence of solutions for a class of
semilinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems with $m$ components on a bounded
domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. The initial data is
assumed to be component-wise nonnegative and bounded, and the reaction vector
field associated with the system is assumed to be quasi-positive and satisfy a
generalized mass control condition. We obtain global existence and uniqueness
of component-wise nonnegative solutions. With the additional assumption that
the reaction vector field satisfies a linear intermediate sums condition, we
employ an $L^p$ energy type functional to establish the uniform boundedness of
solutions in $L^p(\Omega)$ for all $2 \le p<\infty$ independent of the nonlocal
diffusion operator for our system in $L^p$ space for $2 \le p < \infty$. This
allows us to generalize a recent diffusive limit result of Laurencot and Walker
\cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal}. We, also analyze a class of $m$ component
reaction-diffusion systems in which some of the components diffuse nonlocally
and the other components diffuse locally, where the latter components satisfy
homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under various assumptions, we
establish global existence and uniqueness of componentwise nonnegative
solutions by using duality arguments. Finally, we numerically verify our
diffusive limit result. We also numerically solve the reaction-diffusion
systems with a mixture of nonlocal and local diffusion and show the visual
difference of its solutions with the system in which all components diffuse
nonlocally.

### [18] [Global bounded solutions of the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via Couette flow and logistic source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18718)
*Shikun Cui,Lili Wang,Wendong Wang,Juncheng Wei,Guoxu Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper investigates global bounded solutions for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system using Couette flow or logistic source in a finite channel, showing that strong Couette flow with small initial velocity ensures global existence regardless of initial mass when logistic source is present, and for finite initial mass above a threshold when logistic source is absent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Patlak-Keller-Segel system in 3D is known to have solutions that blow up in finite time regardless of initial cell mass. The authors aim to find conditions under which global bounded solutions exist for the coupled system with fluid dynamics.

Method: The study uses Couette flow and logistic source terms in a finite channel setting. Mathematical analysis is employed to prove existence conditions for global bounded solutions under specific parameter constraints.

Result: Two main results: (1) With logistic source term, strong Couette flow and small initial velocity guarantee global bounded solutions for any initial mass M; (2) Without logistic source, strong Couette flow and small initial velocity ensure global solutions for finite initial mass M above a threshold of (8π/9)^-.

Conclusion: Couette flow can prevent blow-up in the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system, with logistic source providing stronger regularization that eliminates mass restrictions entirely.

Abstract: As is well-known, the solutions to the Patlak-Keller-Segel system in 3D may
blow up in finite time regardless of any initial cell mass. In this paper, we
investigate the existence of global bounded solutions of the 3D
Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with a large initial cell mass via
Couette flow or logistic source in a finite channel. On the one hand, it is
proved that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial
velocity is small, the bounded solutions of the system are global in time
without any limitation on the initial mass $M$ if the logistic source term
exists. On the other hand, if the logistic source term vanishes, it is proved
that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial velocity is
small, the solutions with a finite initial mass $M$, whose lower bound is $
\left(\frac{8\pi}{9}\right)^-$, are global in time.

### [19] [Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded domains. Part II: Existence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18797)
*Jørgen Endal,Espen R Jakobsen,Ola Mæhlen*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper proves existence of entropy solutions for degenerate mixed-type parabolic-hyperbolic equations with nonlocal diffusion on bounded domains, completing the well-posedness theory established in previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend nonlocal theories from whole space to bounded domains and local theories on domains to nonlocal cases, while developing a formulation that doesn't assume energy estimates but derives them as consequences.

Method: Proves existence via fixed point argument for bounded operators, then extends to general operators through approximations. Uses nonlinear weak-* compactness and entropy-process solutions to overcome lack of strong compactness. Key techniques include stability results and novel arguments for transferring weak regularity.

Result: Establishes existence of bounded entropy solutions under general assumptions, provides characterization of Lévy operators with compact embedding properties, and develops several independent results including energy estimates as consequences rather than assumptions.

Conclusion: Completes the well-posedness theory for degenerate mixed-type equations on bounded domains, bridging local and nonlocal theories while introducing novel compactness arguments and energy estimate derivations.

Abstract: We study well-posedness of degenerate mixed-type parabolic-hyperbolic
equations $$ \partial_tu+\textrm{div}\big(f(u)\big)=\mathcal{L}[b(u)] $$ on
bounded domains with general Dirichlet boundary/exterior conditions. The
nonlocal diffusion operator $\mathcal{L}$ is a symmetric L{\'e}vy operator
(e.g. fractional Laplacians) and $b$ is nondecreasing and allowed to have
degenerate regions ($b'=0$). In [N. Alibaud, J. Endal, E. R. Jakobsen, and O.
M{\ae}hlen. Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded
domains. \emph{Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Anal. Non Lineaire}, 2025. Published
online first, DOI 10.4171/AIHPC/153], we introduced an entropy solution
formulation for the problem and showed uniqueness of bounded entropy solutions
under general assumptions. In this paper we complete the program by proving
existence of such solutions. Starting from known results for scalar
conservations laws, existence is proved first for bounded/zero order operators
$\mathcal{L}$ by a fixed point argument, and then extended in steps to more
general operators via approximations of $\mathcal{L}$. Lack of strong
compactness of approximate solutions $u_n$ is overcome through nonlinear
weak-$\star$ compactness and entropy-process solutions. Key ingredients are
stability results for our formulation and \textit{strong} compactness of the
term $b(u)$, both with respect to variations in $\mathcal{L}$. Strong
compactness follows from energy estimates and novel arguments for transferring
weak regularity from $\partial_t u_n$ to $\partial_t b(u_n)$. Our work can be
seen as both extending nonlocal theories from the whole space to domains and
local theories on domains to the nonlocal case. Unlike local theories our
formulation does not assume energy estimates. They are now a consequence of the
formulation, but as opposed to previous nonlocal theories, they play an
essential role in our arguments. Several results of independent interest are
established, including a characterization of the L{\'e}vy operators
$\mathcal{L}$ for which the corresponding energy/Sobolev-space compactly embeds
into $L^2$.

TL;DR: This paper studies the existence of non-constant least energy solutions for a gradient elliptic system with Neumann boundary conditions, analyzing both cooperative and competitive regimes in subcritical and critical dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the existence of non-constant least energy solutions for elliptic systems with Neumann boundary conditions, covering both cooperative (β > 0) and competitive (β < 0) cases, as well as definite and indefinite scenarios (λ₁,λ₂ ∈ ℝ).

Method: The analysis employs various mathematical techniques including linking theorems, minimization over Nehari manifolds, and direct minimization on the set of non-trivial weak solutions, depending on parameter values β, λ₁, λ₂.

Result: The paper establishes existence results for non-constant least energy solutions in different parameter regimes, with techniques adaptable to previously untreated cases for Dirichlet conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive existence results for least energy solutions in gradient elliptic systems with Neumann boundary conditions, covering various parameter configurations and extending methodology to Dirichlet boundary problems.

Abstract: We study the following gradient elliptic system with Neumann boundary
conditions \begin{equation*} -\Delta u + \lambda_1 u = u^3 + \beta uv^2, \
-\Delta v + \lambda_2 v = v^3 + \beta u^2 v \ \text{in } \Omega,\qquad
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} = 0 \
\text{on } \partial \Omega, \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N
$ is a bounded $ C^2$ domain with $ N \leq 4 $, and $ \nu $ denotes the outward
unit normal on the boundary. We investigate the existence of non-constant least
energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta > 0 $) and the competitive ($
\beta < 0 $) regimes, considering both the definite and the indefinite case,
namely $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb R$. We emphasize that our analysis
includes both the subcritical case $ N \leq 3 $ and the critical case $ N = 4
$.
  Depending on the values of $\beta,\lambda_1,\lambda_2$, the least energy
solution is obtained either via a linking theorem, by minimizing over a
suitable Nehari manifold, or by direct minimization on the set of all
non-trivial weak solutions. Our results and techniques can be also adapted to
cover some previously untreated cases for Dirichlet conditions.

Motivation: Time-fractional heat equations have wide applications in science and engineering for modeling real-world problems, making the study of their blow-up solutions significant.

Method: First studies local/global existence of positive solutions and finite-time blow-up under restricted conditions, then investigates the blow-up set to determine where blow-up occurs.

Result: The blow-up can only occur at a boundary point, and positive solutions exist locally/globally with finite-time blow-up under certain conditions.

Conclusion: The research provides important insights into the behavior of blow-up solutions for time-fractional heat equations with nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions, particularly regarding blow-up location and solution existence.

Abstract: The study of blow-up solution of time-fractional heat equations is of
significant and wide-ranging interest for its multitude of applications. These

Motivation: Computational models provide insights into complex biological processes like cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration.

Method: Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy, enabling joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability.

Result: Applied to glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, while parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to mechanistic grounding. Model discrepancy exposes structural limitations.

Conclusion: The comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems, clarifying where model refinement is necessary.

Abstract: Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological
processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes
them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically

TL;DR: This paper studies the unique recovery of time-independent lower order terms in symmetric first order perturbations of the Riemannian wave equation using wave measurements from disjoint open sets on a closed Riemannian manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop mathematical methods for recovering unknown parameters in wave equations from boundary measurements, which has applications in inverse problems, geophysics, and medical imaging.

Method: The method involves sending and measuring waves in disjoint open sets of a closed Riemannian manifold. The analysis relies on geometric control conditions and local symmetry conditions for distance functions to ensure unique recovery.

Result: The paper shows that if the receiver set satisfies a geometric control condition and certain local symmetry conditions, then wave measurements are sufficient to recover the lower order terms up to natural gauge equivalence.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that under appropriate geometric conditions, wave measurements from disjoint sets can uniquely determine the lower order terms in Riemannian wave equations, with applications including cases where the complement of the receiver set is contained in a simple Riemannian manifold.

Abstract: We study the unique recovery of time-independent lower order terms appearing
in the symmetric first order perturbation of the Riemannian wave equation by
sending and measuring waves in disjoint open sets of \textit{a priori} known
closed Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that if the set where we
capture the waves satisfies a geometric control condition as well as a certain
local symmetry condition for the distance functions, then the aforementioned
measurement is sufficient to recover the lower order terms up to the natural
gauge. For instance, our result holds if the complement of the receiver set is
contained in a simple Riemannian manifold.

Motivation: To establish the mathematical foundation for dissipative quantum fluids confined by external harmonic potentials, extending previous work on Navier-Stokes-Korteweg systems

Method: Rewrite evolution equations using Gaussian reference measure and adapt previous strategies with substantial modifications for this specific reference measure choice

Result: Proves existence of global weak solutions to the Quantum Navier-Stokes system

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes the existence of global weak solutions for quantum fluids under harmonic confinement, despite the need for significant methodological adaptations

Abstract: We consider a dissipative quantum fluid on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$
($d\geq 1$) confined by an external harmonic potential. The dynamics of the
quantum fluid is described by the Quantum Navier-Stokes (QNS) system which is a
particular case of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg systems. The goal of this paper
is to prove the existence of global weak solutions to the QNS system. To this
end, we write the evolution equations with respect to a Gaussian reference
measure and follow the general strategy of previous works. Nevertheless,
several substantial modifications have to be done due to our choice of the
reference measure.

Motivation: To establish stability and large-time behavior analysis for 3D magneto-micropolar equations with horizontal dissipation, which is important for understanding the long-term dynamics of such complex fluid systems

Method: Relies on the special structure of the equations and anisotropic Sobolev-type inequalities, with initial data and its vertical derivatives required to be sufficiently small in L² space

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous mathematical framework for solving conservation laws with discontinuous flux functions, which are common in physical applications but challenging due to the discontinuities.

Method: Construct a stable semigroup of solutions by studying piecewise smooth fluxes across interfaces described by Heaviside-type discontinuities and considering heterogeneous flux functions with bounded spatial variation.

Result: Established well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for scalar conservation laws with discontinuous non-degenerate fluxes and heterogeneous flux functions.

Conclusion: A stable solution framework was successfully constructed, proving the well-posedness of these challenging conservation law problems.

Abstract: We study the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for scalar conservation
laws with discontinuous, non-degenerate fluxes. Locally, the fluxes are
piecewise smooth across interfaces described by a Heaviside-type discontinuity,
with left and right states depending smoothly on both space and the solution
variable. The interface is given by a smooth function, and the fluxes vanish at
the boundary values of the admissible interval for the solution.
  In addition, we consider the more general case of heterogeneous flux
functions with bounded variation in the spatial variable and smooth dependence
on the solution variable, again vanishing at the prescribed boundary states.
For this setting, we construct a stable semigroup of solutions, thereby
establishing a well-posed solution framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish necessary and sufficient conditions for positivity of semigroups associated with second-order elliptic systems, particularly when dealing with operator-valued coefficients.

Method: Analysis of second-order elliptic systems with operator-valued coefficients, examining conditions under which the associated semigroup exhibits positivity properties.

Result: Proved that positivity of the semigroup occurs precisely when the system is essentially decoupled and has real-valued coefficients, allowing replacement by an equivalent decoupled system.

Conclusion: The positivity property of elliptic system semigroups serves as a precise indicator of decoupling in the underlying differential equations, with interesting complications arising from Banach space valued integration when considering operator-valued coefficients.

Abstract: We show that the semigroup associated to a second-order elliptic system is
positive if and only if the differential equations are essentially decoupled
and the coefficients are real-valued. This means the system can be replaced by
an equivalent decoupled system (which defines the same semigroup). Instead of
matrix coefficients we more generally consider operator-valued coefficients,
which leads to interesting additional difficulties with respect to Banach space
valued integration.

Conclusion: The theory provides a versatile framework for nonlocal stochastic evolutions on configuration spaces, with reflecting solutions ensuring chain rule validity and uniqueness.

Abstract: We extend the generalized gradient-flow framework of Peletier, Rossi,
Savar\'e, and Tse to singular jump processes on abstract metric spaces, moving
beyond the translation-invariant kernels considered in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and
$\mathbb{T}^d$ in previous contributions. To address the analytical challenges
posed by singularities, we introduce reflecting solutions, a new solution
concept inspired by reflected Dirichlet forms, which ensures the validity of a
chain rule and restores uniqueness. We establish existence, stability, and
compactness results for these solutions by approximating singular kernels with
regularized ones, and we show their robustness under such approximations. The
framework encompasses dissipative and balanced solutions, clarifies their
relations, and highlights the role of density properties of Lipschitz functions
in upgrading weak formulations to reflecting solutions. As an application, we
demonstrate the versatility of our theory to nonlocal stochastic evolutions on
configuration spaces.

### [32] [Least-energy solutions of the Brézis-Nirenberg problem in the non-coercive case in dimension $3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19145)
*Hussein Cheikh Ali,Bruno Premoselli*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies the existence of least-energy solutions for the Brézis-Nirenberg problem on bounded smooth domains in R^n (n≥3), particularly focusing on the n=3 case. The authors prove existence when λ is near eigenvalues of -Δ satisfying a positive mass condition, introducing a new variational approach based on spectral theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Brézis-Nirenberg problem is a celebrated nonlinear elliptic equation that has been extensively studied. The motivation is to establish existence results for least-energy solutions, particularly in the challenging case when n=3 and λ≥Λ₁ (the first eigenvalue), where previous results were limited.

Method: The authors introduce a new variational problem inspired by spectral theory: for λ≥0, they consider the principal eigenvalue of -Δ-λ on weighted L^2 spaces with weights u^(2^*-2), then minimize this over normalized weights. This defines a non-smooth variational problem for which they develop a variational theory.

Result: For n=3, least-energy solutions exist when λ belongs to a left neighborhood of any eigenvalue of -Δ satisfying a positive mass assumption. This provides the first existence result for general smooth bounded domains when n=3 and λ≥Λ₁. For n≥4, they show the energy function is discontinuous exactly at eigenvalues of -Δ.

Conclusion: The paper establishes new existence results for the Brézis-Nirenberg problem using a novel variational approach based on spectral theory. The positive mass assumption plays a crucial role in ensuring the existence of least-energy solutions, particularly in the three-dimensional case where previous results were scarce.

Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 3$ and
$\lambda \ge 0$. We consider the celebrated Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:critlambda:abs} \tag{*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  -\Delta u -\lambda u & =\left|u\right|^{2^*-2}u &\hbox{ in } \Omega,
  u & = 0 \quad \text{ in } \partial \Omega,
  \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation} where $2^* = \frac{2n}{n-2}$. When $n=3$
we investigate the existence of \emph{least-energy solutions} for this problem,
that we define as having the lowest $L^{2^*}(\Omega)$ norm among all non-zero
solutions. We prove that least-energy solutions of the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg
problem exist when $\lambda$ belongs to a left neighbourhood of any eigenvalue
of $-\Delta$ that we explicitly characterise by a positive mass assumption. We
obtain in particular the first \emph{existence} result for the
Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on a general smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ when
$n=3$ and $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$. In order to do this we introduce, for any
$\lambda \ge 0$, a new variational problem inspired from spectral-theoretic
considerations which is as follows: for any $u \in L^{2^*}(\Omega), u>0$ a.e.,
we consider the principal eigenvalue of $- \Delta-\lambda$ on the weighted
space $L^2(\Omega, u^{2^*-2} dx)$, whose value we then minimise over the set of
normalised weights $\Vert u \Vert_{2^*} = 1$. When $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$ this
defines a new, non-smooth variational problem for which we develop a
variational theory. We prove that its minimisers exist under the aforementioned
positive mass assumption and that they yield \emph{least-energy} solutions. We
also obtain new results in the higher-dimensional case $n \ge 4$, where we show
that the energy function of the Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem is discontinuous
exactly at the eigenvalues of $- \Delta$.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper establishes higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities on non-compact Riemannian manifolds that support isoperimetric inequalities, particularly focusing on manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, and manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities to non-compact Riemannian manifolds that satisfy isoperimetric inequalities, building upon previous work by Chen and Li.

Method: The proofs utilize various symmetrization techniques, with the key ingredient being an iterated Talenti's comparison principle. The approach extends the non-iterated version analogous to Chen and Li's result.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends higher-order Sobolev and Rellich inequalities to non-compact Riemannian manifolds through symmetrization techniques and an iterated Talenti comparison principle, providing results for important geometric settings.

Abstract: In this paper we establish higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities

TL;DR: The paper establishes exponential growth of magnetic fields in kinematic dynamo equations for helical velocity fields, providing rigorous mathematical justification for the Ponomarenko dynamo mechanism with growth rate ε¹ᐟ³.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the physically conjectured process of magnetic field generation in helical flows (Ponomarenko dynamo), addressing the kinematic dynamo equations with resistivity ε>0.

Method: Construct unstable eigenmodes via detailed resolvent estimates of the linear operator using suitable Green's functions that approximate the local behavior. The approach is applied to both unbounded domains (ℝ²×𝕋) and bounded domains with perfectly conducting wall boundary conditions.

Result: Existence of solutions exhibiting exponential growth over time is established for a broad class of C³ velocity fields with helical geometry. An explicit asymptotic expression for the growing mode is derived, providing a sharp description of the instability mechanism.

Conclusion: The results offer a rigorous and sharp mathematical justification for helical flows sustaining magnetic field generation in the Ponomarenko dynamo, with the growth rate scaling as ε¹ᐟ³, confirming physical conjectures through precise analytical methods.

Abstract: We consider the kinematic dynamo equations for a passive vector in
$\mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$
describing the evolution of a magnetic field with resistivity $\varepsilon>0$,
that is transported by a given velocity field. For a broad class of $C^3$
velocity fields with helical geometry, we establish the existence of solutions
that exhibit exponential growth over time. We construct an unstable eigenmode
via detailed resolvent estimates of the corresponding linear operator, which we
carry out by introducing suitable Green's functions that accurately approximate
the local behaviour of the true system. This approach yields an explicit
asymptotic expression for the growing mode, providing a sharp description of
the instability mechanism. We first derive the results with
$\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^2$ for a large class of velocity fields that includes
finite energy examples. We then consider the case of domains with boundary,
where $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{T}$ denotes a periodic cylinder, annular
cylinder, or the exterior of a cylinder, with the boundary conditions of
perfectly conducting walls. Our results offer a rigorous and sharp mathematical
justification for the physically conjectured process by which helical flows can
sustain magnetic field generation in the Ponomarenko dynamo, with growth rate
of order $\varepsilon^{1/3}$.

*Shubham Rai,Badri Prasad Patel*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is developed for laminated composite panels, featuring failure mode dependency and optimized parameter characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more accurate damage prediction model for laminated composite structures that can capture different damage behaviors in tension and compression, addressing limitations of existing failure mode independent models.

Method: Used steepest descent optimization to characterize damage parameters from experimental stress-strain curves, implemented finite element method with first-order shear deformation theory and Newton-Raphson solver for non-linear analysis of composite curved beams.

Result: The proposed model effectively captures non-linearity in load-deflection curves due to stiffness degradation and different damage behaviors in tension vs compression, showing better performance than existing models.

Conclusion: The developed failure mode dependent damage model provides thermodynamically consistent and accurate damage prediction for laminated composites, successfully capturing material-specific damage evolution consistent with experimental stress-strain responses.

Abstract: In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent
continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is
proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The
damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear
experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is
used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental
stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully
characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a
moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order
shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to
get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson
method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode
dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the
efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs
deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension
andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and
strength properties of the material, respectively.

*Marcel Ferrari,Cyrill Püntener,Alexander Sotoudeh,Niklas Viebig*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in Stokes equations with variable viscosity, featuring a novel RAS-Jacobi smoother that achieves 3x speedup through temporal blocking and improved cache reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance challenges in geophysical flow simulations by developing cache-aware stencil designs for modern heterogeneous architectures, particularly for multigrid smoothing in incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity.

Method: Investigated five smoother variants: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and novel RAS-Jacobi with temporal blocking. Used energy-based residual norm for validation and high-contrast sinker benchmark for testing.

Result: RAS-Jacobi smoother achieved best performance, sustaining over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores with 3x speedup compared to C++ Jacobi baseline. All smoothers scaled well within single NUMA domain.

Conclusion: Temporal blocking strategies, previously used for distributed-memory communication reduction, provide substantial benefits at socket/NUMA level. Cache-aware stencil design is crucial for modern architectures, with potential for extension to 3D problems and GPU accelerators.

Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized
matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible
Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow
problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different
optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked
fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a
strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache
reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that
balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations
using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic
numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of
the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a
single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best
performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency
up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++
Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic.
These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in
distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide
substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the
importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous
architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking
strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.

### [37] [Physics-Informed Field Inversion for Sparse Data Assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19160)
*Levent Ugur,Beckett Y. Zhou*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Proposes Physics-Informed Field Inversion (PIFI) to enhance FIML by adding physical loss terms, improving performance with sparse, truncated, and noisy data while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FIML requires dense observations for field inversion, limiting its use with sparse data. The study aims to incorporate physics into the inversion process to overcome this limitation.

Method: Adds a physical loss term to FIML's field inversion stage, embedding complex physics into low-fidelity models. This provides dense gradient information and acts as adaptive regularization.

Result: PIFI improves reconstruction accuracy for limited data cases (sparse, truncated, noisy) and enables accurate posterior correction parameter distribution with fewer realizations.

Conclusion: Physics-informed enhancement makes FIML more data-efficient and effective for practical engineering applications with limited observations, with acceptable computational cost increases.

Abstract: Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering
applications, given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these
approaches, such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting
low-fidelity models by leveraging available observations of the problem.
However, the solely data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally
requires dense observations that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study,
we propose a physical loss term addition to the field inversion stage of the
FIML technique similar to the physics-informed machine learning applications.
This addition embeds the complex physics of the problem into the low-fidelity
model, which allows for obtaining dense gradient information for every
correction parameter and acts as an adaptive regularization term improving
inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed Field Inversion approach is
tested using three different examples and highlights that incorporating
physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for limited data
cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally, this
modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter
distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase
in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an
acceptable level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve modeling of multiphase architected materials by developing a more efficient variational physics-informed computational framework that can handle material discontinuities and complex geometries better than classical PINN formulations.

Method: VPINN methodology based on Petrov-Galerkin approach with deep neural networks as trial functions and local polynomials as test functions, combined with Galerkin Boundary Element Method (GBEM) for mechanical field data generation and adaptive tree-based integration for weak-form integrals.

Result: VPINNs accurately capture deformation fields in double-phase materials, tree-based integration robustly handles material discontinuities with substantial computational cost reductions, and incorporation of semi-analytical information at auxiliary points enhances performance.

Conclusion: The proposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages over classical PINNs for modeling multiphase architected materials, paving the way for variational physics-informed computational models for complex architected multiphase materials and structures.

Abstract: The current contribution develops a Variational Physics-Informed Neural
Network (VPINN)-based framework for the analysis and design of multiphase
architected solids. The elaborated VPINN methodology is based on the
Petrov-Galerkin approach, with a deep neural network acting as trial function
and local polynomials as test functions. For the analysis, a Galerkin Boundary
Element Method (GBEM) scheme is developed to generate the mechanical field
data, employing solely domain boundary information. The VPINN methodology is
complemented by an adaptive, tree-based integration scheme for the evaluation
of the weak-form integrals. Different double-phase material architectures are
considered, with the VPINNs demonstrating their ability to capture the
deformation fields with considerable accuracy. Moreover, the performance
enhancement by the incorporation of additional semi-analytical information at
auxiliary internal points is analyzed. Tree-based integration schemes are shown
to be capable of robustly capturing inner material discontinuities upon
substantial computational cost reductions. The results suggest that the
proposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages in the modeling of
multiphase architected materials compared to classical PINN formulations. The
analysis paves the way for the development of variational physics-informed
computational models for the mechanical analysis of complex architected
multiphase materials and structures.

TL;DR: This thesis investigates universal temperature and density profile shapes in W7-X fusion device by comparing experimental profiles with gyrokinetic simulations to test confinement time scalings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance fusion device development beyond W7-X by understanding energy confinement time scaling and verifying theoretical predictions of universal profile shapes.

Method: Experimental profiles from Thomson scattering diagnostics are analyzed. Gradient length scales are extracted and used as boundary conditions for gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations using GX code. Heat fluxes from simulations reconstruct profiles via power balance equations.

Result: Reconstructed density profiles are steeper than experimental measurements. Additional discharges with peaked density profiles are examined, and scale length ratios are incorporated into simulations to investigate discrepancies.

Conclusion: Discrepancies between simulated and measured profiles are discussed, with potential explanations including particle sources and neoclassical transport mechanisms, aiming to understand profile shape and transport role in plasma confinement.

Abstract: To advance the development of future fusion devices beyond Wendelstein 7-X
(W7-X), a robust understanding of energy confinement time scaling is crucial.
Universal temperature and density profile shapes are theoretically anticipated
through a comparison of the empirical ISS04 confinement time scaling with
predictions based on Gyro-Bohm heat flux scaling. This thesis investigates the
presence of these universalities in W7-X experimental profiles and subsequently
tests existing confinement time scalings against this data.
  Experimental profiles are obtained from Thomson scattering diagnostics.
Gradient length scales, defined as the radial derivative of the logarithmic
quantity of the investigated profiles, are extracted from these profiles
through fitting procedures. These scales serve as boundary conditions for
subsequent gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations using the GX code. The simulated
heat fluxes are then employed to reconstruct profiles by solving the power
balance equation and density evolution.
  A comparison of these reconstructed profiles with the averaged experimental
profiles reveals that the predicted density profiles are steeper than those
measured in the reference dataset. To investigate this discrepancy, additional
discharges exhibiting more peaked density profiles, including both
high-performance and low-power plasmas, are examined. Furthermore, the ratio of
experimental temperature and density scale lengths is incorporated as an input
into the simulations, and the resulting simulated heat fluxes are evaluated.
  Discrepancies between the simulated and measured profiles are discussed, with
potential explanations encompassing particle sources and neoclassical transport
mechanisms. This comprehensive approach aims to deepen our understanding of the
critical role of profile shape and transport mechanisms in plasma confinement.

TL;DR: Conceptual design of Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for EXL-50U spherical tokamak to measure plasma turbulence using beam tracing and optimal launch angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DBS is important for measuring plasma turbulence in tokamaks, which is crucial for transport studies. The EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle (~35°) requires careful design to maximize backscattered signal.

Method: Used SCOTTY beam tracing code to predict cutoff locations and scattering wavenumbers for various plasma scenarios. Determined optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure wavevector perpendicular to magnetic field at cutoff.

Result: Able to measure scattering locations at 0.15 < ρ < 1 with turbulent wavenumbers 2.47 cm⁻¹ < k⊥ < 9.49 cm⁻¹. Proposed toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels (40-60 GHz U-band) with quasioptical system.

Conclusion: The proposed DBS diagnostic design successfully addresses EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle challenge and provides comprehensive turbulence measurement capability across the plasma radius.

Abstract: The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop
technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys.
Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering
(DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable
of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in
tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port
window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF
2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs
and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma
scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$
$\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$
$k_{\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial
coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding
turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to
ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field
at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This
matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle,
$\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the
use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are
well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system
that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand turbulence in strongly coupled plasmas where long-range interparticle interactions create viscoelastic properties, which differ fundamentally from conventional turbulence governed by inertia and viscosity.

Method: Large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of driven dissipative strongly coupled plasmas, analyzing scale-dependent flow dynamics and energy transfer processes.

Result: Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling E(k), Φ(k) ∝ k^{-3.5}. Velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and velocity increment PDFs deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, showing signatures of intermittency.

Conclusion: Strongly coupled plasmas represent a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.

Abstract: Turbulence in strongly coupled plasmas (SCP) poses a unique challenge due to
long-range interparticle interactions that impart viscoelastic properties to
the medium. We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic
turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular
dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent
flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and
viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence,
governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer
processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy
spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \Phi(k) \propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space,
velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability
distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from
Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These
findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic
turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and
nonequilibrium statistical physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Runaway electron termination can cause material explosions and fast debris ejection, leading to mechanical impacts and cratering on vessel components. Previous studies only examined normal impacts, leaving oblique impacts unexplored.

Method: Controlled reproduction of oblique high-velocity tungsten-on-tungsten impacts using a two-stage light gas gun shooting system.

Result: Documented strong dependence of crater characteristics and morphology on incident angle. Extracted reliable empirical damage law for crater depth dependence on incident angle.

Conclusion: Oblique impacts significantly affect crater formation, with quantifiable relationships between incident angle and crater properties, providing important data for understanding material damage in fusion reactor environments.

Abstract: Runaway electron termination on plasma facing components can trigger material
explosions that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Due to
the large kinetic energies of the ejected dust particles, their subsequent
mechanical impacts on the vessel lead to extensive cratering. Earlier
experimental studies of high velocity micrometric tungsten dust collisions with
tungsten plates focused exclusively on normal impacts. Here, oblique high
velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled
manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of
the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is
documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of
the crater depth on the incident angle.

TL;DR: AI-driven framework uses graph neural networks and Bayesian optimization to recommend optimal MCMC parameters for preconditioning linear systems, achieving better performance with 50% less search budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Krylov subspace solvers for large sparse linear systems require preconditioners to accelerate convergence, but MCMC-based preconditioning effectiveness depends on parameters that vary across matrices, making manual search costly.

Method: Uses graph neural network surrogate to predict preconditioning speed from matrix A and MCMC parameters, then applies Bayesian acquisition function to select parameter sets most likely to minimize iterations.

Result: On unseen ill-conditioned systems, achieves better preconditioning with 50% of conventional search budget, yielding ~10% reduction in iterations to convergence.

Conclusion: Provides an effective route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems through AI-driven parameter optimization.

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering,
and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet
convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments
usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix
inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,
but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;
manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending
MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts
preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition
function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On
a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better
preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods,
yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results
suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale
systems.

### [47] [Minimal surface doublings and electrostatics for Schrödinger operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18630)
*Adrian Chun-Pong Chu,Daniel Stern*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: A variational approach to minimal surface doubling constructions, proving that generic 3-manifolds contain infinite sequences of embedded minimal surfaces with bounded area and arbitrarily large genus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a new variational perspective on Kapouleas's doubling construction for minimal surfaces, relating it to Coulomb-type interaction energy and establishing existence results for minimal doublings in generic 3-manifolds.

Method: Introduces a variational approach analyzing minimizers of a Coulomb-type interaction energy, connecting the Kapouleas-McGrath doubling construction to nondegenerate critical points of this energy functional.

Result: Proves that in a generic closed 3-manifold, every two-sided embedded minimal surface of index one admits a sequence of minimal doublings, leading to infinite sequences of embedded minimal surfaces with bounded area and arbitrarily large genus.

Conclusion: The variational approach successfully establishes the existence of minimal doublings and provides a geometric description of the resulting surfaces, showing generic 3-manifolds contain rich families of high-genus minimal surfaces.

Abstract: Twenty years ago, N. Kapouleas introduced a singular perturbation
construction known as "doubling", which produces sequences of high-genus
minimal surfaces converging to a given minimal surface with multiplicity two.
Doubling constructions have since been implemented successfully in several
settings, with deep work of Kapouleas-McGrath reducing their existence theory
to the problem of finding suitable families of ansatz data on the initial
minimal surface.
  In this paper, we introduce a variational approach to the existence of
minimal doublings, relating the Kapouleas-McGrath construction to the study of
nondegenerate critical points for a Coulomb-type interaction energy. By
analyzing the minimizers of this energy, we prove that, in a generic closed
3-manifold, every two-sided, embedded minimal surface of index one admits a
sequence of minimal doublings. As a corollary, we find that a generic
3-manifold contains an infinite sequence of embedded minimal surfaces with
bounded area and arbitrarily large genus, whose geometry can be described with
some precision.

TL;DR: Liquid crystal films (8CB) show promise as plasma mirrors for laser-plasma accelerator staging, offering high surface quality and stability at 0.5 Hz repetition rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators requires coupling mirrors that can withstand high-intensity laser pulses, which exceed damage thresholds of conventional solid-state optics. Plasma mirrors offer a solution but need high stability and optical quality at matching repetition rates.

Method: Investigating 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal films produced with a new "windmill" film formation device. Testing includes reliability at high repetition rates, reflected beam profile characterization, pointing stability vs. temperature and formation speed, and surface quality measurements using low-power laser reflection.

Result: 8CB LC films demonstrate unprecedented microscopic surface quality crucial for preserving laser pulse properties. Consistent film formation suitable for 0.5 Hz operation with excellent angular stability between films.

Conclusion: 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective plasma mirrors suitable for coupling laser-plasma accelerator stages.

Abstract: Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own
laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies
than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses
for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge
for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser
beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror
surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma
mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from
high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality,
and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the
staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of
4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new
"windmill" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this
investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition
rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a
function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and
surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our
measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic
surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection.
We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with
great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB
LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are
suitable for coupling LPA stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lieb established a lower bound for the smallest Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace operator using a generalized inradius. This work extends similar bounds to other operators and contexts.

Method: The authors propose a method based on Hardy inequalities, which differs from Lieb's original approach, to derive the bounds.

Result: Similar lower bounds are successfully derived for Robin eigenvalues, eigenvalues of the polyharmonic operator, and the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group.

Conclusion: The Hardy inequality-based method provides an alternative and effective approach to extend eigenvalue bounds to various operators beyond the Laplace operator.

Abstract: Lieb has shown a lower bound on the smallest Dirichlet eigenvalue of the
Laplace operator in terms of a generalized inradius. We derive similar bounds
for Robin eigenvalues, for eigenvalues of the polyharmonic operator and the
sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. We propose a method based on Hardy
inequalities that is different from Lieb's approach.

*Chunheng Zhao,Saumil Patel,Hai Lu Lin,Taehun Lee*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Development of a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method with flux bounce-back scheme for accurate single-phase fluid dynamics simulations on unstructured meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate simulations of fluid dynamics in complex geometries using unstructured meshes, overcoming limitations of traditional LBM that requires perfect shift operations.

Method: Combines spectral element method for spatial discretization of convective term, strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta for time integration, and flux bounce-back scheme for complex boundary handling. Uses explicit filtering for stability.

Result: Successfully validated through benchmark simulations including Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, Taylor-Green vortex, and turbulent pipe flow. High-order polynomials eliminate small vortices in sensitive shear layer problems.

Conclusion: The proposed SELBM with FBB scheme provides accurate and stable simulations for complex fluid dynamics problems, demonstrating good convergence and boundary handling capabilities.

Abstract: We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux
bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid
dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the
streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The
spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term,
while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for
time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit
filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer
problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can
effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce
the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex
boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through
benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar
Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex
problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic
turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a
cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.

*Keyan Gootkin,Colby Haggerty,Damiano Caprioli,Zachary Davis*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: This paper studies collisionless plasma turbulence and its role in accelerating ions to cosmic-ray energies through supersonic turbulent motions rather than traditional shock acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how turbulent plasmas in space environments (from Earth's magnetosphere to intergalactic medium) can accelerate particles to high energies, particularly when turbulent motions become supersonic and form shocks that efficiently energize ions.

Method: Used 2.5-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in collisionless plasma with the dHybridR code, analyzing turbulent spectra and ion acceleration.

Result: Found turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of α ≈ -5/3 for low Mach numbers and α ≈ -2 for high Mach numbers. Ions were accelerated to non-thermal energies with efficiencies similar to shocks, producing power-law energy spectra with slope q ≈ 2.5.

Conclusion: Supersonic turbulence can accelerate particles as efficiently as shocks, even without large-scale shock structures, with significant implications for cosmic-ray acceleration theories and astrophysical applications.

Abstract: Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere
to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly
every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of
galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions
can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize
ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic
simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a
collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these
simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by
taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity
field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\alpha \approx
-\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\alpha \approx
-2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations
are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen
in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large
scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a
power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic)
energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and
simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical
implications of this theoretical work.

*Maolin Deng,Bangti Jin*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: This paper proves that the discrete Calderón problem on 3D+ grid graphs has a unique solution, extending previous 2D results using a novel slicing technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators can uniquely identify conductivity values on graph edges in higher-dimensional grid structures, extending classical 2D uniqueness results.

Method: Uses a novel slicing technique that decomposes the higher-dimensional problem into lower-dimensional components, supported by numerical experiments.

Result: Provides an affirmative answer - the discrete DtN operator can uniquely determine conductivity values on edges of 3D+ grid graphs.

Conclusion: Successfully extends the uniqueness result from 2D square lattices to higher-dimensional hypercubic grid graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the slicing approach.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discrete Calder\'{o}n problem on grid graphs
of dimension three or higher, formed by hypercubic structures. The discrete
Calder\'{o}n problem is concerned with determining whether the discrete
Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator, which links boundary potentials to
boundary current responses, can uniquely identify the conductivity values on
the graph edges. We provide an affirmative answer to the question, thereby
extending the classical uniqueness result of Curtis and Morrow for
two-dimensional square lattices. The proof employs a novel slicing technique
that decomposes the problem into lower-dimensional components. Additionally, we
support the theoretical finding with numerical experiments that illustrate the
effectiveness of the approach.
