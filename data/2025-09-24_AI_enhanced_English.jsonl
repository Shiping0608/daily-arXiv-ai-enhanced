The low-rank assumption is key in establishing\na relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The\nlow-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical\noptimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly\n(in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization\napproach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study\nprobabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform\nobservations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern\nexhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient\nalgorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging\nthis structure.

The calculation\nof the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is\nproportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \\varphi $. In previous\nwork, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite\ndifference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the\nstochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are\ninherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise,\nwith the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from,\nwhich introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the\nnoise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that\na PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case\nof a uniform diffusion coefficient.
