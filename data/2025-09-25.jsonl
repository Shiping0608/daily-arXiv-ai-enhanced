To address this issue, optimized Gillespie\nalgorithms were constructed for higher-order structures by means of phantom\nprocesses: events that do not change the state of the system but still account\nfor time progression. We investigate the algorithm's performance considering\nthe susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with critical mass\nthresholds on hypergraphs.
