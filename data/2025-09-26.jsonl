A key challenge lies in\naccurately modeling the frictional contact behavior along fault surfaces. This\nproblem involves inequality constraints that arise from the physics of\nfrictional slip, requiring specialized numerical methods to handle the\nresulting highly nonlinear and path-dependent behavior. In this work, we\naddress this challenge using an augmented Lagrangian method implemented via the\nUzawa algorithm. The formulation employs mixed finite element spaces, combining\nlow-order piecewise linear displacements within the 3D domain cells with\npiecewise constant tractions defined on the fault surfaces. Furthermore, to\nensure stability and satisfy the inf-sup condition, the discrete displacement\nspace is enriched with face bubble functions on both sides of the contact\ninterfaces. This approach offers several advantages over other stabilization\ntechniques that rely on additional terms, as it does not require extra\nparameters for implementation, and it integrates naturally in the Uzawa\nframework."}

The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions\nrepresent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date\nexhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced\nHFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational\nlevels ($v\\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged\n$\\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within\n$1\\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range\nover which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous\nstudies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of\nhigher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic frameworks."}

From inverse problems to numerical\nPDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the\nboundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in\nparallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods\nevolving largely as separate pipelines. With \\emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a\nunifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space\nfor the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in\nthe digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent\nspace governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,\nmodel reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a\nsingle principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of\nLatent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three\nrepresentative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical\nregimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting\nLatent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and\n(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing\nand forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a\ncompact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across\narbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with\nscientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty\nquantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,\ntheory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and\nclassical scientific modeling across disciplines."}

State-of-the-art deep-learning\nor non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with\ntwin-image disturbance.

GSH uses Gaussian splatting\nfor optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown\nparameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase\nretrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities.
