While inverse design techniques typically rely on\nconventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization\nroutines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of\nnanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation\nmethods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the\nvolume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to\ntraditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method\ntailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization\ngradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy\ncompatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our\nVIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in\ncomputational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and\nfrequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we\nsuccessfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective\nmode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter.
