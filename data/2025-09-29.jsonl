Their key advantage lies in\nconstructing a rank-r approximation by sampling only r columns and r rows of\nthe target matrix. This property makes them particularly attractive for\nreduced-order modeling of nonlinear matrix differential equations, where\nnonlinear operations on low-rank matrices can otherwise produce high-rank or\neven full-rank intermediates that must subsequently be truncated to rank $r$.\nCUR cross algorithms bypass the intermediate step and directly form the\nrank-$r$ matrix. However, standard cross algorithms may suffer from loss of\naccuracy in some settings, limiting their robustness and broad applicability.\nIn this work, we propose a cross oversampling algorithm that augments the\nintersection with additional sampled columns and rows. We provide an error\nanalysis demonstrating that the proposed oversampling improves robustness. We\nalso present an algorithm that adaptively selects the number of oversampling\nentries based on efficiently computable indicators. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed CUR algorithm for time integration of several\nnonlinear stochastic PDEs on low-rank matrix manifolds."}
