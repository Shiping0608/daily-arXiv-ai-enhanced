There is also a surprising link: Taking a high-dimensional limit of\nthe right elliptic monotonicity can give a parabolic one as a limit. Poincar\\'e\nwas the first to observe such a connection. We introduce two deficit functions,\none elliptic and one parabolic, then show that the parabolic deficit is\npointwise the limit of the elliptic and, that the elliptic satisfies an\nequation that converges to the equation for the parabolic.
