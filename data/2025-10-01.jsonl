The ACPS combines algebraic\nmanipulation with iterative refinement to achieve greater accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency than mainstream methods. By incorporating principles\nfrom both fractional calculus and functional analysis, the method offers a\nflexible framework capable of addressing a wide range of fractional equations,\nfrom linear to highly nonlinear cases. Additionally, a representative\ncounterexample is provided to indicate that the conformable fractional\nderivative does not fulfill the mathematical criteria for a valid definition of\nfractional differentiation. The Asad Correctional Power Series (ACPS) method is\nemployed to construct an analytic solution of the fractional SIR model in the\nform of a rapidly convergent power series. Its performance is validated through\ncomparisons with the classical fourth-order Runge Kutta method, where both\nnumerical and graphical analyses corroborate the method's precision and\nefficiency. The application of ACPS to the fractional epidemic model highlights\nits ability to capture memory and hereditary effects, offering more realistic\ninsights into disease transmission dynamics than integer-order models.

This\nphenomenon is mathematically formulated as a nonlinear parabolic problem, where\nthe stochastic component is represented as a parameter-dependent datum\ndepending on a non-compact and high-dimensional parameter. In an\n$\\textit{offline}$ phase, we use Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on\nhigh-fidelity samples of the unbounded parameter space.

We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to\npredict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As\na case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific\nOcean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver\npairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed\nprofiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We\nfirst assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate\nphysics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with\nfrequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep\nsigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The\nfinal framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed\nmean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder\nfor bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for\nsource, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer\nthat provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital\ntwin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case\nscenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the\nframework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss\ncombined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates\nfor minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals.

Our analysis relies on the facial reduction technique and the\ncomputation of one-step facial residual functions (1-FRFs). Specifically, under\nappropriate assumptions on the Legendre function, we show that 1-FRFs can be\ntaken to be H\\\"olderian of exponent 1/2 almost everywhere with respect to the\ntwo-dimensional Hausdorff measure. This enables us to further establish that\nhaving a uniform H\\\"olderian error bound with exponent 1/2 is a generic\nproperty for a class of feasibility problems involving these cones."}

Efficient prediction of grade\nintermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining\nsteel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process.\nAmong various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play\na significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices.\nIn this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow\nsimulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During\nthis process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time,\nsignificantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle\nchange time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity\nfull-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally\nexpensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space\nexploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced\norder modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and\nreservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time.\nThe proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive\naccuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less\ncomputational resources and training time.
