The method operates by performing a\nsuccessive comparison of the local DG polynomial's derivatives, from high-order\nto low-order, against a baseline constructed from neighboring cell averages. If\na $k$th-order derivative of the DG polynomial is larger than the baseline,\n  then we reduce the order to $k-1$ and set the corresponding $k$th-order terms\nto be 0; Otherwise, the remaining $k$th-order DG polynomial is used to\nrepresent the final solution.

We prove interior convergence in both the $L^2$ and the Sobolev\n$H^1$ norms at the same rates as in the case of injection/suction normal to the\nboundary. The proof relies on the construction of boundary layer correctors via\nPrandtl-type equations and a higher-order asymptotic expansion that improves\nthe convergence rate."}

The main novelty of this paper is that the\ndomains may be unbounded, including of infinite volume.\n  First, we prove a sharp upper bound for the infimal energy among all\n$k$-partitions by a threshold value which involves the infimum $\\Sigma$ of the\nessential spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the whole domain as well as\nthe infimal energy among all $k-1$-partitions. Strictly below such threshold,\nwe develop a concentration-compactness-type argument showing optimal partitions\nexist, and each cell admits ground states (i.e., the infimum of the spectrum on\neach cell is a simple isolated eigenvalue).\n  Second, for $p<\\infty$, when the energy and the threshold level coincide, we\nshow there may or may not be minimizing partitions. Moreover, even when these\nexist, they may not have ground states.\n  Third, for $p=\\infty$, minimal partitions always exist, even at the threshold\nlevel, but these may or may not admit ground states. Moreover, below the\nthreshold, we can always construct a minimizer, which is an equipartition. At\nthe threshold value we show that spectral minimal partitions may not need to be\nequipartitions.\n  We give a variety of examples of both domains and potentials to illustrate\nthe new phenomena that occur in this setting."}
