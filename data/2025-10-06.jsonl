We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis\ndiffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and\nimmune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering\nultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive\ngas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses\nallowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with\nup to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35\nJ/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to\nefficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence,\nand diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These\ndiffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here\ncould be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may\nenable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for\nnext-generation ultra-high-power lasers."}

It reformulates the crystal\ndetermination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common\nintersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds\nof isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized\nratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods\nin PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The\nelegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates,\nenabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by\ncombining multiple projections.

Admission\nrates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS)\ndistributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and\nclinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing\nmodels or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often\nfall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example\nis the 85\\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization\nbelow this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on\nstationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying\nsystems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are\nmet, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\\% capacity.\n  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an\n$M_t/G_t/\\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates\nand empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical\ndecomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns\nin ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs\n(NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are\nevaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson\noverflow approximations. Results demonstrate the inadequacy of static\nheuristics in environments with fluctuating demand and highlight the importance\nof modeling LOS variability when estimating bed needs. Although the case study\nfocuses on NICUs, the methodology generalizes to other ICU settings and\nprovides interpretable, data-informed support for healthcare systems facing\nrising demand and limited capacity."}
