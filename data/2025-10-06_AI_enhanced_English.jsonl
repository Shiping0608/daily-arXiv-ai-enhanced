Admission\nrates fluctuate over time due to temporal factors, and length of stay (LOS)\ndistributions vary with patient heterogeneity, hospital location, case mix, and\nclinical practices. Common planning approaches rely on steady-state queueing\nmodels or heuristic rules that assume fixed parameters, but these methods often\nfall short in capturing real-world occupancy dynamics. One widely used example\nis the 85\\% occupancy rule, which recommends maintaining average utilization\nbelow this level to ensure responsiveness; however, this rule is based on\nstationary assumptions and may be unreliable when applied to time-varying\nsystems. Our analysis shows that even when long-run utilization targets are\nmet, day-to-day occupancy frequently exceeds 100\\% capacity.\n  We propose a data-driven framework for estimating ICU bed occupancy using an\n$M_t/G_t/\\infty$ queueing model, which incorporates time-varying arrival rates\nand empirically estimated LOS distributions. The framework combines statistical\ndecomposition and parametric distribution fitting to capture temporal patterns\nin ICU admissions and LOS. We apply it to multi-year data from neonatal ICUs\n(NICUs) in Calgary as a case study. Several capacity planning scenarios are\nevaluated, including average-based thresholds and surge estimates from Poisson\noverflow approximations. Results demonstrate the inadequacy of static\nheuristics in environments with fluctuating demand and highlight the importance\nof modeling LOS variability when estimating bed needs. Although the case study\nfocuses on NICUs, the methodology generalizes to other ICU settings and\nprovides interpretable, data-informed support for healthcare systems facing\nrising demand and limited capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a data-driven framework using M_t/G_t/\u221e queueing model for ICU capacity planning, showing static heuristics like 85% occupancy rule are inadequate for time-varying demand.", "motivation": "Hospitals struggle with ICU capacity planning under demand uncertainty.
