Traditional\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches are often limited in\nresolving unsteady flow structures and turbulence in the near and far regions.\nTo address these limitations, hybrid RANS-LES models such as Detached Eddy\nSimulation (DES) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) offer improved performance in\ncapturing near-wall vortical structures. The capturing of turbulent vortices\nand wake structures significantly contributes to conduct hydrodynamic noise\nanalysis. Detailed resolution and understanding of these coherent structures\nhelp minimize hydroacoustic signatures, essential for submarines' stealth\ncharacteristics. Based on prior studies, Breuer et al. (2003) reported that\nRANS failed to capture unsteady vortex shedding, producing only steady results\neven in 3D simulations. In contrast, DES and LES successfully resolved\nasymmetric shedding across different grid resolutions. Spalart (2009) reported\nthat DES is more effective than RANS or LES for high Re flows, although it\nsuffers from challenges related to ambiguous grids and nonmonotonic grid\nrefinement behaviour. Whereas Liang \\& Xue (2014) found that DES predicts tip\nvortex flow characteristics more accurately than RANS-SA and can capture\ncomplex 3D vortex structures. In addition, Guilmineau et al. (2018)\ndemonstrated that the IDDES model accurately predicts recirculation bubbles and\naligns more closely with experimental data for flow prediction. Long et al.\n(2021) confirmed the capability of DDES in simulating cavitating flows around\nhydrofoils and marine propellers. Lungu (2022) highlighted the efficiency and\naccuracy of the hybrid IDDES-SST model in DARPA submarine simulations. Zhang et\nal. (2023) also noted that URANS struggles with resolving small-scale\nturbulence structures, whereas IDDES is better suited for predicting complex\nphenomena such as ship air wake asymmetry. Nevertheless, capturing the\nunsteadiness and turbulence fluctuations scales is extremely challenging\nbecause the cell size requirements should suit each turbulence model employed.\nThus, as a continuation of the prior work of Abidin et al. (2024), the unsteady\nsimulation with high mesh resolution at $U_m=1.8235$ m/s and Re of $3.6\\times\n10^6$ to generate the asymmetrical wake dynamic and vortical structure. The\ncurrent research expands the methodology by parameterizing the meshes and\nnumerical scheme based on Taylor microscale refinement with respect to the\ncharacteristic length of (L, B and D) of submarine, particularly focusing on\nhybrid turbulence model and WALE to observe the ability to resolve turbulence\nin the wake region. The transient simulations were performed initially using\nwall-resolved mesh (76x10^6 cells) at y^+ < 5 and then wall-modelled mesh\n(56x10^6 to 74x10^6 cells) at y^+ > 30, which produced notably different and\nmore detailed results (vortices and turbulence fluctuation) than previous\nsteady-state RANS simulations without risking the accuracy of quantity of\ninterest (global resistance)."}

The spatial discretization is based on a\nfinite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme\nis the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in\nthe Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation.

However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its\nstructure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel\ncontinuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a\ndiscretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this\nformulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local\nintegral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to\na time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational\nperspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the\narchitecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and\nnormalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by\nembedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token\nindices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible\nframework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new\ndirections for architecture design, analysis, and control-based\ninterpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the\ngap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling,\nand contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of\ninterpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models."}

The model equations are derived from a variational\nprinciple, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and\ndriftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a\nfinite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme\nis the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in\nthe Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The\nresulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into\nskew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the\nnon-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based\non discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source\nPython package \\texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the\nenergy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to\nsimulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\\'en\neigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This\ncapability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for\nhigh-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems."}

The\nstarting point is a fixed-point formulation of particle systems originally due\nto Tanaka that allows us to prove mean-field limit and large deviation results\nin an abstract setting. While it has been recently shown that such formulation\nencompasses a large class of exchangeable particle systems, we propose here a\nsetting for the non-exchangeable case, including the case of adaptive\ninteraction networks. We introduce sufficient conditions on the network\nstructure that imply the mean-field limit and a new large deviations principle\nfor the interaction measure. Finally, we formally highlight important models\nfor which it is possible to derive a closed PDE characterization of the limit."}

Our method employs a modified overlapping\nSchwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning\nthe temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving\nHamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is\nensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual\nHamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the\nexponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries\nover to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize\napproach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration\nmethods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value\nsubproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a\nlinear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad\nscientific applications."}

To obtain this condition, a bound is needed for a summation in\nthe transformation equation, which we prove rigorously in the paper.
