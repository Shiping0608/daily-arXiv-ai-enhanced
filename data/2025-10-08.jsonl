This theory is\ncharacterized by an algebraically nonlinear constitutive relationship between\nstress and strain, which intrinsically enforces a limit on the norm of the\nstrain tensor. This approach allows the development of very large stresses, as\nexpected near a crack tip, while ensuring that the corresponding strains remain\nphysically bounded. A loosely coupled system of linear and nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations governing the response of a thermo-mechanical\ntransversely isotropic solid is formulated.

For the Subatomic\nParticle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced\nneutron fluxes of $(3.78 \\pm 0.61_{\\text{sys}}) \\times\n10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(3.97 \\pm 0.65_{\\text{sys}}) \\times\n10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, consistent with empirical depth\nparameterizations. The simulated neutron energy spectra exhibit the expected\nthermal, epithermal, evaporation, and spallation components extending to GeV\nenergies. Electromagnetic backgrounds are expected to dominate the total flux,\nwith $\\gamma$-ray components of $(5.54 \\pm 0.91_{\\text{sys}}) \\times\n10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(6.51 \\pm 1.06_{\\text{sys}}) \\times\n10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I\nfacilities, respectively. These results provide quantitative background\npredictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and\ndeep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and\noverburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra,\nemphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground\nbackground characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made\npublicly available for the broader low-background physics community to enable\nmeaningful inter-facility comparisons."}

The formulation is\nphysically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to\nfluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes,\nwhich are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here\nto area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or\nsurface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and\nimplicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by\nmembrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without\naffecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system\nis monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson\nsolution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging\nexamples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap\nbubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates\nare obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C1-continuous surface\ndiscretizations, for example based on NURBS."}

Here, the random forcing term appears as a mix of a nonlinear noise in\nthe Ito sense and a linear multiplicative noise in the Stratonovich sense. We\nprove the Laplace principle for the family of solutions to the stochastic\nsystem in a suitable Polish space, using the weak convergence framework of\nBudhiraja and Dupuis. This analysis is nontrivial, since it requires uniform\nestimates for the solutions of the associated controlled stochastic equation in\nthe underlying solution space in order to verify the weak convergence\ncriterion. The Wentzell Freidlin type large deviation principle is proved using\nVaradhan's lemma and Bryc's converse to Varadhan's lemma. The local\nwell-posedness of the skeleton equation (deterministic controlled system) is\nestablished by employing the Banach fixed point theorem, and the global well\nposedness is established via Yosida approximation. We show that the\nconservation law holds in the absence of the linear damping and Ito noise. The\nwell posedness of the stochastic controlled equation is also nontrivial in this\ncase. We use a truncation method, a stopping time argument, and the Yosida\ntechnique to get the global well-posedness of the stochastic controlled\nequation."}

Unlike Fourier\nNeural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume\ntranslation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is\nrepresented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling\nis performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design\nenables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on\nfixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an\ninterpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further\nenhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO\nachieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also\nprovide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a\nbounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions.

Unlike the traditional synchrosqueezing transform, TSST\nsqueezes the time-frequency (TF) coefficients along the group delay (GD)\ntrajectories rather than the instantaneous frequency trajectories. Although\nTSST methods perform well in analyzing transient signals, they are\nfundamentally limited in processing multicomponent signals with intersecting GD\ncurves. This limitation compromises the accuracy of both feature extraction and\nsignal component recovery, thereby significantly reducing the interpretability\nof time-frequency representations (TFRs). This is particularly problematic in\nbroadband signal processing systems, where the linearity of the phase response\nis critical and precise measurement of group delay dispersion (GDD) is\nessential.\n  Motivated by the superior capability of frequency-domain signal modeling in\ncharacterizing rapidly frequency-varying signals, this paper proposes a novel\nthree-dimensional time-frequency-group delay dispersion (TF-GDD) representation\nbased on the frequency-domain chirplet transform. A subsequent time-reassigned\nsynchrosqueezing frequency-domain chirplet transform (TSFCT) is introduced to\nachieve a sharper TF-GDD distribution and more accurate GD estimation. For mode\nretrieval, a novel frequency-domain group signal separation operation (FGSSO)\nis proposed.The theoretical contributions include a derivation of the\napproximation error for the GD and GDD reference functions and an establishment\nof the error bounds for FGSSO-based mode retrieval. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed TSFCT and FGSSO effectively estimate GDs and\nretrieve modes--even for modes with intersecting GD trajectories."}
