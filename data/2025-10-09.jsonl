This paper\nstudies RQMC methods for functions with generalized exponential growth\nconditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main\ncontribution of this work is threefold. First, by combining RQMC and importance\nsampling (IS) techniques, we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands\nwith the critical growth condition $e^{A\\|\\boldsymbol{x}\\|^2}$ where $A = 1/2$.\nThis theory extends existing results in the literature, which are limited to\nthe case $A < 1/2$, and we demonstrate that by imposing a light-tail condition\non the proposal distribution in the IS, the RQMC method can maintain its\nhigh-efficiency convergence rate even in this critical growth scenario. Second,\nwe verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling\n(ODIS) satisfy the required light-tail condition, providing rigorous\ntheoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for\ndiscontinuous integrands from finance, we combine the preintegration technique\nwith RQMC-IS. We prove that this integrand after preintegration preserves the\nexponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated discontinuous\nfunctions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS convergence\nframework. Finally, numerical results validate our theory, showing that the\nproposed method is effective in handling these problems with discontinuous\npayoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates."}

Due to the enormous size of the design space,\nevaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible. In this work,\nwe present an end-to-end, fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for topology\noptimization that operates on the exponential Hilbert space representing the\ndesign space. We demonstrate the algorithm on the two-dimensional\nMesserschmitt-B\\\"olkow-Blohm (MBB) beam problem. By restricting design\nvariables to binary values, we reformulate the compliance minimization task as\na combinatorial satisfiability problem solved using Grover's algorithm. Within\nGrover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method\n(FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the\nstiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix\ninversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete\nalgorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit\nsimulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the\ncompliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in\npolynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's\nquadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the\nproposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the\nfield of computational science and engineering."}

Improving\ntheir performance is crucial for developing the next-generation efficient and\ncost effective devices. Topology optimization (TO) has emerged as a powerful\ncomputational tool to design LHTES systems by optimally distributing a\nhigh-conductivity material (HCM) and a phase change material (PCM). However,\nconventional TO typically limits to optimizing the geometry for a fixed,\npre-selected materials. This approach does not leverage the large and expanding\ndatabases of novel materials. Consequently, the co-design of material and\ngeometry for LHTES remains a challenge and unexplored.\n  To address this limitation, we present an automated design framework for the\nconcurrent optimization of material choice and topology. A key challenge is the\ndiscrete nature of material selection, which is incompatible with the\ngradient-based methods used for TO. We overcome this by using a data-driven\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) to project discrete material databases for both\nthe HCM and PCM onto continuous and differentiable latent spaces. These\ncontinuous material representations are integrated into an end-to-end\ndifferentiable, transient nonlinear finite-element solver that accounts for\nphase change. We demonstrate this framework on a problem aimed at maximizing\nthe discharged energy within a specified time, subject to cost constraints. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several illustrative\nexamples."}
