Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the\noptimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially\ntightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better\nsolutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a\nnon-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized\nmini-batch SGD ($\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{c\\beta}{c\\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in\ncentralized and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2c\\beta}{2c\\beta +2}}/{n\nm^{\\frac{1}{2c\\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the\nfirst unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,\nnode count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the\ngeneralization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients\nassumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.\nFinally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical\nfindings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) bridges decentralized and centralized training, reducing performance gaps but cannot fully eliminate them.
