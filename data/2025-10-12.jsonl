Individual steps in the measurement\nprocess are modeled by `single projection operators' $p$. These are line\nintegral operators over a collection of curves that covers the regions of\ninterest. Then, the entire measurement process can be understood as a finite\ncollection of such single projections, and thus be modeled by an\n$N$-projections operator $P=(p_1,\\dots,p_N)$. The most well-known example of an\n$N$-projections operator is the restriction of the Radon transform to finitely\nmany projection angles. Characterizations of the range of $N$-projections\noperators are of intrinsic mathematical interest and can also help in practical\napplications such as geometric calibration, motion detection, or model\nparameter identification. In this work, we investigate the range of projection\npair operators $\\mathcal{P}$ in the plane, i.e., operators formed by two\nprojections ($N=2$) applied to functions in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We find that the\nset of annihilators to $\\mathrm{rg}(\\mathcal{P})$ that are regular\ndistributions contains at most one dimension and a range condition can be\nexplicitly determined by what we refer to as `kernel conditions'. With this\ntool, we examine the exponential fanbeam transform for which no range\nconditions were known, finding that no (regular) range condition exists, and\ntherefore, arbitrary data can be approximated in an $L^2$ sense by projections\nof smooth functions. We also illustrate the use of this theory on a mixed\nparallel-fanbeam projection pair operator."}

Such problems arise\nin many structural engineering applications, but computational solution of\nBayesian inverse problems is often expensive because standard solution\napproaches require many evaluations of the forward model mapping the parameter\nvalue to predicted observations. In many settings, this forward model is\nexpensive because it requires the solution of a high-dimensional discretization\nof a partial differential equation. However, Bayesian inverse problems often\nexhibit low-dimensional structure because the available data are primarily\ninformative (relative to the prior) in a low-dimensional subspace, sometimes\ncalled the likelihood-informed subspace (LIS).

The proposed method projects the governing partial\ndifferential equation onto the likelihood-informed subspace, yielding a\ncomputationally efficient reduced model that can be used to accelerate the\nsolution of the inverse problem.

By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade\nconstitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal\nderivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of\nwavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in\nthe resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure\ntemporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we\ndescribe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the\nresulting time-causal limit kernel.\n  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we\ncharacterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the\ndiscrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet\nrepresentation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures\nin the input signals.\n  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a\nvaluable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be\nprocessed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local\nvariations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing\nphysical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis\nis called for to be physically realistic."}

The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map\nlearning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of\ntrajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This\nrenders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational\nprocess. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and\nanalyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the\nfull DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After\nintroducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction\nand predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nexample: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this\nproblem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs\nare compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit\nknowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs\nyield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing\nfull flow simulations."}
