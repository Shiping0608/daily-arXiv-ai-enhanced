Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a\nsuitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty.\nThe available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further\nintegrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data\nfor training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented\ndatasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in\nparticular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR\napproach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing\naccurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and\navoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints\ninto the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative\npredictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system,\nmaking them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends.

As a result, we characterize related function spaces as K\\\"othe duals\nto a class of Sobolev multiplier type spaces. Moreover, using tools from\nnonlinear potential theory, weighted norm inequalities, and Banach function\nspace theory, we show that these spaces are also isomorphic to more concrete\nspaces that are easy to use and fit in well with the modern theory of function\nspaces of harmonic analysis."}

The classes of systems we study are quite general with a focus on\nconvection-dominated and degenerate parabolic problems. Our a posteriori error\nbounds are valid for a family of discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations\nand various temporal discretizations that include explicit and\nimplicit-explicit time-stepping schemes, popular tools for practical\nsimulations of this class of problem. We prove that our estimators provide\nreliable upper bounds for the error of the numerical method and present\nnumerical evidence showing that they achieve the same order of convergence as\nthe error. Since one of our main interests is the convection dominant case, we\nalso track the dependence of the estimator on the viscosity coefficient."}

This system admits entropic solutions and two types of sound\nwave solutions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing\nvector fields (associated with these waves) is isomorphic to a semidirect sum\nof the infinite-dimensional Abelian real Lie algebra and the non-Abelian\nfinite-dimensional real Lie algebra. Based on this fact, we are able to find a\nparametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows\nfor the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system. It is proven\nthat, in this case, the manifold spanned by the vector fields associated with\nwaves possesses the structure of a local Lie group. It is also shown that this\nmanifold has a torsion-free affine connection and the one-parameter subgroups\nof the Lie group are geodesics. Based on this fact, a description of the\nnon-elastic wave superposition is given in terms of motion of the\nquasi-rectifiable surfaces spanned by the pair of vector fields associated with\nsound waves."}
