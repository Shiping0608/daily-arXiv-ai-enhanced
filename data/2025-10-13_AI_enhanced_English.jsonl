This system admits entropic solutions and two types of sound\nwave solutions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing\nvector fields (associated with these waves) is isomorphic to a semidirect sum\nof the infinite-dimensional Abelian real Lie algebra and the non-Abelian\nfinite-dimensional real Lie algebra.
