While\nsuch missing data typically provokes utilization of tensor completion\nalgorithms, we demonstrate that standard SVD-based compression approaches\n(including the Tucker, Tensor-Train (TT) and Quantized-TT formats) are\nremarkably effective and yield comparable results. We propose a greedy spatial\ndata partitioning algorithm enhancing their performance. We divide the data\ninto the smaller subtensors before compression via exploitation of this trick.\n  Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong temporal dependency in the data's\ncompressibility caused by its nature. Fixing the level of precision we observe\na significant seasonal variation. Investigating this, we find that a temporal\npartitioning on a scale of approximately two days is nearly optimal for all\ntested tensor based formats.

But often the limiter for following\nthe long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical\ntimestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating\nsimulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling\nthis in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then\nprojected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming\nin and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is\nmodulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch\nfactor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches\n(including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and\nensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and\nderive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to\nensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different\nphysics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes\nit possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear\nscale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is\nflexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and\nlimitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these\nmethods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be\nused to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in\nmultiphysics simulations."}

The accuracy of the proposed\nsolution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the\nfinite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier\ninvestigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt\nnumber and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of\nseveral important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio,\ndimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal\nradiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers\nreduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the\nRayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature\ndifference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore,\nincreased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned\nBiot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt\nnumber exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio\nbut increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external\nradiation."}

In the vacuum case, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM)\nspheres and hypersurfaces has been successful in the proof of stability for\nslowly rotating Kerr spacetime. For the charged setting, our companion paper\nintroduced an alternative mass-centered GCM framework, adapted to the\nadditional difficulties of the Einstein-Maxwell system.\n  In this work, we solve the Einstein-Maxwell equations on such a mass-centered\nspacelike GCM hypersurface, which is equivalent to solving the constraint\nequations there. We control all geometric quantities of the solution in terms\nof some seed data, corresponding to the gauge-invariant fields describing\ncoupled gravitational-electromagnetic radiation in perturbations of\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om or Kerr-Newman, first identified by the second author and\nexpected to be governed by favorable hyperbolic equations. This provides the\nfirst step toward controlling gauge-dependent quantities in the nonlinear\nstability analysis of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om and Kerr-Newman families."}

Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that\norgan-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone,\nas traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in\nparticular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute\nand chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by\ncomprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to\nmyocardial growth and remodeling (G&R) processes is yet to be quantified. In\nthis work, we establish a hybrid G&R framework in which we integrate a\nmixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This\nmulti-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative\ncontributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue\nproperties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results\nconfirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the\nmyocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype\nof eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte\nhypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left\nventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an\nimportant step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory\nstages of VO-induced cardiac G&R."}
