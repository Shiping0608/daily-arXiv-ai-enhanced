To address these challenges,\nwe propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,\nwe develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these\nhyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM\nnot only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM\nframework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle\nhigh-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten\nnumerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed\nGFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,\nirregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the\nGFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without\nadditional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results\nconfirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and\nvariable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may\nfurther inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nframeworks."}

The\nscheme preserves positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy\nand a minimum principle of the specific entropy, as well as global properties,\nsuch as total energy balance. The scheme uses an operator splitting approach\ncomposed of two subsystems: the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics\nand a source system. The source system couples the electrostatic potential,\nmomentum, and Lorentz force, thus incorporating electrostatic plasma and\ncyclotron motions. Because of the high-frequency phenomena it describes, the\nsource system is discretized with an implicit time-stepping scheme. We use a\nPDE Schur complement approach for the numerical approximation of the solution\nof the source system. Therefore, it reduces to a single non-symmetric\nPoisson-like problem that is solved for each time step.\n  Our focus with the present work is on the efficient solution of problems\nclose to the magnetic-drift limit. Such asymptotic limit is characterized by\nthe co-existence of slowly moving, smooth flows with very high-frequency\noscillations, spanning timescales that differ by over 10 orders of magnitude,\nmaking their numerical solution quite challenging.\n  We illustrate the capability of the scheme by computing a diocotron\ninstability and present growth rates that compare favorably with existing\nanalytical results.
