### [1] [Structure-preserving finite-element approximations of the magnetic Euler-Poisson equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11808)
*Jordan Hoffart,Matthias Maier,John N. Shadid,Ignacio Tomas*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A structure-preserving numerical scheme for electrostatic Euler-Poisson equations with magnetic field that preserves physical properties and handles multi-scale problems near magnetic-drift limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient numerical methods for plasma physics problems that span vastly different timescales (over 10 orders of magnitude) in the magnetic-drift limit, where smooth flows coexist with high-frequency oscillations.

Method: Operator splitting approach with two subsystems: compressible Euler equations and a source system coupling electrostatic potential, momentum, and Lorentz force. Uses implicit time-stepping for high-frequency source system and PDE Schur complement to reduce to a single non-symmetric Poisson-like problem per time step.

Result: The scheme successfully computes diocotron instability with growth rates matching analytical results. It preserves positivity of density, internal energy, specific entropy minimum principle, and global energy balance.

Conclusion: This model serves as a stepping stone toward electromagnetic solvers capable of working in electrostatic, magnetic-drift, and hydrodynamic regimes, providing a foundation for more comprehensive plasma simulations.

Abstract: We develop a structure-preserving numerical discretization for the
electrostatic Euler-Poisson equations with a constant magnetic field. The
scheme preserves positivity of the density, positivity of the internal energy
and a minimum principle of the specific entropy, as well as global properties,
such as total energy balance. The scheme uses an operator splitting approach
composed of two subsystems: the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics
and a source system. The source system couples the electrostatic potential,
momentum, and Lorentz force, thus incorporating electrostatic plasma and
cyclotron motions. Because of the high-frequency phenomena it describes, the
source system is discretized with an implicit time-stepping scheme. We use a
PDE Schur complement approach for the numerical approximation of the solution
of the source system. Therefore, it reduces to a single non-symmetric
Poisson-like problem that is solved for each time step.
  Our focus with the present work is on the efficient solution of problems
close to the magnetic-drift limit. Such asymptotic limit is characterized by
the co-existence of slowly moving, smooth flows with very high-frequency
oscillations, spanning timescales that differ by over 10 orders of magnitude,
making their numerical solution quite challenging.
  We illustrate the capability of the scheme by computing a diocotron
instability and present growth rates that compare favorably with existing
analytical results. The model, though a simplified version of the
Euler-Maxwell's system, represents a stepping stone toward electromagnetic
solvers that are capable of working in the electrostatic and magnetic-drift
limits, as well as the hydrodynamic regime.

### [2] [Recovery of Integer Images from Limited DFT Measurements with Lattice Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11949)
*Howard W Levinson,Isaac Viviano*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper shows that integer-valued images can be uniquely reconstructed from a limited subset of DFT coefficients, developing theoretical bounds and efficient algorithms using dynamic programming and lattice methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DFT reconstruction requires all coefficients, but the prior knowledge that images contain only integer values enables unique recovery from fewer measurements, reducing data requirements.

Method: Uses algebraic properties of DFT to reduce 2D recovery to 1D problems, develops dynamic programming reconstruction with lattice-based methods (LLL algorithm) to solve NP-hard subproblems efficiently.

Result: Characterizes minimum number and location of DFT coefficients needed for unique reconstruction, provides practical algorithms that successfully recover large integer images with reduced search space.

Conclusion: Integer-valued images can be uniquely reconstructed from minimal DFT measurements using the proposed reduction framework and lattice-based algorithms, making the approach both theoretically sound and practically feasible.

Abstract: Exact reconstruction of an image from measurements of its Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) typically requires all DFT coefficients to be available.
However, incorporating the prior assumption that the image contains only
integer values enables unique recovery from a limited subset of DFT
coefficients. This paper develops both theoretical and algorithmic foundations
for this problem. We use algebraic properties of the DFT to define a reduction
from two-dimensional recovery to several well-chosen one-dimensional
recoveries. Our reduction framework characterizes the minimum number and
location of DFT coefficients that must be sampled to guarantee unique
reconstruction of an integer-valued image. Algorithmically, we develop
reconstruction procedures which use dynamic programming to efficiently recover
an integer signal or image from its minimal set of DFT measurements. While the
new inversion algorithms still involve NP-hard subproblems, we demonstrate how
the divide-and-conquer approach drastically reduces the associated search
space. To solve the NP-hard subproblems, we employ a lattice-based framework
which leverages the LLL approximation algorithm to make the algorithms fast and
practical. We provide an analysis of the lattice method, suggesting approximate
parameter choices to ensure correct inversion. Numerical results for the
algorithms support the parameter analysis and demonstrate successful recovery
of large integer images.

### [4] [Monte Carlo quasi-interpolation of spherical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12027)
*Zhengjie Sun,Mengyuan Lv,Xingping Sun*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A deterministic and stochastic spherical quasi-interpolation framework using scaled zonal kernels from radial basis functions, incorporating quasi-Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo quadrature for efficient approximation of Sobolev-space functions with clean and noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient and robust approximation methods for functions on spheres that work well with both clean and noisy data, without requiring linear system solutions.

Method: Uses scaled zonal kernels from radial basis functions, incorporates quasi-Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo quadrature rules, and develops a multilevel method with graded resolutions to enhance approximation power and robustness.

Result: The quasi-interpolation algorithm is more stable and robust against noise than comparable methods in literature, with probabilistic concentration inequalities derived for stochastic settings.

Conclusion: The proposed spherical quasi-interpolation framework provides efficient, stable, and noise-robust approximation without requiring linear system solutions, outperforming existing comparable methods.

Abstract: We establish a deterministic and stochastic spherical quasi-interpolation
framework featuring scaled zonal kernels derived from radial basis functions on
the ambient Euclidean space. The method incorporates both quasi-Monte Carlo and
Monte Carlo quadrature rules to construct easily computable quasi-interpolants,
which provide efficient approximation to Sobolev-space functions for both clean
and noisy data. To enhance the approximation power and robustness of our
quasi-interpolants, we develop a multilevel method in which quasi-interpolants
constructed with graded resolutions join force to reduce the error of
approximation. In addition, we derive probabilistic concentration inequalities
for our quasi-interpolants in pertinent stochastic settings. The construction
of our quasi-interpolants does not require solving any linear system of
equations. Numerical experiments show that our quasi-interpolation algorithm is
more stable and robust against noise than comparable ones in the literature.

### [5] [Stochastic Finite Volume Approximation with Clustering in the Parameter Space for Forward Uncertainty Quantification of PDEs with Random Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12109)
*Zhao Zhang,Na Ou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new stochastic finite volume method extension using parameter space clustering for uncertainty quantification in PDEs with random parameters, enabling higher-dimensional parameter spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uncertainty quantification for PDEs with random parameters by extending stochastic finite volume methods to handle higher-dimensional parameter spaces through clustering techniques.

Method: Extends stochastic finite volume method by clustering samples in parameter space instead of using structured grids, applied to parametric elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations for Darcy flows.

Result: The new clustering-based SFV scheme successfully handles higher-dimensional parameter spaces and is validated through typical reservoir simulation test cases.

Conclusion: Parameter space clustering effectively extends stochastic finite volume methods to higher dimensions, providing improved uncertainty quantification capabilities for PDEs with random parameters.

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification (UQ) for partial differential equations (PDEs)
with random parameters is important for science and engineering. Forward UQ
quantifies the impact of random parameters on the solution or the
quantity-of-interest (QoI). In the current study, we propose a new extension of
the stochastic finite volume (SFV) method by clustering samples in the
parameter space. Compared to classic SFV based on structured grid in the
parameter space, the new scheme based on clustering extends SFV to parameter
spaces of higher dimensions. This paper presents the construction of SFV
schemes for typical parametric elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations for
Darcy flows in porous media, as well as the error analysis, demonstration and
validation of the new extension using typical reservoir simulation test cases.

### [6] [A priori error estimates for stable generalized finite element discretization of parabolic interface optimal control problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12147)
*Xindan Zhang,Jianping Zhao,Yanren Hou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Optimal control of parabolic interface problems with interface control using stable generalized FEM and backward Euler scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FEM fails to achieve optimal convergence rates for parabolic interface problems due to low global regularity caused by coefficient jumps and interface control.

Method: Fully discrete approximations using stable generalized FEM for spatial discretization, backward Euler for temporal discretization, and variational discretization for control variable.

Result: A priori error estimates are proven for control, state, and adjoint state variables.

Conclusion: Numerical examples validate the theoretical error estimates, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method for parabolic interface control problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate optimal control problems governed by the
parabolic interface equation, in which the control acts on the interface. The
solution to this problem exhibits low global regularity due to the jump of the
coefficient across the interface and the control acting on the interface.
Consequently, the traditional finite element method fails to achieve optimal
convergence rates when using a uniform mesh. To discretize the problem, we use
fully discrete approximations based on the stable generalized finite element
method for spatial discretization and the backward Euler scheme for temporal
discretization, as well as variational discretization for the control variable.
We prove a priori error estimates for the control, state, and adjoint state.
Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical findings.

Method: Complete analysis for Poisson interface model using tailored dual problem that restores adjoint consistency

Result: Derived desired error bounds in L² norm

Conclusion: Successfully established optimal error estimates through tailored dual problem approach

Abstract: This paper establishes optimal error estimates in the $L^2$ for the
non-symmetric Nitsche method in an unfitted interface finite element setting.
Extending our earlier work, we give a complete analysis for the Poisson

adjoint consistency, derive the desired bounds.

### [8] [Spatial two-grid compact difference scheme for two-dimensional nonlinear diffusion-wave equations with variable exponent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12188)
*Hao Zhang,Kexin Li,Wenlin Qiu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A spatial two-grid compact difference scheme for 2D nonlinear diffusion-wave equations with variable exponents, using convolution approach and efficient two-grid algorithm with proven stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for modeling mechanical diffusive waves in viscoelastic media with varying material properties, addressing the computational challenges of nonlinear diffusion-wave equations with variable exponents.

Method: Uses convolution approach to transform the model, applies compact difference approximation in space, combines averaged product integration with linear interpolation in time, and implements a two-grid algorithm with bicubic spline interpolation between coarse and fine grids.

Result: The proposed STG compact difference scheme demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency through numerical experiments, with rigorous mathematical proof of stability and convergence under mild assumptions on the variable exponent.

Conclusion: The spatial two-grid compact difference scheme provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for solving 2D nonlinear diffusion-wave equations with variable exponents, validated through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a spatial two-grid (STG) compact difference scheme for a
two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear diffusion-wave equation with variable exponent,
which describes, e.g., the propagation of mechanical diffusive waves in
viscoelastic media with varying material properties. Following the idea of the
convolution approach, the diffusion-wave model is first transformed into an
equivalent formulation. A fully discrete scheme is then developed by applying a
compact difference approximation in space and combining the averaged product
integration rule with linear interpolation quadrature in time. An efficient
high-order two-grid algorithm is constructed by solving a small-scale nonlinear
system on the coarse grid and a large-scale linearized system on the fine grid,
where the bicubic spline interpolation operator is used to project coarse-grid
solutions to the fine grid. Under mild assumptions on the variable exponent
$\alpha(t)$, the stability and convergence of the STG compact difference scheme
are rigorously established. Numerical experiments are finally presented to
verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

### [9] [Fully mixed virtual element schemes for steady-state poroelastic stress-assisted diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12307)
*Isaac Bermudez,Bryan Gomez-Vargas,Andres E. Rubiano,Ricardo Ruiz-Baier*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A fully mixed virtual element method for coupling stress-altered diffusion and linear elasticity with strong symmetry of total poroelastic stress, using less restrictive assumptions on diffusion coefficients and Banach space analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust numerical method for poroelasticity problems that handles stress-altered diffusion with weaker assumptions on diffusion coefficients, requiring Banach space analysis.

Method: Fully mixed virtual element method using Hellinger-Reissner principle, with analysis of perturbed diffusion equation in Banach spaces and modification of abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point problems.

Result: Established solvability of continuous and discrete problems, derived optimal a priori error estimates, and demonstrated robustness with respect to poromechanical parameters through numerical examples.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully handles stress-altered diffusion in poroelasticity with less restrictive assumptions, provides theoretical guarantees, and shows practical effectiveness through numerical validation.

Abstract: We propose a fully mixed virtual element method for the numerical
approximation of the coupling between stress-altered diffusion and linear
elasticity equations with strong symmetry of total poroelastic stress (using
the Hellinger--Reissner principle). A novelty of this work is that we introduce
a less restrictive assumption on the stress-assisted diffusion coefficient,
requiring an analysis of the perturbed diffusion equation using Banach spaces.
The solvability of the continuous and discrete problems is established using a
suitable modification of the abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point
problems in Banach spaces (which is in itself a new result of independent
interest). In addition, we establish optimal a priori error estimates. The
method and its analysis are robust with respect to the poromechanical
parameters. We also include a number of numerical examples that illustrate the
properties of the proposed scheme.

### [10] [On the maximum bound principle and energy dissipation of exponential time differencing methods for the chiral liquid crystal blue phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12499)
*Wenshuai Hu,Guanghua Ji*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Development of first and second order exponential time differencing schemes for simulating chiral liquid crystal blue phases, preserving energy dissipation and maximum bound principle with Fourier spectral spatial discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blue phases in chiral liquid crystals are complex states that can be modeled using Landau-de Gennes theory, requiring numerical methods that preserve physical properties like energy dissipation and maximum bound principle.

Method: Developed first and second order exponential time differencing schemes coupled with Fourier spectral method in space, using a novel matrix-form Helmholtz basis transformation to diagonalize combined Laplacian and curl operators.

Result: The schemes preserve maximum bound principle and energy dissipation unconditionally at semi-discrete level, with proven L∞ boundedness of numerical solutions and error estimates in L² and L∞ norms.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for simulating blue phase dynamics in chiral liquid crystals.

Abstract: The blue phases are fascinating and complex states of chiral liquid crystals
which can be modeled by a comprehensive framework of the Landau-de theory,
satisfying energy dissipation and maximum bound principle.
  In this paper, we develop and analyze first and second order exponential time
differencing numerical schemes for the gradient flow of the chiral liquid
crystal blue phases, which preserve the maximum bound principle and energy
dissipation unconditionally at the semi-discrete level.
  The fully discrete schemes are obtained coupled with the Fourier spectral
method in space.
  And we propose a novel matrix-form Helmholtz basis transformation method to
diagonalize the combined operator of the Laplacian and the curl operator, which
is a key step in the implementation of the proposed schemes.
  Then by constructing auxiliary functions, we drive the $L^\infty$ boundedness
of the numerical solutions and obtain the energy dissipation and the error
estimates in $L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norm.
  Various numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical
results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in simulating
the dynamics of blue phases in chiral liquid crystals.

### [11] [Why the noise model matters: A performance gap in learned regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12521)
*Sebastian Banert,Christoph Brauer,Dirk Lorenz,Lionel Tondji*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper analyzes learned regularization methods for linear inverse problems, comparing them against the optimal affine reconstruction benchmark. It shows that without accurate noise covariance information, a performance gap emerges between learned methods and the optimal solution, highlighting the importance of noise modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practical inverse problems involve unknown noise statistics, making it challenging to achieve optimal regularization performance. The paper aims to understand how different learned regularization methods perform when noise information is unavailable.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments comparing Tikhonov, Lavrentiev, and quadratic regularization methods learned without noise covariance information, benchmarked against the optimal affine reconstruction.

Result: For non-white noise, a performance gap emerges between learned regularization methods and the optimal affine reconstruction. Different regularization types yield distinct results, showing that regularizer structure choice is critical when noise models aren't learned.

Conclusion: Accurately modeling or co-learning noise statistics is crucial for effective data-driven regularization in linear inverse problems, as performance degrades significantly without proper noise information.

Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of learning effective regularizers for
linear inverse problems. We analyze and compare several types of learned
variational regularization against the theoretical benchmark of the optimal
affine reconstruction, i.e. the best possible affine linear map for minimizing
the mean squared error. It is known that this optimal reconstruction can be
achieved using Tikhonov regularization, but this requires precise knowledge of
the noise covariance to properly weight the data fidelity term. However, in
many practical applications, noise statistics are unknown. We therefore
investigate the performance of regularization methods learned without access to
this noise information, focusing on Tikhonov, Lavrentiev, and quadratic
regularization. Our theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate
that for non-white noise, a performance gap emerges between these methods and
the optimal affine reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that these different
types of regularization yield distinct results, highlighting that the choice of
regularizer structure is critical when the noise model is not explicitly
learned. Our findings underscore the significant value of accurately modeling
or co-learning noise statistics in data-driven regularization.

### [12] [Easy-to-Implement One-Step Schemes for Stochastic Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12583)
*J. Woodfield,A. Lobbe*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Developed stochastic integration methods based on deterministic one-step techniques, creating SETDRK, SIFRK and SRK schemes that require minimal modifications to existing deterministic schemes and converge to Stratonovich SDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create convenient, easy-to-implement stochastic integration methods that can be easily adapted from existing deterministic schemes while maintaining desirable properties.

Method: Used abstract one-step deterministic order p integration techniques to develop stochastic exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (SETDRK), stochastic integrating factor Runge-Kutta (SIFRK) and stochastic RK (SRK) schemes.

Result: Schemes capture all symmetric terms in Stratonovich-Taylor expansion, are order p in vanishing noise limit, attain strong order p/2 or p/2-1/2 for drift commutative noise, strong order 1 for commutative noise, and strong order 1/2 for multidimensional non-commutative noise.

Conclusion: Numerical convergence demonstrated using different noise bases for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order SETDRK, SIFRK and SRK schemes applied to stochastic KdV equation, showing practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Convenient, easy to implement stochastic integration methods are developed on
the basis of abstract one-step deterministic order $p$ integration techniques.
The abstraction as an arbitrary one step map allows the inspection of easy to
implement stochastic exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta (SETDRK),
stochastic integrating factor Runge-Kutta (SIFRK) and stochastic RK (SRK)
schemes. Such schemes require minimal modifications to existing deterministic
schemes and converging to the Stratonovich SDE, whilst inheriting many of their
desirable properties.
  These schemes capture all symmetric terms in the Stratonovich-Taylor
expansion, are order $p$ in the limit of vanishing noise, can attain at least
strong order $p/2$ or $p/2-1/2$ (parity dependent) for drift commutative noise,
strong order $1$ for commutative noise, and strong order $1/2$ for
multidimensional non-commutative noise. Numerical convergence is demonstrated
using different bases of noise for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order SETDRK, SIFRK and SRK
schemes for a stochastic KdV equation.

*Lamsahel Noureddine,Abdeladim El Akri,Ahmed Ratnani*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analysis of Galerkin isogeometric discretization for 1D Laplace eigenvalue problem using GLT theory to study eigenfrequency behavior under domain reparametrization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how domain reparametrization affects eigenfrequency distribution in isogeometric analysis of Laplace eigenvalue problems.

Method: Employ GLT theory to analyze eigenfrequencies under reparametrization transformations, with suitable assumptions on the transformation.

Result: Proved structured pattern emerges in eigenfrequency distribution, established uniform discrete Weyl's law, and derived eigenfrequency estimates showing symbol's asymptotically linear behavior near zero.

Conclusion: GLT-symbol analysis reveals systematic patterns in eigenfrequency distribution under domain reparametrization, extending previous results with refined estimates.

Abstract: This work addresses the Galerkin isogeometric discretization of the
one-dimensional Laplace eigenvalue problem subject to homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions on a bounded interval. We employ GLT theory to analyze the
behavior of the eigenfrequencies when a reparametrization is applied to the
computational domain. Under suitable assumptions on the reparametrization
transformation, we prove that a structured pattern emerges in the distribution
of eigenfrequencies when the problem is reframed through GLT-symbol analysis.
Additionally, we establish results that refine and extend those of [3],
including a uniform discrete Weyl's law. Furthermore, we derive several
eigenfrequency estimates by establishing that the symbol exhibits
asymptotically linear behavior near zero.

### [14] [Log-free estimate of the full nonlinearity in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations outside the diagonal regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11729)
*Pylyp Cherevan*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of off-diagonal nonlinear contributions in 3D Navier-Stokes equations using integration by parts, Strichartz estimates, and bilinear decoupling to achieve a priori estimates without logarithmic losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the contribution of full nonlinearity outside the narrow diagonal zone in 3D Navier-Stokes equations, particularly off-diagonal components and resonant blocks.

Method: Six-fold integration by parts with phase analysis, local Strichartz estimates on cylinders, bilinear epsilon-free decoupling in folded geometry, and heat reduction with globalization techniques.

Result: Achieved a priori estimate without logarithmic losses in L^1_t H^-1_x norm over zone |xi + eta| >= N^(1-delta) for delta in (1/3, 5/8], with phase reserve stability.

Conclusion: The combined analytical framework successfully handles off-diagonal nonlinear contributions in Navier-Stokes equations, providing improved estimates through careful phase analysis and decoupling techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the full nonlinearity outside the narrow
diagonal zone in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. We consider the
off-diagonal components, including lh, hl, as well as part of the resonant
block hh -> l for |xi + eta| >= N^(1-delta). The proof relies on three main
elements: (i) six-fold integration by parts in the phase Phi(t,x,xi,eta) =
x*(xi + eta) + 4trho1rho2 with respect to (t,rho1,rho2); on the window |t| <=
N^(-1/2) the phase Hessian A = nabla^2_(t,rho1,rho2) Phi is non-degenerate and
provides a reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta); (ii) local Strichartz estimates
on cylinders of scale N^(-1/2); in Sec. 4 a strengthened version is used to
combine with the decoupling scheme, while the unconditional framework is based
on heat reduction (App. D) and globalization (App. E); and (iii) bilinear
epsilon-free decoupling in folded geometry of rank 4 (Appendix B), yielding a
gain of N^(-1/4) for angular tiles of width N^(-1/2). For the narrow corona,
suppression of the null-form type symbol is realized when delta > 1/2; for the
block hh -> h with output projection P_N this mechanism is not required and is
accounted for separately (see App. E.6). The combined count yields an a priori
estimate without logarithmic losses in the norm L^1_t H^-1_x over the whole
zone |xi + eta| >= N^(1 - delta) for delta in (1/3, 5/8]; the upper bound is
imposed by the stability of the phase reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta) >> 1 on
the window |t| <= N^(-1/2). The full scheme and navigation through the sections
are given in the text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish complete scattering theory and dispersive properties for general one-dimensional charge transfer models (Schrödinger equations with multiple moving potentials), building on previous work that had limitations.

Method: Developed a refined structure for constructing distorted Fourier transforms adapted to the multi-potential framework, which allows removal of the large-velocity separation assumption from previous work.

Result: Successfully removed the large-velocity separation assumption, completing the full scattering theory and dispersive analysis for general one-dimensional charge transfer models.

Conclusion: The established dispersive estimates provide the foundation for analyzing asymptotic stability and collision phenomena for multi-solitons in a general setting.

Abstract: We continue our study of scattering theory and dispersive properties for
one-dimensional charge transfer models, namely linear Schr\"odinger equations
with multiple moving potentials. By the discovery of a refined structure of the
construction of distorted Fourier transforms adapted to the multi-potential
framework, we remove the large-velocity separation assumption imposed in [8].
This work thus completes the full scattering theory and dispersive analysis for
general one-dimensional charge transfer models. These dispersive estimates
provide the foundation for analyzing asymptotic stability and collision
phenomena for multi-solitons in a general setting.

### [16] [On ill-posedness for the Gabitov--Turitsyn equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11887)
*Matthew Kowalski*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes well- and ill-posedness of the Gabitov-Turitsyn equation for optical fiber pulse dynamics, identifying two critical regularity thresholds that separate different regimes of behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mathematical properties of the Gabitov-Turitsyn equation, which models pulse dynamics in dispersion-managed optical fibers, by identifying critical regularity thresholds that demarcate well-posed and ill-posed regimes.

Method: The authors identify two critical regularities s_m and s_i based on scaling pseudo-symmetries, then analyze the data-to-solution map behavior and prove norm inflation results in different regularity regimes, including establishing energy equipartition for certain cases.

Result: For s ≥ max(s_m,0), local well-posedness holds in H^s, while for s < s_m, the data-to-solution map fails to be C^{p+1}. For s < min(s_i,0) and 1 ≤ s < s_i, norm inflation is proven, and for s_i ≥ 1, norm inflation occurs through energy equipartition - rapid renormalization of kinetic and potential energy.

Conclusion: The paper establishes precise critical regularity thresholds that separate different regimes of well-posedness and ill-posedness for the Gabitov-Turitsyn equation, with particular focus on norm inflation phenomena and energy equipartition mechanisms in the ill-posed regimes.

Abstract: We investigate the well- and ill-posedness theory for the Gabitov--Turitsyn
equation, which models the long-time dynamics of pulses in dispersion-managed
optical fibers. We identify two critical regularities, corresponding to two
scaling pseudo-symmetries, that demarcate regimes of ill-posedness. First, we
identify $s_m = \tfrac{d}{2} - \tfrac{2}{p},$ coinciding with the monomial NLS.
For $s \geq \max(s_m,0)$, local well-posedness is known to hold in $H^s$, while
for $s < s_m$, we show that the data-to-solution map fails to be $C^{p+1}$ in
$H^s$. Second, we identify $s_i = \tfrac{d}{2} - \tfrac{4}{p},$ below which we
conjecture that norm inflation occurs. We resolve this conjecture in $H^s$ in
the case $s < \min (s_i, 0)$ -- specifically for the one-dimensional cubic
model -- and in the case $1 \leq s < s_i$. In the case $s_i \geq 1$, we
establish norm inflation by showing that suitable solutions undergo {\em energy
equipartition}: a rapid renormalization of kinetic and potential energy.

*Lia Bronsard,Benoît Merlet,Marc Pegon*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Generalized liquid drop models with screened Riesz-type interactions (truncated Coulomb/Yukawa) can have non-spherical minimizers, unlike the classical Gamow model which only has spherical minimizers below critical mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the classical conjecture about spherical minimizers in Gamow's liquid drop model holds for screened interactions, and to find evidence of non-spherical minimizers in repulsive radial kernels.

Method: Comparison of energy-per-mass ratios between balls and cylinders for truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials, using analytical approaches rather than Γ-convergence methods.

Result: Found existence of non-spherical minimizers for some screening parameter values in truncated Coulomb/Yukawa cases, providing first evidence of such minimizers in 3D repulsive radial kernels.

Conclusion: The classical conjecture fails for screened interactions, while remaining consistent for unscreened Riesz cases where ball and cylinder energy ratios are surprisingly close.

Abstract: We investigate generalized liquid drop models with screened Riesz-type
interactions, focusing in particular on truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials
in three dimensions. While the classical Gamow model with Coulomb interaction
is conjectured to admit only spherical minimizers below a critical mass and no
minimizer above, we show that this conjecture fails if the interaction is
screened. In the case of truncated Coulomb and Yukawa potentials, we establish
the existence of non-spherical minimizers for some values of the screening
parameter. This gives the first evidence of such minimizers in the class of
repulsive, radial, and radially nonincreasing kernels in three dimensions. Our
approach relies on a comparison of the energy-per-mass ratios of balls and
cylinders, in contrast with recent two-dimensional results obtained via
$\Gamma$-convergence. We further show that in the unscreened Riesz case, the
conjecture remains consistent, though delicate. Indeed we observe that the
energy-per-mass ratios of balls and of cylinders are surprisingly close.

TL;DR: The paper presents new contractivity estimates and exponential convergence rates for hypoelliptic diffusion equations like Kolmogorov and kinetic Fokker-Planck equations, using an elementary approach based on oscillation estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative, self-contained proof method for contractivity and convergence in hypoelliptic diffusion equations, different from existing literature approaches.

Method: Uses oscillation estimates for the adjoint problem, Wasserstein distance contractivity via doubling variables/coupling methods, and upgrades to weighted L^1 norms using short-time hypocoercivity gradient estimates.

Result: Proves long-time contractivity estimates and exponential convergence rates to equilibrium for solutions of hypoelliptic diffusion equations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes contractivity and convergence results through an elementary, self-contained approach that differs from previous methods in the literature.

Abstract: We prove long-time contractivity estimates and exponential rates of
convergence to equilibrium for solutions of hypoelliptic diffusion equations,
which include the well-known Kolmogorov equation and similar kinetic
Fokker-Planck equations in $\R^d$. Compared to the existing literature, our
proof exploits a different approach, elementary and self-contained, based on
oscillation estimates for the adjoint problem. We first prove contractivity in
Wasserstein distances through doubling variables (coupling) methods. Next, we
upgrade the estimate to weighted $L^1$-(or total variation) norms, thanks to
short-time hypocoercivity gradient estimates.

TL;DR: The paper presents a decomposition method for steady MHD equations in parallel magnetic field and flow velocity scenarios, establishing existence and stability of super-Alfvénic cylindrical transonic shock solutions under 3D perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity in magnetohydrodynamic equations caused by Alfvén waves and coupled motion between hydrodynamic flow and magnetic field, particularly in transonic shock scenarios.

Method: Developed an effective decomposition of steady MHD equations using deformation tensor and modified vorticity that accounts for Lorentz force effects, analyzed within parallel magnetic field and flow velocity framework.

Result: Successfully established existence and structural stability of super-Alfvénic cylindrical transonic shock solutions under three-dimensional perturbations of incoming flow and exit total pressure.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition method effectively handles MHD complexity and demonstrates robust stability properties for transonic shock solutions in magnetohydrodynamic systems.

Abstract: The coupled motion between the hydrodynamic flow and magnetic field
introduces significant complexity into the structure of the magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations. A key factor contributing to this complexity is the presence
of Alfv\'en waves, which critically influences the character of the flow and
makes the problem considerably more challenging. Within the framework where the
magnetic field is everywhere parallel to the flow velocity, we give an
effective decomposition of the steady MHD equations in terms of the deformation
tensor and the modified vorticity, where the modification in the vorticity is
to record the effect of the Lorentz force on the velocity field. The existence
and structural stability of the super-Alfv\'{e}nic cylindrical transonic shock
solutions for the steady MHD equations are established under three-dimensional
perturbations of the incoming flow and the exit total pressure (kinetic plus
magnetic).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study scattering phenomena in periodic media with strong material contrast, which induces subwavelength resonances and requires effective modeling approaches.

Method: Derive frequency-dependent effective model in vanishing-period limit, prove quantitative convergence of heterogeneous scattered wave to effective scattered wave, identify limiting scattering resonances.

Result: Established convergence rates for the scattered wave and far-field pattern from heterogeneous problem to effective model, identified limiting set of scattering resonances.

Conclusion: Effective models accurately capture scattering behavior in high-contrast periodic media with small periods, with proven convergence rates for both near-field and far-field patterns.

Abstract: We study time-harmonic scattering by a periodic array of penetrable,
high-contrast obstacles with small period, confined to a bounded Lipschitz
domain. The strong contrast between the obstacles and the background induces
subwavelength resonances. We derive a frequency-dependent effective model in
the vanishing-period limit and prove quantitative convergence of the
heterogeneous scattered wave to the effective scattered wave. We also identify
the limiting set of scattering resonances and establish convergence rates.
Finally, we establish convergence rates for the far-field pattern of the
heterogeneous problem to that of the effective model.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equation and proves that its energy dissipation rate remains finite in the vanishing viscosity limit, consistent with Kolmogorov's theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study statistical properties of turbulence using stochastic PDEs, since statistical quantities are more informative than pointwise characterizations for chaotic turbulent flows.

Method: Analysis of the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equation driven by space-time Gaussian noise on a three-dimensional periodic domain, deriving rigorous upper bounds on the first moment of energy dissipation rate.

Result: The first moment of energy dissipation rate remains finite in the vanishing viscosity limit, which aligns with Kolmogorov's phenomenological theory and classical Navier-Stokes results.

Conclusion: The model does not over-dissipate energy in the absence of boundary layers, demonstrating consistency with established turbulence theories.

Abstract: Due to the chaotic nature of turbulence, statistical quantities are often
more informative than pointwise characterizations. In this work, we consider
the stochastic Ladyzhenskaya-Smagorinsky equation driven by space-time Gaussian
noise on a three-dimensional periodic domain. We derive a rigorous upper bound
on the first moment of the energy dissipation rate and show that it remains
finite in the vanishing viscosity limit, consistent with Kolmogorov's
phenomenological theory. This estimate also agrees with classical results
obtained for the Navier-Stokes equations and demonstrates that, in the absence
of boundary layers, as considered here, the model does not over-dissipate.

*Daisuke Kawagoe*

TL;DR: Study of discontinuities in stationary transport equations, showing that without generalized convexity, coefficient-induced discontinuities appear but don't affect inverse X-ray transform reconstruction of attenuation coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand different types of discontinuities in stationary transport equations and their impact on inverse problems, particularly when the generalized convexity condition is not satisfied.

Method: Mathematical analysis of stationary transport equations with incoming boundary conditions, examining propagation of boundary-induced and coefficient-induced discontinuities along characteristic lines.

Result: Coefficient-induced discontinuities appear without generalized convexity but don't affect inverse X-ray transform reconstruction; 3D inverse problems can be reduced to 2D under convexity condition.

Conclusion: The inverse X-ray transform remains valid for reconstructing attenuation coefficients even when coefficient-induced discontinuities are present, provided the coefficient discontinuities have finite flat parts.

Abstract: We consider the stationary transport equation with the incoming boundary
condition. We are interested in discontinuities of the solution. Under the
generalized convexity condition, it is known that it has only boundary-induced
discontinuities, which are discontinuities arising from discontinuous boundary
data, they propagate along positive characteristic lines, and we can
reconstruct the attenuation coefficient from boundary measurements by the
inverse X-ray transform. In this article, we observe that coefficient-induced
discontinuities, discontinuities of the solution arising from discontinuous
coefficients, would also appear without the generalized convexity condition. If
the set of discontinuous points of the coefficients contains at most finite
number of flat parts, coefficient-induced discontinuities do not affect the
inverse X-ray transform. We also remark that, under the generalized convexity
condition, a three dimensional inverse problem can be reduced to the two
dimensional one. A numerical experiment is exhibited.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Harnack inequalities from the classical case (p=2) to mixed local and nonlocal p-energy forms, addressing cases with killing parts in the energy form.

Method: Uses De Giorgi-Nash-Moser method, relying on Poincaré inequality, cutoff Sobolev inequality, and mild conditions on jump measure.

Result: Successfully derives both weak and strong elliptic Harnack inequalities for mixed local and nonlocal p-energy forms.

Conclusion: The approach effectively extends previous results for Dirichlet forms without killing parts to the more general p-energy case with mixed local and nonlocal components.

Abstract: We derive the weak elliptic Harnack inequality and the elliptic Harnack
inequality for mixed local and nonlocal $p$-energy form on metric measure
spaces. The proof relies on the Poincar\'e inequality, the cutoff Sobolev

TL;DR: First large-data, symmetry-free proof of dynamical black hole formation for Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1 dimensions, establishing semi-global existence and trapped surface formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter without symmetry assumptions, addressing the delicate interaction between geometric and kinetic structures in strong gravitational regimes.

Method: Hierarchy of estimates for Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments; refined renormalization of Ricci coefficients; strategic restriction of elliptic estimates; precise commutator calculus adapted to mass-shell geometry.

Result: Successful construction of dynamical black hole formation without symmetry assumptions, overcoming analytic challenges from Vlasov field including integrability and regularity issues.

Conclusion: Framework provides first symmetry-free construction of dynamical black hole formation with kinetic matter and has broader applications, including potential use in proving nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with massless Vlasov matter.

Abstract: We prove a large-data semi-global existence theorem and the dynamical
formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1
dimensions, without any symmetry assumptions. The analysis critically hinges on
a finely calibrated hierarchy of estimates for the Weyl curvature, Ricci
coefficients, and velocity moments of the distribution function, designed to
capture the delicate interaction between the geometric and kinetic structures
of the coupled system. The presence of the Vlasov field introduces significant
analytic challenges, both in terms of integrability and regularity. These are
circumvented through a refined renormalization of the Ricci coefficients, a
strategic restriction of the need for the elliptic estimates to a minimal
number of Ricci coefficients, and a precise commutator calculus adapted to the
geometry of the mass-shell of the tangent bundle of the dynamical spacetime.
The results constitute the first large-data, symmetry-free construction of
dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter. Beyond its
immediate application to the Einstein-Vlasov system in regimes of strong
gravitational interaction and absence of symmetry, we anticipate that this
framework will prove useful in a broader context, including, for instance,
simplified approaches to the proof of nonlinear stability of Minkowski
spacetime with massless Vlasov matter

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To describe the behavior of polyatomic ideal gases where translational and internal modes have weak interactions, requiring specialized fluid dynamic equations.

Method: Proposed a Boltzmann equation with combined inelastic and elastic collisions, then applied Chapman-Enskog expansion to derive fluid dynamic equations for dominant elastic collision cases.

Result: Systematically obtained Euler and Navier-Stokes type equations featuring two temperatures (translational and internal) with relaxation terms, with variations depending on interaction strength.

Conclusion: The derived two-temperature fluid dynamic equations provide a systematic framework for modeling polyatomic gases with weak translational-internal mode interactions.

Abstract: A polyatomic ideal gas with weak interaction between the translational and
internal modes is considered. For the purpose of describing the behavior of
such a gas, a Boltzmann equation is proposed in the form that the collision
integral is a linear combination of inelastic and elastic (or resonant)
collisions, and its basic properties are discussed. Then, in the case where the
elastic collisions are dominant, fluid dynamic equations of Euler and
Navier--Stokes type including two temperatures, i.e., translational and
internal temperatures, as well as relaxation terms are systematically obtained
by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion. The obtained equations are different
depending on the degree of weakness of the interaction between the
translational and internal modes.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies positive radial solutions to double-power nonlinear stationary Schrödinger equations in 3D, showing non-uniqueness of H¹-positive solutions for small frequencies and classifying them into ground state and Aubin-Talenti type solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the non-uniqueness phenomenon of positive radial solutions in three-dimensional double-power nonlinear Schrödinger equations, particularly when the frequency is small, and to understand the structure of these solutions.

Method: Analysis of positive radial solutions using constrained variational methods, classification into ground state and Aubin-Talenti type solutions, and examination of non-degeneracy and Morse index properties.

Result: Established multiplicity of positive solutions for small frequencies, with two distinct types: ground state solutions (vanishing L∞ norm as frequency→0) and Aubin-Talenti type solutions (diverging L∞ norm as frequency→0).

Conclusion: The paper successfully classifies all positive solutions with small frequency into two categories and establishes their multiplicity, while also analyzing their non-degeneracy and Morse index properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate positive radial solutions to double-power
nonlinear stationary Schrodinger equations in three space dimensions. It is now
known that the non-uniqueness of H^{1}-positive solutions can occur in three
dimensions when the frequency is sufficiently small. Under suitable conditions,
in addition to the ground state solution (whose L^{\infty} norm vanishes as the
frequency tends to zero), there exists another positive solution that minimizes
a different constrained variational problem, with an L^{\infty} norm diverging
as the frequency tends to zero (see Theorem 1.4). We classify all positive
solutions with small frequency into two categories: the ground state and the
Aubin-Talenti type solution. As a consequence, we establish the multiplicity of
positive solutions. Finally, we also examine the non-degeneracy and Morse index
of each positive solution.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Liouville theorems for nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations with gradient-dependent reactions, using Ishii-Lions and adapted Bernstein methods to prove bounded solutions are constant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Liouville-type results to equations with nonhomogeneous operators involving gradient terms, bridging gaps between classical results for Hamilton-Jacobi and Lane-Emden equations.

Method: Two approaches: Ishii-Lions technique for reactions bounded by g(u)|∇u|^m (m>q), and adapted Bernstein method for other cases, handling unbounded coefficients in nonhomogeneous operators.

Result: Proved all bounded solutions in ℝ^N are constant for various reaction forms, extending Lions' result to (p,q)-Laplacian and providing initial contributions to Gidas-Spruck and Serrin-Zou type theorems.

Conclusion: First study of Liouville properties for nonhomogeneous operators with gradient-dependent reactions, successfully establishing constant solutions under various conditions through adapted techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of Liouville-type theorems for a class of
nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations featuring reactions that depend
on the solution and its gradient. Specifically, we investigate equations of the
form $-\Delta_p u - \Delta_q u = f(u,\nabla u)$ with $p > q > 1$, where the
nonlinearity $f$ takes forms such as $u^s|\nabla u|^m$ or $u^s + M|\nabla u|^m$
($s, m\geq 0$). Our approach is twofold. For cases where the reaction term
satisfies $|f(u,\nabla u)|\leq g(u)|\nabla u|^m$ with $m>q$ and $g$ is
continuous, we prove that every bounded solution (without sign restriction) in
$\mathbb{R}^N$ is constant by means of an Ishii-Lions type technique. In the
remaining scenarios, we turn to the Bernstein method. The application of this
method to the nonhomogeneous operator requires a nontrivial adaptation, as,
roughly speaking, constant coefficients are replaced by functions that may not
be bounded from above, which enables us to establish a crucial a priori
estimate for the gradient of solutions in any domain $\Omega$. This estimate,
in turn, implies the desired Liouville properties on the entire space
$\mathbb{R}^N$. As a consequence, we have fully extended Lions Liouville-type
result for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to the $(p,q)$-Laplacian setting, while
for the $(p,q)$ generalized Lane-Emden equation, we provide an initial
contribution in the direction of the classical result by Gidas and Spruck for
$p=q=2$, as well as that of Serrin and Zou for $p=q$.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which studies Liouville
properties for equations with nonhomogeneous operator involving source gradient
terms.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes isoperimetric inequalities for low-order eigenvalues of weighted Steklov eigenvalue problems with radial weight functions, extending classical results to weighted cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical isoperimetric inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues (from Weinstock and others) to weighted cases with prescribed positive radial weight functions, addressing problems where the domain has appropriate symmetry.

Method: Two-part approach: 1) For specific power-law weights w(x)=|x|^α and v(x)=|x|^(β-α), uses explicit spectrum computation in radial case, variational principles, and weighted isoperimetric inequalities with double density. 2) For v≡1 and w(x)=W(|x|) with W non-decreasing and log-convex, employs a new weighted isoperimetric inequality.

Result: Establishes isoperimetric inequalities for low-order eigenvalues under suitable symmetry assumptions on the domain, providing extensions of classical results to weighted Steklov eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes classical isoperimetric inequalities to weighted Steklov eigenvalue problems, introducing new weighted isoperimetric inequalities that may have independent mathematical interest beyond the specific eigenvalue problems studied.

Abstract: We study the following class of Steklov eigenvalue problems: \[ \nabla \cdot
\bigl( w \nabla u \bigr) = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, \qquad \frac{\partial
u}{\partial \nu} = \gamma v u \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega, \] where $w$
and $v$ are prescribed positive radial functions, $\Omega$ is a Lipschitz
domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N \geq 2$ and $\nu$ denotes its outward unit
normal. Extending classical results in the unweighted case due to Weinstock,
the first author, and others, we establish isoperimetric inequalities for
low-order eigenvalues under suitable symmetry assumptions on the domain. In the
first part, we consider the case $w(x) = |x|^{\alpha}$ and $v(x) =
|x|^{\beta-\alpha}$, where the parameters $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}$
satisfy appropriate constraints. Our analysis relies on an explicit computation
of the spectrum in the radial case, variational principles, and a family of
weighted isoperimetric inequalities with ``double density''. In the second
part, we address the case $v \equiv 1$ and $w(x) = W(|x|)$, where $W$ is a
non-decreasing, log-convex function. In this setting, the proof relies, among
other tools, on a new weighted isoperimetric inequality, which may be of
independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide reliable error estimates for spectral fractional operator approximations that are independent of specific computational methods or meshes, ensuring validity for any energy-admissible approximation.

Method: Uses the Stinga-Torrea extension to transform nonlocal spectral fractional problems into local problems in higher dimensions, then derives computable a posteriori error estimates.

Result: Developed fully computable a posteriori error estimates that contain no method-dependent conditions or constants, applicable to any energy admissible approximation of the extended problem.

Conclusion: The proposed a posteriori estimates provide reliable error control for spectral fractional operator approximations, with complete independence from computational methods and meshes used.

Abstract: The paper is concerned with a posteriori estimates for approximations of
boundary value problems generated by the spectral fractional operator. The
derivation is based upon the Stinga--Torrea extension that transfers the
corresponding nonlocal problem to a local problem of higher dimensionality. The
estimates are fully computable and contain no conditions and constants
depending on a method or mesh used to compute an approximation. They are valid
for any energy admissible approximation of the extended problem.

Shvydkoy [Comm. Math. Phys. 264 (2006), no. 2, 335-347], we prove nonlinear
instability of the solution around this steady state in $L^p$, for any $p>1$.
In particular, our results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first
rigorous instability results for 3D MHD without forcing, in which the
instability is produced as a result of the (exponential) growth of the magnetic
field. Furthermore, we offer a mathematical proof of the physically conjectured
transfer of energy from the velocity field to the magnetic field in the MHD
system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To calculate the exponential convergence rate of the heated string system (mixed hyperbolic-parabolic PDE system) towards equilibrium, independent of initial data.

Method: Asymptotic analysis at Fourier side of linearized problem using Kato's approach, with delicate estimates of nonlinear terms and careful spectral analysis.

Result: Obtained exponential convergence rate towards equilibrium and enhanced time decay of the solution.

Conclusion: The Kato-inspired Fourier analysis method effectively estimates convergence rates for mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems when combined with careful nonlinear term analysis.

Abstract: In the present manuscript, we calculate the exponential rate of convergence
of the heated string system (a mixed-type hyperbolic-parabolic system of PDEs)
towards the equilibrium, independently of the initial data. As a by-product of
our analysis, we obtain an enhanced time decay of the solution.
  The main tool of our reasoning consists of asymptotic analysis at the Fourier
side of the linearized problem in the spirit of Kato. The latter method fits
very well to the estimates obtained earlier for the system. The matching
between the linear problem and the nonlinear original system requires delicate
estimates of the nonlinear terms at the Fourier side as well as careful
spectral analys

TL;DR: Full-f global gyrokinetic turbulence simulations using only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs, without empirical adjustments, showing good agreement with experimental data and demonstrating predictive capability for fusion device design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop computational tools for economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without relying on experimental measurements, enabling better extrapolation to reactor scales.

Method: Full-f global gyrokinetic turbulence simulations using Gkeyll with adaptive sourcing algorithm that controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing from neutral recycling, applied to TCV discharges with different triangularity configurations.

Result: Simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with experimental data, reproduce characteristic features like blob transport and self-organized electric fields, and show that negative triangularity increases E×B flow shear by ~20%, correlating with reduced turbulent losses.

Conclusion: The demonstrated predictive capability, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models, indicates feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices, though physical models can be refined in future work.

Abstract: Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates
computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering
parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma
profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence
simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only
magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many
modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data,
raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach
directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such
empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in
Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing
due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare
reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak
\`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations
reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized
electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects
suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for
negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130
indicate that NT increases the $E \times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these
cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in
the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models
contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive
capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with
kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the
feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of core instabilities is essential to understand physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma confinement in tokamaks.

Method: Numerical analysis of ideal internal kink mode and m=1 collisionless tearing mode using both gyrokinetic and MHD codes, comparing different models and setup parameters.

Result: Gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain ideal MHD limit. Internal kink mode stability strongly depends on setup parameters like parallel magnetic field fluctuations, aspect ratio, ion treatment, and electron mass. Instabilities can be stabilized by diamagnetic effects.

Conclusion: Gyrokinetic and MHD models can be reconciled for internal kink mode through careful simulation setup, but collisionless tearing mode requires more advanced treatment beyond MHD.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of core instabilities in tokamak plasmas is essential to
understand the underlying physical mechanisms and their impact on plasma
confinement. The ideal stability of the internal kink mode and the m = 1
collisionless tearing mode are analyzed numerically both with gyrokinetic and
MHD codes. We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show
that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal
MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink
mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the
inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio,
the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by
diamagnetic effects. Our results indicate that gyrokinetic and MHD models can
be reconciled in the description of the internal kink mode by careful
consideration of the simulation setup and model assumptions, but instabilities
like the collisionless tearing mode require a more advanced treatment beyond
MHD.

*Fei Ren,Sifan Wang,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Hai-Sui Yu,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed GFF-PIELM method improves conventional PIELM by integrating Fourier feature mappings as activation functions with frequency coefficients, enabling better handling of high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs without increasing training time or complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PIELM struggles with solving PDEs involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors, requiring a more effective approach to capture diverse frequency components.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Integrate Fourier feature mapping as activation function in ELM, 2) Assign frequency coefficients to hidden neurons, 3) Develop initialization method based on ELM output weight distribution.

Result: GFF-PIELM significantly improves predictive accuracy for high-frequency, variable-frequency, multi-scale, irregular boundary, and inverse problems compared to conventional PIELM, without additional training time or complexity costs.

Conclusion: PIELM can be effectively extended to solve high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and the initialization strategy may inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

TL;DR: nuGPR is a new framework that reduces Gaussian Process Regression training costs using numerical linear algebra techniques, achieving 2x faster training and 12x lower memory usage compared to existing GPU implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and memory requirements of traditional Gaussian Process Regression training, which limits its practical application.

Method: Uses preconditioned conjugate gradient for linear solves, exploits data clustering for block-diagonal covariance structure, employs low-rank approximations of off-diagonal blocks, uses numerical gradients instead of exact differentiation, and leverages CUDA for GPU parallelization.

Result: Reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets compared to the best existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Conclusion: nuGPR provides an efficient end-to-end training algorithm that significantly improves the computational efficiency of Gaussian Process Regression while maintaining its inherent uncertainty measurement capabilities.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

TL;DR: The paper proves nonlinear stability of N-solitons in coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations and (N1,N2)-solitons in coupled modified Korteweg-de Vries equations in Sobolev spaces, with stability analysis based on Lyapunov functional and integrable properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous nonlinear stability results for multi-soliton solutions in coupled integrable systems, extending classical stability analysis to more complex soliton configurations including breathers and multi-hump solitons.

Method: Uses Lyapunov functional analysis, counting negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the functional, and exploits integrable properties of the systems. Also constructs solutions to linearized spectral problems from stationary zero curvature equations in Lie algebras.

Result: Proves N-solitons of CNLS equations are stable in H^N space with N negative eigenvalues, and (N1,N2)-solitons of CmKdV equations are stable in H^(2N1+N2) space with N1+floor((N2+1)/2) negative eigenvalues. Method also applies to classical NLS and mKdV equations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes nonlinear stability for various soliton configurations in coupled integrable systems, providing explicit eigenvalue counts and extending classical results through integrable system techniques and Lie algebraic constructions.

Abstract: We prove that the $N$-solitons, including breathers and multi-hump solitons,
of the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations are nonlinearly stable
in the Sobolev space $H^{N}$. Moreover, $(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the coupled
modified Korteweg--de Vries (CmKdV) equations are shown to be nonlinearly
stable in the Sobolev space $H^{2N_{1}+N_{2}}$. The number of negative
eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional is $N$ for
$N$-solitons of the CNLS equations, and $N_{1}+\lfloor (N_{2}+1)/2 \rfloor$ for
$(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the CmKdV equations, which is obtained by
exploiting integrable properties. The stability of solitons for the classical
NLS and mKdV equations also follows from the same method. In addition, we show
that solutions to the linearized spectral problem of the mixed flow equation
can be constructed from solutions of the stationary zero curvature equations in
a large class of Lie algebras.

TL;DR: Polar filaments can predict future sunspot cycle strength earlier than polar field measurements, establishing a new solar cycle forecasting tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polar magnetic fields are hard to observe directly but are crucial for predicting sunspot cycles. Polar filaments offer an alternative way to understand solar polar field dynamics.

Method: Analyzed long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length from Meudon Observatory data, combined with solar surface flux transport simulations to connect with Babcock-Leighton dynamo mechanism.

Result: Discovered relationship between residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles and amplitude of next sunspot cycle, enabling earlier solar cycle forecasts than polar field based methods.

Conclusion: Polar filament properties encode the physics of poloidal magnetic field interactions between cycles, serving as precursors for upcoming solar cycle strength.

Abstract: Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation
of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the
best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the
amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields
are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from
near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated
structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical
insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the
long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon
Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we
establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar
dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and
evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the
residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next
sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts --
advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We
conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction
of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the
resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current
cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangling complex many-body contributions in high-harmonic generation spectra remains challenging, and standard Fourier analysis often obscures important coupling signatures.

Method: Used a Transformer encoder with self-attention mechanism to analyze HHG signals from a 1D Kronig-Penney model, combined with Gabor time-frequency analysis to extract weak coupling channels.

Result: The approach successfully identified signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling, amplified weak coupling channels contributing to even-order harmonics, and revealed that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events.

Conclusion: Transformer-based attention provides a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, enabling interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to
probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However,
disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains
challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a
Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a
one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently
highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency
spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band
coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining
attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak
coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous
spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts
as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a
physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work
establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state
strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine
learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.

also briefly describe how the method can be adapted to treat the deformation of

Motivation: To understand the smallest constant c such that operators can be compressed from commuting normal operators of norm at most c, particularly for pairs of contractions.

Method: Numerical experiments using a simple algorithm to compute dilation constants for random unitary matrices, combined with theoretical analysis assuming the experimental convergence holds.

Result: Experiments strongly indicate the commuting dilation constant converges to √2 for random unitary matrices as N→∞ almost surely. Under this assumption, it's proven that the constant is strictly less than 2 for arbitrary contraction pairs.

is the smallest number $c$ such that the operators of $T$ are a simultaneous
compression of commuting normal operators of norm at most $c$. We present
numerical experiments giving a strong indication that the commuting dilation
constant of a pair of independent random $N{\times}N$ unitary matrices
converges to $\sqrt2$ as $N \to \infty$ almost surely. Under the assumption
that this is the case, we prove that the commuting dilation constant of an
arbitrary pair of contractions is strictly smaller than $2$. Our experiments
are based on a simple algorithm that we introduce for the purpose of computing
dilation constants between tuples of matrices.

*Luigi Ambrosio,Toni Ikonen,Danka Lučić,Enrico Pasqualetto*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: This paper studies vector calculus on metric measure spaces, focusing on different notions of vector fields, derivations, gradients, divergence measures, and Laplacian measures, with applications in potential analysis and Sobolev space duality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and unify various approaches to vector calculus in non-smooth metric measure spaces, extending classical calculus concepts to more general geometric settings.

Method: The authors analyze different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations from the literature, study their mutual relations, and investigate gradients, divergence measures, and Laplacian measures systematically.

Result: The work provides a comprehensive framework for vector calculus on metric measure spaces, obtaining results for the full range of exponents p∈[1,∞) without requiring finite measure assumptions.

Conclusion: This paper establishes foundational results for vector calculus in non-smooth metric spaces, with applications to potential analysis (condenser capacity) and Sobolev space duality theory, completing the Sobolev calculus framework initiated in the first work.

Abstract: This is the second of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric
measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several
approaches to vector calculus in the non-smooth setting of complete and
separable metric spaces equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. More
precisely, we study different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations
appearing in the literature, as well as their mutual relation. We also carry
forward a thorough investigation of gradients, divergence measures, and
Laplacian measures, together with their applications in potential analysis (for
example, regarding the condenser capacity) and in the study of duality
properties of Sobolev spaces. Most of the results are obtained for the full
range of exponents $p\in[1,\infty)$ and without finiteness assumption on the
measure.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: plasmonX is an open-source code for simulating plasmonic responses in nanostructures using both atomistic and implicit models, with post-processing capabilities for electric field analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a publicly available tool for simulating plasmonic responses in complex nanostructures, addressing the need for both atomistic and continuum descriptions.

Method: Uses frequency-dependent fluctuating charges (ωFQ) and dipoles (ωFQFμ) models for atomistic structures, and Boundary Element Method with DPCM and IEF-PCM variants for implicit representations.

Result: Successfully developed plasmonX as the first public release capable of simulating plasmonic responses across various material types including metals, graphene, and multi-metal nanostructures.

Conclusion: plasmonX provides a comprehensive open-source platform for plasmonic simulations with both atomistic and continuum approaches, enabling detailed analysis of electric field-induced properties.

Abstract: We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for
simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports
both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular,
it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles
($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic
structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and
multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element
Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM)
and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also
includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric
field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.

### [54] [Two-Sided Free Boundary Problems Arising From Branching-Selection Particle Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12701)
*Jacob Mercer*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a two-sided free boundary problem from the (N,p)-BBM model, showing convergence to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit with explicit boundary conditions and proving convergence of asymptotic velocity to the traveling wave speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the N-particle branching Brownian motion model by allowing selection on both leftmost and rightmost particles, extending previous one-sided models to broader applications in evolutionary dynamics and flame propagation.

Method: Analysis of the (N,p)-BBM model using asymptotic methods as N→∞, establishing convergence to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit described by a free boundary problem with two moving boundaries and explicit boundary conditions parametrized by p.

Result: The empirical distribution converges to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit with explicit Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the asymptotic velocity v_{N,p} converges to v_p, the unique traveling wave speed of the limiting free boundary problem.

Conclusion: The results successfully generalize one-sided models and establish connections to broader classes of free boundary problems, providing rigorous mathematical foundations for applications in evolutionary dynamics and flame propagation.

Abstract: We introduce and analyse a two-sided free boundary problem arising from a
generalization of the well-known $N$-particle branching Brownian motion
($N$-BBM) model, called the $(N, p)$-BBM, where selection can occur on both the
leftmost and rightmost particles according to a parameter $p\in(0,1)$. The main
result here establishes that, as $N\to\infty$, the empirical distribution of
the $(N,p)$-BBM converges to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit described by a
free boundary problem on a finite interval with two moving boundaries, and
explicit Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions parametrized by $p$. We
further prove that the asymptotic velocity $v_{N,p}$ of the $(N,p)$-BBM
converges, as $N\to\infty$, to $v_p$, the unique travelling wave speed of the
limiting free boundary problem. These results generalize previous one-sided
models and connect to broader classes of free boundary problems found in
evolutionary dynamics and flame propagation.
