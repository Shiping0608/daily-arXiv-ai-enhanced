A recent promising development is the use of the\n\"scale-filtered\" Vlasov-Maxwell equations to fully quantify the scale-by-scale\nenergy balance, a feature that was absent when using fluid models in kinetic\nplasmas. In particular, this method reveals that the energy transfer in kinetic\nscales is fully accounted for by the scale-filtered pressure-strain\ninteraction. Despite this progress, the influence of ion-electron thermal\ndisequilibrium on the kinetic-scale energy budget remains poorly understood.\nUsing two-dimensional fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of decaying\nplasma turbulence, we systematically investigate the pressure-strain\ninteraction and its components at sub-ion scales by varying electron-to-ion\ntemperature ratios. Our analysis focuses on three key ingredients of the\npressure-strain interaction: the normal and shear components of Pi-D and\npressure dilatation. Our results demonstrate that the scale-filtered\npressure-strain interaction is dominated by scale-filtered Pi-D across the\nkinetic range, with the shear component consistently providing the dominant\ncontribution. We find that the scale-filtered normal and shear contributions of\nPi-D exhibit persistent anticorrelation and opposite signs across all kinetic\nscales.

However,\nsolving the KS chemotaxis system and generating its aggregation patterns remain\nchallenging due to the emergence of solutions exhibiting near-singular\nbehavior, such as finite-time blow-up or concentration phenomena. Building on a\nLagrangian framework of the KS system, we develop DeepLagrangian, a\nself-adaptive density estimation method that learns and generates aggregation\npatterns and near-singular solutions of the KS system in two- and\nthree-dimensional (2D and 3D) space under different physical parameters. The\nmain advantage of the Lagrangian framework is its inherent ability to adapt to\nnear-singular solutions. To develop this framework, we normalize the KS\nsolution into a probability density function (PDF), derive the corresponding\nnormalized KS system, and utilize the property of the continuity equation to\nrewrite the system into a Lagrangian framework. We then define a\nphysics-informed Lagrangian loss to enforce this framework and incorporate a\nflow-based generative model, called the time-dependent KRnet, to approximate\nthe PDF by minimizing the loss. Furthermore, we integrate time-marching\nstrategies with the time-dependent KRnet to enhance the accuracy of the PDF\napproximation. After obtaining the approximate PDF, we recover the original KS\nsolution. We also prove that the Lagrangian loss effectively controls the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate PDF and the exact PDF.\nIn the numerical experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy of our DeepLagrangian\nmethod for the 2D and 3D KS chemotaxis system with/without advection."}

The proposed method preserves both the geometric\nconservation law (GCL) and the well-balanced property. Mesh motion effects are\ndirectly incorporated by formulating numerical fluxes that account for the\nspatial temporal nonuniformity of the flow field and the swept area of moving\ncell interfaces. This allows temporal updates to be performed on the physical\nmoving mesh, avoiding data remapping. The compact GKS provides time accurate\nevolution of flow variables and fluxes, enabling the scheme to achieve\nsecond-order temporal accuracy within a single stage. To consistently treat\nbottom topography on moving meshes, an evolution equation for the topography is\nestablished and discretized using a compatible space-time scheme, in which the\nfluxes induced by mesh motion are computed accurately.

GFS addresses key challenges such as the Gibbs phenomenon and poor\nconvergence in non-periodic settings by decomposing functions into periodic and\naperiodic com- ponents. The periodic part is represented using standard Fourier\nmodes and efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The\naperiodic component employs adaptive, low-rank sinusoidal functions with\nnon-harmonic modes, dynamically tuned to capture discontinuities and derivative\njumps across domain boundaries. Unlike conventional Fourier extension methods,\nGFS achieves high accuracy without requiring compu- tational domain extensions,\noffering a compact and efficient representation of non-periodic functions. The\nadaptive low-rank approach ensures accuracy while minimizing computational\noverhead, typically involving additional complex modes for the aperiodic part.\nFurthermore, GFS demonstrates a high-resolution power, with degrees of freedom\ncomparable to FFT in periodic domains, and maintains N log2(N) computational\ncomplexity. The effectiveness of GFS is validated through numerical\nexperiments, showcasing its ability to approximate functions and their\nderivatives in non-periodic domains accurately.

This approach\nprovides a tight upper bound for the primal value function, even in\nhigh-dimensional settings. We prove that the upper bound derived from\nDeepMartingale converges under very mild assumptions. Even more importantly, we\nestablish the expressivity of DeepMartingale: it approximates the true value\nfunction within any prescribed accuracy $\\varepsilon$ under our architectural\ndesign of neural networks whose size is bounded by\n$\\tilde{c}\\,D^{\\tilde{q}}\\varepsilon^{-\\tilde{r}}$, where the constants\n$\\tilde{c}, \\tilde{q}, \\tilde{r}$ are independent of the dimension $D$ and the\naccuracy $\\varepsilon$. This guarantees that DeepMartingale does not suffer\nfrom the curse of dimensionality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\npractical effectiveness of DeepMartingale, confirming its convergence,\nexpressivity, and stability."}

For realistic extreme events that are\ncorrelated or share similar patterns, it is reasonable to expect that the\ndominant vulnerability or failure sources behind them share the same locations\nbut with different severity. Early warning diagnosis that proactively\nidentifies the key vulnerabilities responsible for a number of system collapses\nof interest can significantly enhance resilience. This paper proposes a\nmulti-period sparse optimization method, enabling the discovery of {persistent\nfailure sources} across a sequence of collapsed systems with increasing system\nstress, such as rising demand or worsening contingencies. This work defines\npersistency and efficiently integrates persistency constraints to capture the\n``hidden'' evolving vulnerabilities. Circuit-theory based power flow\nformulations and circuit-inspired optimization heuristics are used to\nfacilitate the scalability of the method. Experiments on benchmark systems show\nthat the method reliably tracks persistent vulnerability locations under\nincreasing load stress, and solves with scalability to large systems ({on\naverage} taking {around} 200 s per scenario on 2000+ bus systems)."}

Many existing computational studies rely on\nsimplified geometries or turbulence models, limiting their simulation's ability\nto resolve flow features such shear-layer instabilities or secondary vortices.\nIn this study, direct numerical simulations were performed for inspiratory flow\nthrough a detailed airway model which covers the nasal mask region to the 6th\nbronchial bifurcation. Simulations were conducted at two physiologically\nrelevant \\textsc{Reynolds} numbers with respect to the pharyngeal diameter,\ni.e., at Re_p=400 (resting) and Re_p=1200 (elevated breathing). These values\ncharacterize resting and moderately elevated breathing conditions. A\nlattice-Boltzmann method was employed to directly simulate the flow, i.e., no\nturbulence model was used. The flow field was examined across four anatomical\nregions: 1) the nasal cavity, 2) the naso- and oropharynx, 3) the\nlaryngopharynx and larynx, and 4) the trachea and carinal bifurcation. The\ntotal pressure loss increased from 9.76 Pa at Re_p=400 to 41.93 Pa at\nRe_p=1200. The nasal cavity accounted for the majority of this loss for both\nReynolds numbers, though its relative contribution decreased from 81.3% at\nRe_p=400 to 73.4% at Re_p=1200. At Re_p=1200, secondary vortices in the\nnasopharyngeal bend and turbulent shear-layers in the glottis jet enhanced the\nlocal pressure losses. In contrast, the carinal bifurcation mitigated upstream\nunsteadiness and stabilized the flow. A key outcome is the spatial correlation\nbetween the pressure loss and the onset of flow instabilities across the four\nregions. This yields a novel perspective on how the flow resistance and vortex\ndynamics vary with geometric changes and flow rate."}

On the other hand, the weights of that average\nare multilinear functions of the observed responses. That representation allows\nto characterise the set of possible shrinkages and identify extreme situations\nwhere the PLS estimator has an highly nonlinear behaviour.
