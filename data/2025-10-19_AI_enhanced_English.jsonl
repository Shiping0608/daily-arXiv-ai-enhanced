In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and\nQuantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates\nfor quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in\ndeveloping QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely\nfocused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the\nzoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to\nsupport many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely\nlimited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation\nis crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such\nmeasurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we\npropose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which\ncircumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for\nsimulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe\nhow the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an\nasymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed\ncomplexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider\nthe benefits and costs of several encodings.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes quantum computing methods for CFD that avoid flow field measurement by using discrete optimization and quantum search, providing potential quantum advantage through amplitude estimation.", "motivation": "Current quantum CFD methods (QLGA/QLBM) focus on model development rather than practical applications, and their reliance on quantum state tomography often cancels out potential quantum advantages.", "method": "Simulates multiple lattice configurations simultaneously using amplitude estimation and quantum search algorithms, with detailed gate-level complexity analysis of circuit implementations.", "result": "Developed methods that circumvent flow field measurement entirely and provide asymptotic quantum advantage through quantum search optimization.", "conclusion": "The proposed approach enables practical quantum CFD applications by avoiding measurement bottlenecks and achieving quantum advantage through optimization-based methods rather than traditional flow field reconstruction."}}
