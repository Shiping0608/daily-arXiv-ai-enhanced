One remarkable property of ESFR schemes is their ability to be expressed\nequivalently as linearly filtered discontinuous Galerkin (FDG) schemes. In this\nstudy, we introduce Sobolev Stable discontinuous Galerkin (SSDG) schemes, a new\nconservative and linearly stable generalization of ESFR schemes via the FDG\nframework. Additionally, we review existing generalizations of the ESFR method\nand consider their relationship with the FDG framework. The linear properties\nof SSDG schemes are studied via Von Neumann analysis and compared to those of\nthe existing extended ESFR (EESFR) method. It is found that while SSDG and\nEESFR schemes exhibit fundamentally different dispersive and dissipative\nbehaviors, they can achieve a similar increase in CFL limit and exhibit a\nsimilar spectral order of accuracy.

While\ndeterministic models (partial differential equations) of such processes are\nwell established, their inability to capture inherent randomness, and the\nassumption of a large number of particles, hinders their applicability. To\naddress these issues, we present several equivalent (discrete-space\ndiscrete-time) random walk models of diffusion described by a\nspatially-invariant tensor on a two-dimensional domain with no-flux boundary\nconditions. Our approach involves discretising the deterministic model in space\nand time to give a homogeneous Markov chain governing particle movement between\n(spatial) lattice sites over time. The spatial discretisation is carried out\nusing a vertex-centred element-based finite volume method on rectangular and\nhexagonal lattices, and a forward Euler discretisation in time yields a\nnearest-neighbour random walk model with simple analytical expressions for the\ntransition probabilities. For each lattice configuration, analysis of these\nexpressions yields constraints on the time step duration, spatial steps and\ndiffusion tensor to ensure the probabilities are between zero and one. We find\nthat model implementation on a rectangular lattice can be achieved with a\nconstraint on the diffusion tensor, whereas a hexagonal lattice overcomes this\nlimitation (no restrictions on the diffusion tensor).
