Classical formulas by Fagnano, Euler, and Ramanujan, as\nwell as modern refinements such as Cantrell and Koshy methods, aim to reduce\nthe approximation error while maintaining computational simplicity. In this\npaper, we introduce a new closed-form expression that enhances Ramanujan second\nformula by dividing it by 1 minus a binomial of two exponential terms resulting\nin a very stable approximation in a range of b/a between 1 and 1/10000, or even\nup to a smaller ratio. The resulting approximation remains compact, requiring\nonly four constants, and achieving a remarkable tradeoff between simplicity and\naccuracy. Across the full eccentricity range of b/a in [0.0001,1], our method\nattains a maximum relative error of approximately 0.57 ppm with respect to the\nexact perimeter computed via elliptic integral. Our formula is quasi-exact at\nthe extremes, for the circle b/a=1 and for the degenerate flat ellipse b/a=0.\nCompared with Cantrell approximation, the proposed method reduces the maximum\nrelative error by a factor of 25 while preserving a short and elegant\nexpression. This makes it one of the simplest yet most accurate closed-form and\nsingle-line approximations to the ellipse perimeter currently available in the\nliterature."}

The model adopts an Eulerian representation of\nthe two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the\ninterface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase\npyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture\nthe coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle\nshrinkage. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in\nthis multidimensional framework. The resulting model demonstrates mass\nconservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental\ndata shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and\ncorrect volatiles trends. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, but they\nalso highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution\nof the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the\ndevelopment of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups,\ndeveloped within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly\navailable."}

The parallelization consists of two\nlevels: (1) on the highest level, the application of the rational filter to the\nvarious vectors is partitioned among groups of processors; (2) within each\ngroup, every linear system is solved in parallel.\n  In ParaSLRF, the linear systems are solved by iterative methods instead of\ndirect ones, in contrast to other rational filter methods, such as, PFEAST.\nBecause of the specific selection of poles in ParaSLRF, the computational cost\nof solving the associated linear systems for each pole, is almost the same.\nThis intrinsically leads to a better load balance between each group of\nresources, and reduces waiting times of processes.\n  We show numerical experiments from finite element models of mechanical\nvibrations, and show a detailed parallel performance analysis.

First, we establish a local well-posedness theory for the\nopen loop model in $L^2$-based fractional Sobolev spaces in the case of\nDirichlet-Neumann type inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions. This local\nwell-posedness result is based on linear estimates derived by using the weak\nsolution formula obtained via the unified transform (also known as the Fokas\nmethod). Next, we study the global well-posedness properties of the open loop\nmodel in presence of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Then, we turn our\nattention to the rapid boundary feedback stabilization problem and design a\nnonlocal controller which uses a finite number of Fourier modes of the state of\nsolution. This design relies on the fact that solutions of the CGL equation can\nbe separated into a slow, finite-dimensional component and a rapidly decaying\ntail, with the former primarily governing long-term behavior. We determine the\nnecessary number of modes required to stabilize the system at a specified rate.\nAdditionally, we identify the minimum number of modes that ensure stabilization\nat an unspecified decay rate. These theoretical results are validated by\nnumerical simulations. The spatiotemporal estimates established in the first\npart of the paper are also employed to obtain local solutions of the controlled\nsystem. The existence of global energy solutions follows from stabilization\nestimates, while uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of an associated\ninitial-boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary conditions whose\nsolutions are in correspondence with the solutions of the original system\nthrough a bounded invertible Volterra-type integral transform on Sobolev\nspaces."}

The interface model is constructed using a\ndata-driven approach that involves sparse identification of nonlinear dy-\nnamics with control to evaluate the residual force.
