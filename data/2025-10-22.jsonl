Manuscript in preparation", "summary": "In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability,\nand electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of\n$\\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential\ncontribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and\nthermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that\n$\\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with\nspace group $Fm\\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high\nthermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for\npractical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that\n$\\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of\n$3.488~\\mathrm{eV}$ at the $\\Gamma$-point. The calculated density of states\n(DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$\norbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and\nabsorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making\n$\\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications\nsuch as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE)\ntandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$\nis $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for\nthermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future\nexperimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material."}

In realistic\nenvironments, however, irregular motions arise naturally due to environmental\ndisturbances, fluid-structure interactions, and control inputs, but their\nhydrodynamic consequences remain largely unexplored. One system where response\nto irregular forcing is particularly relevant is wave-assisted propulsion (WAP)\nsystems where free-to-pitch submerged foils generate thrust due to wave-induced\nheaving. We employ time-accurate flow simulations of elliptic WAP foils\nsubjected to irregular waves at three different sea-states to gain insights\ninto this system. Our results demonstrate that irregular heaving and pitching\ncan generate greater mean thrust than energetically equivalent sinusoidal\nheaving. Moreover, a spring-based pitch-limiting mechanism yields higher thrust\nthan an angle-limiter under the same conditions. By leveraging a previously\ndeveloped leading-edge vortex (LEV) model, we uncover the mechanisms driving\nthis thrust enhancement and highlight the critical interactions between\nunsteady flow structures and foil dynamics. These findings provide new insights\ninto flapping-foil propulsion in irregular environments and have direct\nimplications for the design and optimization of WAP systems."}

The approach employs a PDE-independent algorithm\nthat adaptively determines the hyperviscosity constant based on the spectral\nradius of the RBF-FD evolution matrix. The proposed procedure supports general\nnode layouts and is not tailored for specific equations, avoiding the\nlimitations of empirical tuning and von Neumann-based estimates. To reduce\ncomputational cost, it is shown that lower monomial augmentation in the\napproximation of the hyperviscosity operator can still ensure consistent\nstabilisation, enabling the use of smaller stencils and improving overall\nefficiency. A hybrid strategy employing different spline orders for the\nadvection and hyperviscosity operators is also implemented to enhance\nstability. The method is evaluated on pure linear advection and non-linear\nBurgers' equation, demonstrating stable performance with limited numerical\ndissipation. The two main contributions are: (1) a general hyperviscosity\nRBF-FD solution procedure demonstrated on both linear and non-linear\nadvection-dominated problems, and (2) an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of\nhyperviscosity within the RBF-FD framework, addressing the interplay between\nkey free parameters and their influence on numerical results."}
