The\nproblem is notoriously complex because discrete dividends create abrupt price\ndrops and affect the optimal exercise timing, making traditional\ncontinuous-dividend models unsuitable. Our approach utilizes the Generalized\nIntegral Transform (GIT) method introduced by the author and his co-authors in\na number of papers, which transforms the pricing problem from a complex partial\ndifferential equation with a free boundary into an integral Volterra equation\nof the second or first kind. In this paper we illustrate this approach by\nconsidering a popular GBM model that accounts for discrete cash and\nproportional dividends using Dirac delta functions. By reframing the problem as\nan integral equation, we can sequentially solve for the option price and the\nearly exercise boundary, effectively handling the discontinuities caused by the\ndividends. Our methodology provides a powerful alternative to standard\nnumerical techniques like binomial trees or finite difference methods, which\ncan struggle with the jump conditions of discrete dividends by losing accuracy\nor performance. Several examples demonstrate that the GIT method is highly\naccurate and computationally efficient, bypassing the need for extensive\ncomputational grids or complex backward induction steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "A semi-analytical method using Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) for pricing American options with discrete/continuous dividends, transforming the PDE problem into integral equations to handle dividend-induced discontinuities efficiently.", "motivation": "Traditional continuous-dividend models fail for American options with discrete dividends due to abrupt price drops and complex exercise timing, requiring better methods than standard numerical techniques.", "method": "Uses Generalized Integral Transform (GIT) to convert the free-boundary PDE problem into Volterra integral equations, handling discrete dividends via Dirac delta functions in a GBM model.", "result": "The GIT method proves highly accurate and computationally efficient, outperforming binomial trees and finite difference methods that struggle with dividend jump conditions.", "conclusion": "GIT provides a powerful alternative to standard numerical methods, effectively handling discrete dividend discontinuities while maintaining accuracy and computational efficiency."}}
