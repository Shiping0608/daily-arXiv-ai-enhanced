The 0D model, which consists of an RLC\ncircuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D\nmodel consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left\nventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this\nrepresentation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to\nventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation\ncompared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D\nmodel, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify\nthe parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration\nprocess. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic,\npulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To\nmaintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy\nis developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to\nenhance the 3D-0D model.

This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational\nsymmetry alongside spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton\npattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We\nfurther study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk\ncan induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking\ntime-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of\ntwo spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the\nconfined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined\ndespite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged\nannihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation."}

Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and\nprovided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However,\nthe observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has\nrevealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major\nfrontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy\nprojectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant\ncomputational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and\ndevelop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the\ncensus of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical\nmodeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular\nattention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of\nmolecular systems and physical environments."}
