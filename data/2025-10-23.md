### [1] [Cardiocirculatory Computational Models for the Study of Hypertension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19302)
*Simone Celora,Andrea Tonini,Francesco Regazzoni,Luca Dede',Gianfranco Parati,Alfio Quarteroni*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Development of patient-specific cardiocirculatory models (0D and 3D-0D) for hypertension Digital Twins, with sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration across three hypertension scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build Digital Twins for hypertension that provide more detailed and clinically meaningful insights than traditional 0D models alone, enabling real-time hypertension control.

Method: Used 0D cardiocirculatory models (RLC circuits with/without capillaries) and 3D-0D electromechanical models coupling 3D left ventricle mechanics with 0D circulation. Performed sensitivity analysis and parameter calibration across systemic, pulmonary, and renovascular hypertension scenarios at varying severity levels.

Result: The 3D-0D model accurately represents cardiocirculatory dynamics in hypertension and provides refined insights beyond 0D models, including ventricular deformation and stress assessment.

Conclusion: The 3D-0D model represents a significant advancement toward digital twins for real-time hypertension control, offering enhanced clinical insights compared to purely 0D approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we develop patient-specific cardiocirculatory models with the
aim of building Digital Twins for hypertension. In particular, in our
pathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models
and a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC
circuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D
model consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left
ventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this
representation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to
ventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation
compared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D
model, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify
the parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration
process. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic,
pulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To
maintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy
is developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to
enhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an
accurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of
hypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for
real-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful
insights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone.

### [2] [Energy dissipation and global convergence of a discrete normalized gradient flow for computing ground states of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19392)
*Zixu Feng,Lunxu Liu,Qinglin Tang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proves energy dissipation for the gradient flow with semi-implicit discretization (GFSI) algorithm in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Josephson junction and rotating terms, establishing global convergence to stationary states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical experiments showed energy dissipation when computing ground states of multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates using GFSI, but rigorous mathematical proof was lacking, particularly for important models with Josephson junction and rotating terms.

Method: Introduced a Lagrange multiplier to reformulate GFSI into an equivalent form, enabling mathematical proof of energy dissipation for two-component systems with Josephson junction and rotating terms.

Result: Successfully proved energy dissipation for GFSI in the two-component scenario and established global convergence to stationary states. Numerical experiments confirmed the mathematical proof and showed the time step upper bound for energy dissipation depends on particle interaction strength.

Conclusion: The study provides rigorous mathematical foundation for GFSI's energy dissipation property in important multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensate models, with numerical verification supporting the theoretical results.

Abstract: The gradient flow with semi-implicit discretization (GFSI) is the most widely
used algorithm for computing the ground state of Gross-Pitaevskii energy
functional. Numerous numerical experiments have shown that the energy
dissipation holds when calculating the ground states of multicomponent
Bose-Einstein condensates (MBECs) with GFSI, while rigorous proof remains an
open challenge. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, we reformulate the GFSI
into an equivalent form and thereby prove the energy dissipation for GFSI in
two-component scenario with Josephson junction and rotating term, which is one
of the most important and topical model in MBECs. Based on this, we further
establish the global convergence to stationary states. Also, the numerical
results of energy dissipation in practical experiments corroborate our rigorous
mathematical proof, and we numerically verified the upper bound of time step
that guarantees energy dissipation is indeed related to the strength of
particle interactions.

### [3] [Interpolatory Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation: Theoretical Foundations and Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19518)
*Benjamin Carrel,Daniel Kressner,Hei Yin Lam,Bart Vandereycken*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DLRA-DEIM combines dynamical low-rank approximation with discrete empirical interpolation method to reduce computational cost in solving large-scale matrix differential equations with nonlinearities, using oblique projections instead of orthogonal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost challenge in DLRA when dealing with nonlinear velocity fields, where orthogonal projections don't reduce computational cost despite storage reduction.

Method: Replace orthogonal tangent space projections with oblique, data-sparse projections using DEIM, creating DLRA-DEIM differential inclusion and PRK-DEIM projected integrators combining explicit Runge-Kutta methods with DEIM-based projections.

Result: DLRA-DEIM maintains the same existence, exactness and error properties as standard DLRA while being significantly cheaper. PRK-DEIM achieves the same convergence order as previous projected Runge-Kutta methods with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed DLRA-DEIM framework provides an efficient alternative to standard DLRA for nonlinear problems, with extensions to exponential Runge-Kutta methods and low-order tensor differential equations demonstrating its versatility.

Abstract: Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) is a widely used paradigm for solving
large-scale matrix differential equations, as they arise, for example, from the
discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations on tensorized
domains. Through orthogonally projecting the dynamics onto the tangent space of
a low-dimensional manifold, DLRA achieves a significant reduction of the
storage required to represent the solution. However, the need for evaluating
the velocity field can make it challenging to attain a corresponding reduction
of computational cost in the presence of nonlinearities. In this work, we
address this challenge by replacing orthogonal tangent space projections with
oblique, data-sparse projections selected by a discrete empirical interpolation
method (DEIM). At the continuous-time level, this leads to DLRA-DEIM, a
well-posed differential inclusion (in the Filippov sense) that captures the
discontinuities induced by changes in the indices selected by DEIM. We
establish an existence result, exactness property and error bound for DLRA-DEIM
that match existing results for DLRA. For the particular case of QDEIM, a
popular variant of DEIM, we provide an explicit convex-polytope
characterization of the differential inclusion. Building on DLRA-DEIM, we
propose a new class of projected integrators, called PRK-DEIM, that combines
explicit Runge--Kutta methods with DEIM-based projections. We analyze the
convergence order of PRK-DEIM and show that it matches the accuracy of
previously proposed projected Runge-Kutta methods, while being significantly
cheaper. Extensions to exponential Runge--Kutta methods and low-order tensor
differential equations demonstrate the versatility of our framework.

### [4] [Non-intrusive structural-preserving sequential data assimilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19701)
*Lizuo Liu,Tongtong Li,Anne Gelb*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A new structure-preserving sequential data assimilation framework that combines entropy-stable neural networks with structurally informed ensemble Kalman filtering for improved state estimation in unknown dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical DA methods assume known governing equations, which is unrealistic for real applications. ML can learn surrogate models but struggles with noise and data scarcity. Recent advances show physical structure improves both learning stability and DA performance.

Method: Proposes NSSDA framework using ESCFN for structure-preserving forecasting and SETKF for structurally informed assimilation. Uses only a single noisy trajectory for both training and assimilation.

Result: Numerical experiments with shallow water and Euler equations demonstrate significantly improved predictive accuracy compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages physical structure at both forecast and analysis stages, enabling accurate state estimation in highly constrained environments with unknown dynamics.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) methods combine model predictions with observational
data to improve state estimation in dynamical systems, inspiring their
increasingly prominent role in geophysical and climate applications. Classical
DA methods assume that the governing equations modeling the dynamics are known,
which is unlikely for most real world applications. Machine learning (ML)
provides a flexible alternative by learning surrogate models directly from
data, but standard ML methods struggle in noisy and data-scarce environments,
where meaningful extrapolation requires incorporating physical constraints.
Recent advances in structure-preserving ML architectures, such as the
development of the entropy-stable conservative flux form network (ESCFN),
highlight the critical role of physical structure in improving learning
stability and accuracy for unknown systems of conservation laws. Structural
information has also been shown to improve DA performance. Gradient-based
measures of spatial variability, in particular, can help refine ensemble
updates in discontinuous systems. Motivated by both of these recent
innovations, this investigation proposes a new non-intrusive,
structure-preserving sequential data assimilation (NSSDA) framework that
leverages structure at both the forecast and analysis stages. We use the ESCFN
to construct a surrogate model to preserve physical laws during forecasting,
and a structurally informed ensemble transform Kalman filter (SETKF) to embed
local statistical structure into the assimilation step. Our method operates in
a highly constrained environment, using only a single noisy trajectory for both
training and assimilation. Numerical experiments where the unknown dynamics
correspond respectively to the shallow water and Euler equations demonstrate
significantly improved predictive accuracy.

### [5] [Dictionary learning methods for brain activity mapping with MEG data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19702)
*Daniela Calvetti,Erkki Somersalo*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A Bayesian dictionary learning algorithm is proposed for identifying active brain regions from MEG data, using the Destrieux atlas for ROI partitioning and demonstrating performance through simulations with probabilistic evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve brain region identification using MEG data, which offers better time resolution and direct measurement of brain activation compared to fMRI's hemodynamic response.

Method: A two-phase Bayesian dictionary learning algorithm: first phase includes dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, second phase performs dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary using Bayesian sparsity promoting computations.

Result: The method was tested through simulations where random patches in each ROI were activated, and the algorithm successfully identified active brain regions using the probabilistic confusion matrix and multi-class classifier impurity measures.

Conclusion: The Bayesian dictionary learning algorithm provides an effective approach for brain region identification from MEG data, leveraging the Destrieux atlas for natural ROI partitioning and demonstrating robust performance through comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Abstract: A central goal in many brain studies is the identification of those brain
regions that are activated during an observation window that may correspond to
a motor task, a stimulus, or simply a resting state. While functional MRI is
currently the most commonly employed modality for such task, methods based on
the electromagnetic activity of the brain are valuable alternatives because of
their excellent time resolution and of the fact that the measured signals are
directly related to brain activation and not to a secondary effect such as the
hemodynamic response. In this work we focus on the MEG modality, investigating
the performance of a recently proposed Bayesian dictionary learning (BDL)
algorithm for brain region identification. The partitioning of the source space
into the 148 regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to parcellation of the
Destrieux atlas provides a natural determination of the subdictionaries
necessary for the BDL algorithm. We design a simulation protocol where a small
randomly selected patch in each ROI is activated, the MEG signal is computed
and the inverse problem of active brain region identification is solved using
the BDL algorithm. The BDL algorithm consists of two phases, the first one
comprising dictionary compression and Bayesian compression error analysis, and
the second one performing dictionary coding with a deflated dictionary built on
the output of the first phase, both steps relying on Bayesian sparsity
promoting computations. For assessing the performance, we give a probabilistic
interpretation of the confusion matrix, and consider different impurity
measures for a multi-class classifier.

### [6] [An active-flux-type scheme for ideal MHD with provable positivity and discrete divergence-free property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19721)
*Mengqing Liu,Dongwen Pang,Remi Abgrall,Kailiang Wu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A positivity-preserving PAMPA scheme for ideal MHD that maintains discrete divergence-free magnetic field on Cartesian grids, combining nonconservative reformulation with local DDF projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust high-order method for ideal MHD that preserves positivity of physical quantities (density, pressure) while maintaining divergence-free magnetic field throughout simulations.

Method: Extends 1D IDP PAMPA framework to multidimensional MHD using: nonconservative reformulation for PP interface updates, local DDF projection, PP limiter only at cell center, PP flux with wave-speed bounds, and Godunov-Powell source term discretization. Uses geometric quasi-linearization for pressure constraint.

Result: Method achieves high-order accuracy, sharp MHD-structure resolution, and strong-shock robustness. Successfully handles extreme cases including blast wave with plasma β ≈ 2.51×10⁻⁶ and jets up to Mach 10⁴.

Conclusion: This is the first active-flux-type ideal-MHD method that is rigorously positivity-preserving for both cell averages and interface point values while maintaining discrete divergence-free magnetic field throughout simulations.

Abstract: We develop a positivity-preserving (PP) PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment
PolynomiAl-interpreted) scheme that enforces a discrete divergence-free (DDF)
magnetic field for ideal MHD on Cartesian grids. Extending our 1D
invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) PAMPA framework (Abgrall, Jiao, Liu, Wu, SIAM
J. Sci. Comput., to appear) to multidimensional, multiwave MHD, the method
combines a limiter-free PP update of interface point values via a new
nonconservative reformulation with a local DDF projection. Cell averages are
provably PP under a mild a~priori positivity condition on one cell-centered
state, using: (i) DDF-constrained interface values, (ii) a PP limiter only at
the cell center, (iii) a PP flux with appropriate wave-speed bounds, and (iv) a
suitable discretization of the Godunov--Powell source term. The PP proof
employs geometric quasi-linearization (GQL; Wu & Shu, SIAM Review, 2023), which
linearizes the pressure constraint. The scheme avoids explicit polynomial
reconstructions, is compatible with arbitrarily high-order
strong-stability-preserving (SSP) time integration, and is simple to implement.
Robustness and resolution are enhanced by a problem-independent Lax-type
entropy troubled-cell indicator using only two characteristic speeds and a
convex oscillation elimination (COE) mechanism with a new intercell-difference
norm. Tests -- including a blast wave with plasma $\beta \approx 2.51\times
10^{-6}$ and jets up to Mach $10^{4}$ -- show high-order accuracy, sharp
MHD-structure resolution, and strong-shock robustness. To our knowledge, this
is the first active-flux-type ideal-MHD method rigorously PP for both cell
averages and interface point values while maintaining DDF throughout.

### [7] [Local boundedness of weak solutions to elliptic equations under unbalanced Orlicz growth conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18979)
*Gabriele Giannone*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Establishes conditions for local boundedness of weak solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations with unbalanced growth, using Orlicz-type setting without symmetry assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical results on elliptic equations with p,q-growth to a broader class of nonlinear equations under unbalanced growth conditions without structural assumptions.

Method: Non-variational analysis in Orlicz-type setting with distinct Young functions prescribing ellipticity and growth, covering equations with unbalanced growth.

Result: Sufficient conditions for local boundedness of weak solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form under unbalanced growth conditions.

Conclusion: The theory generalizes classical p,q-growth results and captures a wide class of nonstandard behaviors in nonlinear elliptic equations.

Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for the local boundedness of weak
solutions to a broad class of nonlinear elliptic equations in divergence form,
under unbalanced growth conditions on the stress field. Our analysis is carried
out in a non-variational setting, with no symmetry or structural assumptions on
the operator. The ellipticity and growth are prescribed via distinct Young
functions, leading to a Orlicz-type setting that captures a wide class of
nonstandard behaviors. As a special case, the theory encompasses and extends
the classical results on equations with $p,q$-growth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of discretely self-similar solutions in electron magnetohydrodynamics systems without resistivity

Method: Analysis of discretely self-similar solutions under different decay and non-decay conditions

Conclusion: Electron MHD without resistivity does not support non-trivial discretely self-similar blowup solutions under the studied conditions

Abstract: We study discretely self-similar solutions for the electron

self-similar blowup solutions.

### [9] [High Contrast Transmission and Fabry-Pérot-type Resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19096)
*Long Li,Mourad Sini*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows that highly contrasting acoustic transmissions create an infinite family of subwavelength resonances beyond just the Minnaert resonance, which are shifts of Neumann eigenvalues and exhibit Fabry-Pérot-type behavior with potential interference effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of acoustic resonances beyond the well-known Minnaert resonance and explore the full spectrum of resonances created by highly contrasting transmissions in acoustic models.

Method: Mathematical analysis using asymptotic expansions, resolvent estimates, and time-domain analysis to characterize the infinite family of resonances as shifts of Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian.

Result: 1. Derived second-order asymptotic expansions of resonances in terms of contrasting coefficient
2. Obtained resolvent estimates and uniform asymptotics of scattered fields
3. Characterized time behavior at large time-scales
4. Showed pronounced anisotropy near Fabry-Pérot resonances

Conclusion: The discovered family of infinite resonances and their anisotropic properties could enable designing anisotropic metamaterials from simple single microresonator configurations.

Abstract: It is well known, in the acoustic model, that highly contrasting transmission
leads to the so-called Minnaert subwavelength resonance. In this work, we show
that such highly contrasting transmissions create not only one resonance but a
family of infinite resonances located near the real axis where the first one
(i.e. the smallest) is indeed the Minnaert one. This family of resonances are
the shifts (in the lower complex plan) of the Neumann eigenvalues of the
Laplacian. The well known Minneart resonance is nothing but the shift of the
trivial (zero) Neumann eigenvalue of the bubble. These resonances, other than
the Minnaert ones, are Fabry-P\'erot-type resonances as the generated total
fields, in the bubble, are dominated by a linear combination of the Neumann
eigenfunctions which, in particular, might create interferences. In addition,
we establish the following properties.
  1. We derive the asymptotic expansions, at the second order, of this family
of resonances in terms of the contrasting coefficient.
  2. In the time-harmonic regime, we derive the resolvent estimates of the
related Hamiltonian and the asymptotics of scattered fields that are uniform in
the whole space, highlighting the contributions from this sequence of
resonances.
  3. In the time domain regime, we derive the time behavior of the acoustic
microresonator at large time-scales inversely proportional to powers of
microresonator's radius.
  4. The analysis shows that near Fabry-P\'erot resonances, the mircoresonator
exhibits pronounced anisotropy. We believe that such a feature may pave the way
for designing anisotropic metamaterials from simple configurations of a single
microresonator.

### [10] [Stability and slow dynamics of an interior spiky pattern in a one-dimensional spatial Solow model with capital-induced labor migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19204)
*Fanze Kong,Jiayi Sun,Shuangquan Xie*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes economic agglomeration in spatial Solow-Swan models with capital-induced labor migration, showing how interior spikes (economic concentrations) form, become unstable through Hopf bifurcation causing economic fluctuations, and slowly drift (core-periphery shifts).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental mechanisms driving spatial economic patterns like urbanization, labor migration, and resource allocation through the emergence and dynamics of economic agglomeration.

Method: Used a hybrid asymptotic and numerical method to analyze the one-dimensional spatial Solow-Swan model with capital-induced labor migration, focusing on small capital diffusivity regimes. Constructed interior spike quasi-equilibria and performed linear stability analysis.

Result: Single interior spikes remain stable for small reaction-time constants but undergo Hopf bifurcation when constants are large, leading to oscillations in spike height (economic fluctuations). Derived a differential-algebraic system capturing slow drift motion of quasi-equilibrium (core-periphery shifts).

Conclusion: The study reveals complex dynamics in economic agglomeration including stability, oscillatory behavior through bifurcation, and slow spatial shifts, providing insights into spatial economic patterns and fluctuations.

Abstract: One of the most significant findings in the study of spatial Solow-Swan
models is the emergence of economic agglomeration, in which economic activities
concentrate in specific regions. Such agglomeration provides a fundamental
mechanism driving the spatial patterns of urbanization, labor migration,
productivity growth, and resource allocation. In this paper, we consider the
one-dimensional spatial Solow-Swan model with capital-induced labor migration,
which captures the dynamic interaction between labor and capital through
migration and accumulation. Focusing on the regime of sufficiently small
capital diffusivity, we first construct an interior spike (spiky economic
agglomeration) quasi-equilibrium. Next, we perform the linear stability of the
corresponding spike equilibrium by using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical
method. We show that a single interior spike remains stable for small
reaction-time constants but undergoes a Hopf bifurcation when the constant is
sufficiently large, leading to oscillations in spike height (economic
fluctuation). Finally, we derive a differential-algebraic system to capture the
slow drift motion of quasi-equilibrium (core-periphery shift). Numerical
simulations are carried out to support our theoretical studies and reveal some
intriguing yet unexplained dynamics.

### [11] [Homogenisation of singular SPDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19339)
*Martin Hairer,Harprit Singh*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper develops a homogenisation approach for singular SPDEs by combining classical homogenisation theory with regularity structures, treating correctors as abstract noises. The method is applied to oscillatory generalisations of 2d g-PAM and Φ⁴₃ equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study homogenisation of singular SPDEs with oscillatory coefficients and understand how solutions converge to homogenised equations when both regularization and oscillation scales vanish.

Method: The approach imports classical homogenisation results into regularity structures framework and rewrites SPDEs using models where homogenisation correctors are treated as abstract noises.

Result: Established periodic space-time homogenisation for oscillatory generalisations of 2d g-PAM and Φ⁴₃ equations, showing convergence to homogenised equations along any sequence (ε,δ)→0 after appropriate renormalization.

Conclusion: The method successfully handles unbounded divergences by separating them into small-scale and large-scale terms, requiring additional bounded renormalization constants due to mesoscopic oscillations and resonances between coefficient fields and nonlinearities.

Abstract: We introduce an approach to study homogenisation of a large class of singular
SPDEs of the form $$ \partial_t u_\varepsilon - \nabla\cdot
{A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2) \nabla u_\varepsilon = F(x/\varepsilon ,
t/\varepsilon^2, u_\varepsilon , \nabla u_\varepsilon , \xi ) $$ which is based
on the idea of importing (classical) homogenisation results into the framework
of regularity structures and the insight that one can rewrite the SPDE under
consideration in terms of a model, where the correctors (from homogenisation
theory) are seen as further `abstract noises'.
  As applications, we establish periodic space-time homogenisation results for
oscillatory generalisations of the 2d g-PAM and $\Phi^4_3$ equation proving
that when the noise is regularised at scale $\delta\ll 1$ solutions to the
equation with coefficient field ${A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2)$, when
appropriately renormalised, converge to solutions to the corresponding
homogenised equation along any sequence $(\varepsilon,\delta)\to 0$. We make
the observation that the unbounded divergences can be written as sums of two
types of terms: `small scale' terms, the spatial dependence of which is an
explicit local function of the coefficient field and `large scale' terms, which
for logarithmic divergences are explicit involving the homogenised matrix and
correctors. Furthermore, in order to recover the same solution to the
corresponding homogenised equation along any joint limit $(\varepsilon,
\delta)\to 0$ one has to subtract additional bounded renormalisation constants
which appear due to oscillations at mesoscopic scales, as well as due to
resonances between the coefficient field and the oscillations in the
nonlinearity.

*Anvarbek Meirmanov*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper develops a homogenization approach to derive Biot's model for joint motion of two immiscible viscous liquids in elastic porous media, moving from microscopic to macroscopic description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mathematically model the complex physical process of two immiscible viscous liquids moving through the pore space of a solid skeleton, bridging microscopic pore-level dynamics to macroscopic continuum descriptions.

Method: First analyzes the process at microscopic level using Lame equations for solid skeleton and Stokes equations for liquids. Then uses homogenization procedure on approximate model B^ε to derive macroscopic Biot's model.

Result: Successfully derived Biot's model that describes the joint motion of two weakly viscous immiscible fluids in an elastic solid skeleton at macroscopic level through homogenization.

Conclusion: The homogenization procedure provides an effective mathematical framework to transition from microscopic pore-scale models to macroscopic continuum descriptions for complex fluid-solid interaction problems in porous media.

Abstract: We consider initial boundary value problems arising in mathematical models
for joint motion of two immiscible viscous liquids in a pore space of the solid
skeleton. First, we consider this physical process at the microscopic level
(the pore size $\varepsilon$ is approximately 5-20 microns) governed by the
model $\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, consisting of Lame equations for the solid
skeleton and the Stokes equations for the liquid components.
  Next, assuming the existence of a weak solution to the corresponding initial
boundary value problem at the microscopic level for the model the
$\textbf{B}^{\varepsilon}$, that approximate the model
$\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, and using the homogenization procedure we derive
the Biot's model describing the physical process in consideration at the
macroscopic level for two weakly viscous immiscible fluids in the elastic solid
skeleton at the macroscopic level.

*Perla Kfoury,Stefan Le Coz,Tai-Peng Tsai*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study of quasi-periodic standing waves in 1D cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations, establishing correspondence between ODE invariants and conserved quantities in defocusing case, with a novel numerical scheme for energy minimization under mass and momentum constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between invariants of wave profile ODEs and conserved quantities in nonlinear Schrödinger equations, and develop efficient numerical methods for computing energy minimizers under multiple constraints.

Method: Established diffeomorphic correspondence between ODE invariants and conserved quantities for defocusing case. Developed numerical scheme using gradient flow with discrete renormalization that simultaneously handles mass and momentum constraints.

Result: Found that solutions of profile ODEs correspond to energy minimizers at specific mass and momentum values. Numerical experiments confirmed this relationship for both focusing and defocusing cases.

Conclusion: Successfully established theoretical correspondence and developed effective numerical method for computing standing wave solutions, demonstrating that profile ODE solutions serve as energy minimizers under appropriate constraints.

Abstract: We study the quasi-periodic standing wave solutions of the focusing and
defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations in dimension one. In the
defocusing case, we establish a diffeomorphic correspondence between the
invariants of the ordinary differential equation of the wave profiles and the
conserved quantities of the evolution equation. We introduce a numerical scheme
to compute the minimizers of the energy at fixed mass and momentum for both
focusing and defocusing cases. The scheme is based on a gradient flow approach
with discrete renormalization at each time step. The novelty of our scheme is
that the renormalization step deals at the same time with the mass and the
momentum constraints. In numerical experiments, we observe that a given
solution of the profile ordinary differential equation is also a minimizer of
the energy at corresponding mass and momentum.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper constructs multi-soliton solutions for the energy critical wave equation in 5D and proves their collisions are inelastic under certain parameter conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous multi-soliton constructions to fully account for spatial dimensions and arbitrary soliton directions, enabling analysis of collision dynamics.

Method: Revisits unidirectional multi-soliton constructions with a more general approach that incorporates dimension effects and arbitrary movement directions of solitons.

Result: Successfully constructs multi-solitons with any number of solitons, arbitrary signs, speeds, scaling and translation parameters in 5D.

Conclusion: The construction proves that soliton collisions are inelastic under non-cancellation assumptions on parameters, building on previous analytical arguments.

Abstract: For the focusing, energy critical wave equation in dimension 5, we construct
multi-solitons with any number of solitons, any choice of signs, speeds,
scaling parameters and translation parameters. This requires to revisit in
depth previous constructions of multi-solitons based on a unidirectional
approach, to fully take into account the dimension of the space and the
possibility for solitons to move in any direction.
  Then, as a consequence of this more general construction and of the arguments
developed in a previous article, the inelastic nature of any collision of
solitons is proved under a non-cancellation assumption on the parameters.

### [15] [Classical Euler flows generate the strong Guderley imploding shock wave](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19688)
*Giorgio Cialdea,Steve Shkoller,Vlad Vicol*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for compressible Euler equations arises from smooth initial data, develops a preshock singularity, forms a shock that grows to match Guderley's solution, and provides global-in-time evolution including reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the connection between classical smooth initial data and the well-known Guderley self-similar imploding shock solution, showing how such singular solutions emerge from regular conditions.

Method: Analysis of radially symmetric compressible Euler equations with ideal gas law, tracking evolution from smooth initial data through preshock formation to shock development and matching with Guderley's self-similar profile.

Result: Proved that smooth initial data evolves to form a preshock with C^{1/3} cusp, develops a unique shock that grows to match Guderley's solution exactly on a controlled time interval, and provides global evolution including implosion and reflection.

Conclusion: Guderley's imploding shock solution can be realized from classical smooth initial data, with a complete description of the transition from regularity to singularity and subsequent global evolution.

Abstract: We prove that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for the
compressible Euler equations with ideal--gas law ($\gamma>1$) arises from
classical, radially symmetric, shock--free data. For such data prescribed at
initial time $\mathrm{T_{in}} < 0$, we prove that the flow remains smooth up to
a first singular time $t=\mathrm{T}_* \in (\mathrm{T_{in}}, 0)$, where a
preshock forms with a $C^{1/3}$ cusp in the fast acoustic variable. From this
preshock a unique, initially weak, regular shock is born, whose strength can be
made arbitrarily large on a controlled time interval; the front then deforms
onto the Guderley shock and implodes at the origin at the collapse time $t=0$.
There exists a matching time $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}} \in (\mathrm{T}_*,0)$ such
that on $[\mathrm{T_{fin}},0)$ the solution coincides exactly with the
classical Guderley self--similar profile, and at $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}}$ the shock
trajectory matches the self--similar front to all orders. As $t \to 0^-$, the
Euler solution implodes at the center, and continues for $t>0$ as a reflected
blast wave, providing a global-in-time unique Euler solution which evolves from
regular initial conditions.

TL;DR: A topology optimization framework for water-cooled heat sinks with voided lattice structures using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model to reduce pressure drops while improving thermal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional porous heat sinks suffer from excessive pressure drops due to intricate geometries, limiting practical applicability. The study aims to overcome this limitation by incorporating void regions and graded lattice density.

Method: Multi-material topology optimization with explicit representation of void and porous regions, using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model for reduced-order simulations. Optimized designs are reconstructed into full-scale lattice geometries and validated through coupled thermo-fluid finite element analyses.

Result: Voided lattice configurations achieved approximately 20-30% higher maximum Nusselt numbers compared to conventional plate-fin and uniform lattice heat sinks, while maintaining lower pressure losses under fixed pressure-drop conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed voided lattice heat sink design significantly outperforms conventional designs by simultaneously improving thermal performance and reducing pressure drops, demonstrating the effectiveness of the topology optimization framework.

Abstract: This study presents a topology optimization framework for the design of water
cooled heat sinks that incorporate voided lattice structures, formulated using
a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model. Conventional porous heat sinks often
suffer from excessive pressure drops due to their intricate geometries, which
limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, the proposed
method introduces an explicit representation of both void and porous regions,
together with graded lattice density, within a multi-material optimization
framework. The two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model enables efficient
reduced-order simulations, allowing direct consideration of the heterogeneous
porous-void distribution during the optimization process. The optimized designs
are reconstructed into full-scale lattice geometries and validated through
coupled thermo-fluid finite element analyses under fixed pressure-drop
conditions. The results demonstrate that the voided lattice configurations
significantly outperform conventional plate-fin and uniform lattice heat sinks,
achieving approximately 20-30 percent higher maximum Nusselt numbers while
maintaining lower pressure losses.

Result: Enables efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations by dynamically selecting simulation methods at runtime based on predicted discrepancies.

Conclusion: The MLP-based decision model successfully addresses computational scalability challenges in large-scale simulations through intelligent, localized method selection, providing an effective hybrid approach for multiscale simulations.

Abstract: All simulation approaches eventually face limits in computational scalability
when applied to large spatiotemporal domains. This challenge becomes especially
apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and
temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To
overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with
different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we
present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects
between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer
perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and
continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity
particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent
approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where
a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes
the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation
workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.

Motivation: To understand transport mechanisms in Wendelstein 7-X high-density-gradient regimes, which are crucial for achieving high-performance operation.

Method: Gyrokinetic simulations comparing simulated and experimentally measured heat and particle fluxes.

Result: Close agreement between simulations and experiments confirms MTM dominance; MTM emergence attributed to absence of competing instabilities, stabilizing magnetic configuration, moderate collisionality, and low magnetic shear.

Conclusion: MTM turbulence is the primary transport mechanism in W7-X high-density-gradient conditions, advancing understanding of these regimes essential for high-performance operation.

Abstract: Gyrokinetic simulations reveal that microtearing mode (MTM) turbulence
dominates transport in a Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) discharge characterized by
large density gradients, moderate temperature gradients, and low plasma beta.
This conclusion is supported by the close agreement between simulated and
experimentally measured heat and particle fluxes. The emergence of MTMs is
attributed to the absence of competing instabilities -- such as ion temperature
gradient modes and density-gradient-driven trapped-electron modes -- under
these plasma conditions, together with the stabilizing influence of the W7-X
max-J magnetic configuration. Furthermore, moderate collisionality and low
magnetic shear are found to facilitate MTM onset. These findings advance the
understanding of high-density-gradient regimes, which are essential for
achieving high-performance operation in W7-X plasmas.

TL;DR: Analytical derivation of how impurities modify ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) growth rates in stellarator plasmas, showing three physical mechanisms and correlation with nonlinear heat flux.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how impurities affect turbulent heat flux in stellarator plasmas by analytically deriving the modification of ITG growth rates.

Method: Analytical solution of ITG dispersion relation in impurity-containing plasma limits, derivation of growth rate modification expression, validation with linear gyrokinetic simulations.

Result: Derived analytical expression with three terms (density gradient, temperature gradient, dilution) correctly predicts growth rate modification and conditions for reduction/increase, correlates with nonlinear heat flux changes.

Conclusion: Analytical framework successfully explains impurity effects on ITG turbulence and provides predictive capability for impurity impact on stellarator plasma transport.

Abstract: Recent nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations have shown that impurities can
strongly modify the turbulent heat flux in stellarator plasmas. Here, the
ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) dispersion relation in a plasma containing
impurities is analytically solved in certain limits and an expression for the
modification of the ITG growth rate by impurities is derived. The analytical
expression is the sum of three terms corresponding to three different physical
causes (impurity density gradient, impurity temperature gradient and dilution)
of the change in the growth rate. The scalings predicted analytically for the
modification of the growth rate are shown to be reproduced by linear
gyrokinetic simulations. The conditions for reduction or increase of the ITG
growth by impurities are also correctly predicted by the analytical solution to
the dispersion relation. Finally, a remarkable correlation is found between the
analytical expression for the modification of the growth rate and the
modification of the turbulent heat flux obtained from nonlinear gyrokinetic
simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric tomography is crucial for improving image quality in ground-based telescopes like ELT's MORFEO instrument, requiring efficient numerical implementation.

Method: SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) using FFT and pre-computation of demanding parts to reduce memory requirements compared to Matrix Vector Multiplication approaches.

Result: SAFR achieves fast performance with reduced memory usage while maintaining reconstruction quality, validated through COMPASS simulations using MORFEO instrument parameters.

Conclusion: SAFR provides an efficient numerical implementation for atmospheric tomography that outperforms traditional MVM approaches in computational speed and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence
profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many
adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of
ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay
For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based
approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical
implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain
Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate
Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the
utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding
parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements
than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate
the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational
expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in
which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO
instrument of the ELT.

Motivation: Machine learning-assisted optimization methods have not consistently outperformed classical state-of-the-art methods in combinatorial optimization problems, particularly for QUBO problems like 3D Ising spin glasses.

Method: Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning, focusing on finding minimum energy configurations in 3D Ising spin glasses.

Result: Global Annealing surpasses Simulated Annealing performance and exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system sizes without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: This provides the first clear and robust evidence that machine learning-assisted optimization methods can exceed classical state-of-the-art techniques in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical
applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and
quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted
approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed
simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the
challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising
spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates
standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show
that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance.
Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we
demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of
Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population
Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size
without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the
first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization
method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in
a combinatorial optimization setting.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to incorporate lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) algorithms for 2D and 3D systems, using a transposition trick to preserve symmetry in key operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While global on-site symmetries have been incorporated in TNRG, lattice symmetries like reflection and rotation remain unclear. This work addresses the gap by developing methods for lattice-reflection symmetry as a first step toward handling more complex lattice symmetries.

Method: The authors define lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language and introduce a transposition trick to exploit and impose this symmetry in TNRG operators (projective truncations and entanglement filtering). They provide detailed algorithms for TNRG maps in 2D and 3D that preserve reflection symmetry.

Result: The method enables construction of linearized TNRG maps within specific lattice-reflection sectors, allowing separate extraction of scaling dimensions in each symmetry sector.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for incorporating lattice-reflection symmetry in TNRG and paves the way for understanding more complex lattice-rotation symmetries in future research.

Abstract: Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space
renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and
quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm
can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct
tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site
symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice
symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice
symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry
in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three
dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of
lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a
transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry
in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering.
Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both
2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and
imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG
maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes
possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work
paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.

Motivation: To investigate topological structures far from equilibrium in periodically driven systems and understand the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons.

Method: Study of a driven-dissipative φ⁴ model to observe time-crystalline soliton states, analyze their dynamics under noise, and examine soliton annihilation processes.

Result: Found TCS states that oscillate between kink and anti-kink configurations, discovered dynamical transitions between Z₂ symmetry-breaking phases under noise, and showed deconfined annihilation dynamics with power-law scaling of annihilation time.

Conclusion: Time-crystalline solitons exhibit deconfined dynamics despite the nonequilibrium nature of the system, in contrast to confined time-crystalline monopoles, with important implications for topological structures in driven systems.

Abstract: Periodical driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the
dynamics of topological structures far from equilibrium. In this paper, we
report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$
model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational
symmetry alongside spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton
pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We
further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk
can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking
time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of
two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the
confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett.
131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined
despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged
annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.

*Kai Chang,Themistoklis P. Sapsis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces η-learning (Extreme Event Aware learning), a method that reduces uncertainty in extreme event prediction without requiring extreme events in training data, using statistical regularization with observable statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven methods for predicting rare/extreme events assume multiple extreme events exist in training data, leading to high uncertainty in extreme regions when such events are absent from training data.

Method: η-learning enforces extreme event statistics of an observable indicative of extremeness during training, using statistical regularization to ensure model consistency with prescribed observable statistics even without extreme events in training data.

Result: The method reduces uncertainty in extreme event regions and enables generation of unprecedented extreme events when training data lack extremes. Theoretical justification via optimal transport and numerical experiments on prototype and real-world problems demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: η-learning provides a rigorous framework for extreme event prediction that overcomes limitations of existing methods by not requiring extreme events in training data, enabling reliable prediction in uncharted extreme regions.

Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.

neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

### [29] [HARPPP: Autonomous Geometric Design Optimisation of Stirred Tank Reactor Impellers and Baffles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19004)
*A. Leonard Nicusan,Darren Gobby,Kit Windows-Yule*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: HARPPP is an autonomous design loop that combines programmable geometry modeling, CFD simulation, and evolutionary search to optimize industrial process equipment like impellers, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial equipment design is slow and ad hoc, relying on engineers making small tweaks to standard shapes and building prototypes. There's a need for systematic optimization of complex geometries.

Method: HARPPP uses a compact programmable geometry model that reproduces all standard impellers as special cases, coupled with power-controlled CFD simulations and evolutionary search algorithms to explore large parameter spaces efficiently.

Result: The system explored a 23-parameter impeller-baffle space in 15 days (3000 simulations), discovering multiple design families that outperform Rushton/4-baffle baseline: intensity +18 to +78% and uniformity CoV -16 to -64%. A clear Pareto frontier emerged for application-specific optimization.

Conclusion: HARPPP provides a generalizable framework for autonomous equipment design optimization wherever credible physics models exist, enabling systematic discovery of superior designs beyond traditional approaches.

Abstract: Designing and optimising the geometry of industrial process equipment remains
slow and still largely ad hoc: engineers make small tweaks to one standard
shape at a time, build prototypes, and hope for gains. We introduce HARPPP, an
autonomous design loop that couples a compact, programmable geometry model to
power-controlled CFD and evolutionary search. The geometry model is a single
mathematical description that reproduces every standard impeller as a special
case while spanning an unlimited set of manufacturable shapes. Working with
Johnson Matthey on an industrial vessel, HARPPP explored a 23-parameter
impeller-baffle space at constant power (3024 W), executing 3,000 simulation
cycles in 15 days. The search uncovered multiple design families that
outperform a Rushton/4-baffle baseline in both mixing intensity and uniformity,
including twisted-plate impellers and pitched/curved baffles (intensity +18 to
+78 percent; uniformity CoV -16 to -64 percent). A clear intensity-uniformity
Pareto frontier emerged, enabling application-specific choices. Because HARPPP
treats the simulator as the objective, it generalises to other equipment
wherever credible physics models exist.

### [30] [Resonance-induced nonlinear bound states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19538)
*Jackson C. Turner,Michael I. Weinstein*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies nonlinear bound states in 1D nonlinear Schrödinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equations with compactly supported linear potentials, showing they can bifurcate not only from L² bound states but also from scattering resonance states and transmission resonance states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of nonlinear bound state formation beyond traditional bifurcation from L² bound states, exploring how resonance states (non-decaying and only locally L²) can also give rise to nonlinear bound states.

Method: Analysis of 1D NLS/GP equations with compactly supported linear potentials, studying bifurcation from scattering resonance states (associated with poles of reflection coefficients) and transmission resonance states (associated with zeros of reflection coefficients).

Result: Proved that nonlinear bound states arise via bifurcation from both scattering resonance states and transmission resonance states, with these bifurcations initiating at a strictly positive L² threshold determined by the position of complex scattering resonance poles or transmission resonance zeros.

Conclusion: The work extends the classical bifurcation theory by showing that nonlinear bound states in 1D NLS/GP can originate from resonance states (not just L² bound states), with distinct threshold behavior determined by complex resonance positions.

Abstract: We study nonlinear bound states -- time-harmonic and spatially decaying
($L^2$) solutions -- of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger / Gross--Pitaevskii
equations (NLS/GP) with a compactly supported linear potential. Such solutions
are known to bifurcate from the $L^2$ bound states of an underlying
Schr\"odinger operator $H_V=-\partial_x^2+V$. In this article we prove an
extension of this result: for the 1D NLS/GP, nonlinear bound states also arise
via bifurcation from the scattering resonance states and transmission resonance
states of $H_V$, associated with the poles and zeros, respectively, of the
reflection coefficients, $r_\pm(k)$, of $H_V$. The corresponding resonance
states are non-decaying and only $L^2_{\rm loc}$. In contrast to nonlinear
states arising from $L^2$ bound states of $H_V$, these resonance bifurcations
initiate at a strictly positive $L^2$ threshold which is determined by the
position of the complex scattering resonance pole or transmission resonance
zero.

TL;DR: Analysis of neutrino-driven MHD waves in rotating magnetoplasma showing coupling between shear Alfvén and magnetosonic waves via Coriolis force, with instabilities from neutrino beam interactions and flavor oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in rotating magnetized plasmas, particularly relevant to core-collapse supernovae where neutrino interactions play crucial roles.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MHD waves with weak neutrino interactions, examining coupling between shear Alfvén and oblique magnetosonic waves through Coriolis force, and studying resonant interactions with streaming neutrino beam and flavor oscillations.

Result: Discovered new wave modes affected by Coriolis force, neutrino beam, and flavor oscillations; identified instabilities from resonant interactions; found significant impact of Coriolis force, plasma density, and magnetic field strength on instability growth rates.

Conclusion: This work extends previous theories by incorporating neutrino effects on shear Alfvén waves and provides new insights into physical mechanisms in core-collapse supernovae through the identified instabilities and wave couplings.

Abstract: We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and
instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions. We
show, for the first time, that neutrino-driven shear Alfv{\'e}n and oblique
magnetosonic waves can be coupled by the Coriolis force, forming new wave modes
affected by this force, as well as neutrino beam and two neutrino flavor
oscillations. Our work extends previous theories by demonstrating that shear
Alfv{\'e}n waves are influenced by neutrino effects and by identifying
instabilities resulting from resonant interactions with both a streaming
neutrino beam and flavor oscillations. We find that the Coriolis force, as well
as plasma density and magnetic field strength, have a significant impact on the
profiles of the instability growth rates. Our findings may shed new light on
the physical mechanisms underlying core-collapse supernovae.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking for quantum many-body systems is hindered by massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or quantum Monte Carlo simulations at finite temperatures.

Method: Proposed a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states, implemented in an open-source C++ template library (Physica) with improved algorithm and state-of-the-art software engineering.

Result: For the 4x4 Hubbard model, the method runs approximately 1000 times faster than HΦ 3.5.2 and extends accessible temperature range down to β=32 across arbitrary doping levels.

Conclusion: These advances significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: The development of novel quantum many-body computational algorithms relies on
robust benchmarking. However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by
the massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or
quantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this
work, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states,
which allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic
properties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our
open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm
with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high
performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the
$4 \times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster
than $\mathcal{H}\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is
extended down to $\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels. These advances
significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body
systems.

TL;DR: UEIPNet is an equivariant graph neural network that predicts interatomic potentials and tight-binding Hamiltonians, enabling accurate modeling of mechanical-electronic coupling in atomic structures with near-DFT accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework that bridges classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations, enabling efficient study of deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomic systems.

Method: Uses equivariant graph neural network trained on DFT calculations with Wannier projection, predicting energies/forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets.

Result: Successfully captures deformation-electronic effects in bilayer graphene (flat-band formation) and monolayer MoS2 (phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, local density of states modulations).

Conclusion: UEIPNet provides a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling, bridging atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.

Abstract: We introduce UEIPNet, an equivariant graph neural network designed to predict
both interatomic potentials and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians for an atomic
structure. The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations
followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level
targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables
physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with
near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data,
UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer
graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane
corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that
modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away
from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces
phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of
states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized,
efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling
in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and
electronic-structure calculations.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: X-type antiferromagnets are a new class of materials that generate highly efficient T-odd spin currents with up to 90% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, outperforming altermagnets and other magnetic materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover materials that can generate efficient spin splitting while maintaining zero net magnetization, addressing limitations of existing altermagnets and other magnetic systems.

Method: Analysis of β-Fe₂PO₅ with (110) orientation, examining Fermi surface geometry and Néel vector orientation effects on spin current generation.

Result: X-type antiferromagnets achieve 90% charge-to-spin conversion efficiency and generate out-of-plane spin-polarized currents that substantially exceed efficiencies of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, and other magnetic materials.

Conclusion: X-type antiferromagnets provide a novel and highly effective spin source system for developing low-power spintronic devices due to their exceptional charge-spin conversion capabilities.

Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest for their capacity to
generate spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization. This work
proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type
antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to
their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is
controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented
$\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave
altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately
X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover,
when the N\'eel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the
system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies
substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear
antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin
conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective
spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the insufficiently studied effects of rare-earth element doping and substitution on magnetic and electric properties of RECrO3 materials for multifunctional device applications.

Method: Employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on experimental and literature data to predict physical properties including Neel temperature, remanent polarization, and piezoelectric coefficients under various doping scenarios.

Result: Identified that specific RE element doping significantly impacts Neel temperature, with optimal doping levels found for enhanced performance. High-entropy RECrO3 compounds showed systematic influence on magnetic properties.

Conclusion: Established a robust framework for predicting and optimizing RECrO3 properties, providing valuable insights for energy storage and sensor technology applications.

Abstract: Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$),
have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and
electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional
devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\acute{\textrm{e}}$el
temperature, $T_\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the
effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these
properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of
RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature
data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate
predictions of $T_\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\textrm{r}$)
and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping
with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\textrm{N}$, with optimal
doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy
RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the
inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work
establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of
RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential
applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based registration methods often overlook regularization's critical role in ensuring robustness and anatomical plausibility, leading to non-physical artifacts like folding.

Method: Proposes DARE framework with dynamic elastic regularization adjustment based on deformation field gradient norm, integrating adaptive strain and shear energy terms with folding-prevention mechanism using negative Jacobian penalty.

Result: The approach mitigates non-physical artifacts, avoids over-smoothing, and improves both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: DARE provides a robust registration framework that balances stability and flexibility through adaptive regularization while ensuring physically realistic transformations.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians using exact kinetic energy operators and general potential energy surfaces, achieving exponential reductions in qubit count and T-gate complexity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient quantum algorithms for molecular rovibrational simulations that overcome limitations of classical methods and existing quantum approaches, particularly addressing the computational challenges of high-dimensional systems.

Method: Integrates exact curvilinear kinetic energy operators with potential energy surfaces in hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. Uses quantum read-only memory based on Walsh-Hadamard transform to encode Hamiltonian as unitary quantum circuit for quantum phase estimation.

Result: Achieves exponential reductions in logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity relative to existing block-encoding techniques. For water spectrum, quantum volume reduced by 10^5 times, increasing to 10^6 for 30-dimensional system. Enables spectroscopic-accuracy energy level estimation in 3 months on 1MHz quantum processor versus 30,000 years on classical supercomputer.

Conclusion: The method provides significant asymptotic advantages for quantum simulation of molecular rovibrational systems, though realizing these advantages requires substantial quantum resources and continued algorithmic development.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating rovibrational Hamiltonians on
fault-tolerant quantum computers. The method integrates exact curvilinear
kinetic energy operators and general-form potential energy surfaces expressed
in a hybrid finite-basis/discrete-variable representation. The Hamiltonian is
encoded as a unitary quantum circuit using a quantum read-only memory
construction based on the Walsh--Hadamard transform, enabling high-accuracy
quantum phase estimation of rovibrational energy levels. Our technique provides
asymptotic reductions in both logical-qubit count and T-gate complexity that
are exponential in the number of atoms and at least polynomial in the total
Hilbert-space size, relative to existing block-encoding techniques based on
linear combinations of unitaries. Compared with classical variational methods,
it offers exponential memory savings and polynomial reductions in time
complexity. The quantum volume required for computing the rovibrational
spectrum of water can be reduced by up to $10^{5}$ times compared with other
quantum methods, increasing to at least $10^{6}$ for a 30-dimensional (12-atom)
model system. For this case with a six-body coupled potential, estimating
spectroscopic-accuracy energy levels would require about three months on a
$1~\mathrm{MHz}$ fault-tolerant quantum processor with fewer than 300 logical
qubits, versus over 30,000 years on the fastest current classical
supercomputer. These estimates are approximate and subject to technological
uncertainties, and realizing the asymptotic advantage will require substantial
quantum resources and continued algorithmic progress.

Motivation: The observational leap from JWST and new facilities has exposed critical deficiencies in existing molecular collisional databases needed for accurate astrophysical modeling.

Method: Outlines recent developments in theoretical methods and approximations to extend coverage of collisional coefficients for molecular systems and physical environments.

Result: Identifies two major frontiers: characterization of heavy projectile collisions and treatment of ro-vibrational excitation, emphasizing the need for robust computational approaches.

Conclusion: Significant computational effort is required to develop reliable theoretical methods that can expand collisional databases to meet the demands of modern astrophysical observations.

Abstract: This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular
scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent
years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and
provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However,
the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has
revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major
frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy
projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant
computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and
develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the
census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical
modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular
attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of

Motivation: To extend the study of dispersive hydrodynamics and nonlinear wave physics into the high-intensity charged particle beam regime, providing a new experimental platform.

Method: Used the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) to generate a localized induction-cell perturbation creating a negative density pulse, then observed its evolution into DSW structure.

Result: Observed leading soliton-like peak with proper scaling laws (width^2 vs inverse amplitude, velocity vs amplitude) and linear expansion of wave-train width over time, consistent with KdV theory. Successive peaks showed decreasing amplitude and velocity toward trailing edge.

Conclusion: Intense charged particle beams serve as a new laboratory platform for studying dispersive hydrodynamics, successfully demonstrating DSW formation and KdV-type nonlinear wave behavior in high-intensity beam regime.

Abstract: Dispersive shock waves (DSWs) are expanding nonlinear wave trains that arise
when dispersion regularizes a steepening front, a phenomenon observed in
fluids, plasmas, optics, and superfluids. Here we report the first experimental
observation of DSWs in an intense electron beam, using the University of
Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). A localized induction-cell perturbation produced
a negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed
by an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton
scaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while
the total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with
Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions. Successive peaks showed decreasing
amplitude and velocity toward the trailing edge, in agreement with dispersive
shock ordering. These results demonstrate that intense charged particle beams
provide a new laboratory platform for studying dispersive hydrodynamics,
extending nonlinear wave physics into the high-intensity beam regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand correlation effects in fermionic cold atom systems with dipolar interactions, specifically investigating the stability of itinerant ferromagnetism in 2D homogeneous Fermi fluids.

Method: Fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate energy data for both ferromagnetic (one-component) and paramagnetic (two-component) 2D Fermi fluids with repulsive dipolar interactions.

Result: Itinerant ferromagnetism was found to be unstable within the studied parameter spaces for both softened and unsoftened dipolar interactions.

Conclusion: The energy parameterizations developed will enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.

Abstract: Fermionic cold atoms in optical traps provide viable quantum simulators of
correlation effects in electronic systems. For dressed Rydberg atoms in
two-dimensional traps with out-of-plane dipole moments, a realistic model of
the pairwise interaction is of repulsive dipolar $1/r^3$ form at long range,
softened to a constant at short range. This study provides parameterizations of
fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo energy data for ferromagnetic (one-component)
and paramagnetic (two-component) two-dimensional homogeneous Fermi fluids of
interacting dipolar atoms. We find itinerant ferromagnetism to be unstable
within our parameter spaces for dipolar interactions both with and without
softening. Our parameterization of the energy as a function of density will
enable density functional theory to support experimental studies of
inhomogeneous fermionic cold atom systems.
