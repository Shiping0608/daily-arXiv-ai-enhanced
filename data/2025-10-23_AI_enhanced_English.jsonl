In this paper, we\nreport a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\\phi^4$\nmodel.

During time evolution, the soliton\npattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We\nfurther study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk\ncan induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking\ntime-crystalline phases in time domain.
