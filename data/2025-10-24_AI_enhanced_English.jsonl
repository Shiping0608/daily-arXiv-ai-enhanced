In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices\nin the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine\nmethods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical\nform, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations.\nTwo key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for\nefficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in\nclassical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b)\nlow-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and\nstate preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially\nequivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our\nconstructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously\nmultiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an\nalgorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in\nthe standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli\nmatrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper systematically studies quantum circuit representations for matrices, focusing on block encodings and state preparation circuits.

Our\nmain contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions\nof the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic\nsystem of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit\ncharacterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a\nfunction space. This framework provides a transparent description of local\nbifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while\naccommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that\ncharacterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,\nsubcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple\nFourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also\ncharacterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the\nstationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of\nFourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity\nproperties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and\ncoexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying\ndiscontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the\nminimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the\nNoisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse\ntemperature parameter $\\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many\nbifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\\beta$\ncan lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which\ncan be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous\nto discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\\beta$ increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle using Fourier analysis, revealing an exact equivalence between solutions and infinite-dimensional quadratic systems, enabling explicit characterization of bifurcations and phase transitions.", "motivation": "To provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing stationary states of McKean-Vlasov equations, particularly focusing on bifurcations, phase transitions, and the structure of solutions in Fourier space rather than function space.", "method": "Establishes an exact equivalence between stationary McKean-Vlasov solutions and infinite-dimensional quadratic systems over Fourier coefficients, enabling explicit characterization in sequence space.

Our analysis follows the\nasymptotically hyperboloidal-Euclidean framework introduced by LeFloch and Y.\nMa for the massive Klein-Gordon-Einstein system.

In contrast with prior approaches, our treatment of spinor fields\nand the Dirac equation is gauge-invariant, relying on the formalism of Lorentz\nClifford algebras, principal fiber bundles, etc. Our analysis is carried out\nwith the metric expressed in light-bending wave coordinates, as we call them.\nThis leads us to the study of a global existence problem for a system of wave\nequations with constraints and a Klein-Gordon-type equations.
