In fact these models\nlearn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,\nhowever the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by\nproposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a\nknown physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained\nto traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We\nimplement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow\nsteps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.\n  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising\nconfigurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that\nperforms temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete\nIsing states while preserving physical constraints.\n  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it\npreserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed\nas the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each\nvector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising\nmodel's latent space.

Under suitable\nregularity assumptions on the quasilinear structure and a superlinear growth\ncondition near zero for the semilinear part, it is shown that the initial state\ncan be uniquely recovered from small time averages taken over an arbitrary time\nperiod. The applicability of the result is demonstrated for certain chemotaxis\nmodels and reaction-diffusion systems."}

We prove that under suitable conditions, the MLP approximation\novercomes the curse of dimensionality in the following sense: To approximate\nthe value function and its gradient evaluated at a given time and state to\nwithin a prescribed accuracy $\\varepsilon$, the computational complexity grows\nat most polynomially in the problem dimension $d$ and $1/\\varepsilon$. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of the scheme, we carry out numerical experiments\nfor a class of test problems that are related to the dynamic scheduling problem\nof parallel server systems in heavy traffic, and demonstrate that the scheme is\ncomputationally feasible up to dimension at least $20$."}
