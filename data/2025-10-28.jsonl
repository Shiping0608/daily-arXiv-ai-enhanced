The system dynamics are governed by the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes\n(CHNS) equations, discretized with mixed finite elements and implicit\ntime-stepping. Spatial accuracy is controlled throughout the simulation by the\n\\emph{global transient fixed-point method} from Alauzet \\emph{et al.}, in which\nthe simulation time is divided into sub-intervals, each associated with an\nadapted anisotropic mesh. The simulation is run in a fixed-point loop until\nconvergence of each mesh--solution pair. Each iteration takes advantage of the\npreviously computed solution and accurately predicts the flow variations. This\nensures that the mesh always captures the fluid-fluid interface, and allows for\na dynamic control of the interface thickness at a fraction of the computational\ncost compared to uniform or isotropic grids. Moreover, using a modest number of\ntime sub-intervals reduces the transfer error from one mesh to another, which\nwould otherwise eventually spoil the numerical solution. The overall adaptive\nprocedure is verified with manufactured solutions and the well-known rising\nbubble benchmark."}

Under step forcing, these moments\nreach statistical equilibrium in finite time. However, the transitional phase\nbefore equilibrium and cases with time-dependent forcing are required to\npredict flow in engineering applications. Computing these moments is expensive\nbecause the integrands are highly oscillatory, even when the bubble dynamics\nare linear. Ensemble-averaged models compute these moments at each grid point\nand time step, making cost reduction important for large-scale bubbly flow\nsimulations. Traditional methods evaluate the integrals via traditional\nquadrature rules. This approach requires a large number of quadrature nodes in\nthe equilibrium bubble size, each equipped with its own advection partial\ndifferential equation (PDE), resulting in significant computational expense. We\nformulate a Levin collocation method to reduce this cost. Given the\ndifferential equation associated with the integrand, or moment, the method\napproximates it by evaluating its derivative via polynomial collocation. The\ndifferential matrix and amplitude function are well-suited to numerical\ndifferentiation via collocation, and so the computation is comparatively cheap.\nFor an example excited polydisperse bubble population, the first moment is\ncomputed with the presented method at $10^{-3}$ relative error with 100 times\nfewer quadrature nodes than the trapezoidal rule. The gap increases for smaller\ntarget relative errors: the Levin method requires $10^4$ times fewer points for\na relative error of $10^{-8}$.

A\nkey bottleneck is the construction of Jacobian matrices for the associated\nalgebraic equations; although numerical approximations can avoid explicit\nanalytical derivation, they become unreliable and computationally expensive for\nlarge-scale or non-smooth problems.

This undermines\nreproducibility, misguides resource allocation, and obscures scientific\nprogress. To address this, we propose a Common Task Framework (CTF) for\nscientific machine learning. The CTF features a curated set of datasets and\ntask-specific metrics spanning forecasting, state reconstruction, and\ngeneralization under realistic constraints, including noise and limited data.\nInspired by the success of CTFs in fields like natural language processing and\ncomputer vision, our framework provides a structured, rigorous foundation for\nhead-to-head evaluation of diverse algorithms. As a first step, we benchmark\nmethods on two canonical nonlinear systems: Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Lorenz.\nThese results illustrate the utility of the CTF in revealing method strengths,\nlimitations, and suitability for specific classes of problems and diverse\nobjectives. Next, we are launching a competition around a global real world sea\nsurface temperature dataset with a true holdout dataset to foster community\nengagement. Our long-term vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with\nstandardized evaluations on hidden test sets that raise the bar for rigor and\nreproducibility in scientific ML."}

To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like\ninitialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial\nimprovements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of\ncPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce\nResidual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in\ndeep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical\ntests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully\ntraverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the\ndiffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward\nPDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components\ndemonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and\nPirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in\nsettings where the others diverge."}
