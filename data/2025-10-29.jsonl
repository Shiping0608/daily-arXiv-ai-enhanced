In this study, we introduce a\nphysics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution\nIndependent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,\naddressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but\nsufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent\nembedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained\nbasis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal\ncoordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are\nenforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation\nand performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical\nexamples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at\nvarying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations."}

Fully resolving large-scale\nturbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally\nprohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this\nwork, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)\narchitecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy\nof spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We\nintroduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and\nsubgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.\nWe create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train\nEddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x\nspeedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in\ntraining, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy\nspectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain\ngeneralization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,\nEddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately\nreproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions."}

Such optimization problems can often be reformulated as\nfixed-point problems for certain operators, which are then solved using\niterative methods based on the same operator, including the KM iteration, to\nultimately obtain the solution to the original optimization problem. Prior to\ndeveloping TKMA, we first introduce a KM iteration enhanced with adaptive\nmomentum, derived from geometric properties of an averaged nonexpansive\noperator T, KM acceleration technique, and information from the composite\noperator T^2. The proposed TKMA is constructed as a convex combination of this\nadaptive-momentum KM iteration and the Picard iteration of T^2. We establish\nthe convergence of the sequence generated by TKMA to a fixed point of T.\nMoreover, under specific assumptions on the adaptive momentum parameters, we\nprove that the algorithm achieves an o(1/k^{1/2}) convergence rate in terms of\nthe distance between successive iterates. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat TKMA outperforms the FPPA, PGA, Fast KM algorithm, and Halpern algorithm\non tasks such as image denoising and low-rank matrix completion."}
