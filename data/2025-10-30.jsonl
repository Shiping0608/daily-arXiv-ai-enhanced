The proposed scheme retains\nthe high-order accuracy of semi-Lagrangian methods, ensuring stability for\nlarge time steps and avoiding dimensional splitting errors. The primary\ncontribution of this paper is the novel extension of the algorithm from the\nmatrix to the high-dimensional tensor setting, which enables the simulation of\nVlasov models in up to six dimensions. The key technical components include (1)\na third-order high-dimensional polynomial reconstruction that scales as\n$O(d^2)$, providing a point-wise approximation of the solution at the foot of\ncharacteristics in a semi-Lagrangian scheme; (2) a recursive hierarchical\nadaptive cross approximation of high-order tensors in a hierarchical Tucker\nformat, characterized by a tensor tree; (3) a low-complexity Poisson solver in\nthe hierarchical Tucker format that leverages the FFT for efficiency. The\ncomputed adaptive rank kinetic solutions exhibit low-rank structures within\nbranches of the tensor tree resulting in substantial computational savings in\nboth storage and time. The resulting algorithm achieves a computational\ncomplexity of $O(d^4 N r^{3+\\lceil\\log_2d\\rceil})$, where $N$ is the number of\ngrid points per dimension, $d$ is the problem dimension, and $r$ is the maximum\nrank in the tensor tree, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Through\nextensive numerical tests, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm and highlight its ability to capture complex solution structures\nwhile maintaining a computational complexity that scales linearly with $N$."}

This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank\napproximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a\ndata-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius\nnorm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or\nunder-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,\ncaptures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility\nguarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds\nfor symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem\nand explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and\nnorm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\|(A + E)_p - A_p\\|$,\nwhere $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up\nto a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility\nguarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the\nliterature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from\ncomplex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,\nincluding polynomials and matrix exponentials.
