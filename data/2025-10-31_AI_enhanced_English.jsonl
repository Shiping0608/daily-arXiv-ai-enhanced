However, challenges\nremain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads\nto high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that\nscale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant\ninference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nMixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a\nsparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while\ncontrolling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise\nrouter-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert\nnetworks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific\nfeatures. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture\ncommon properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final\noutput is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated\nexperts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE\ndatasets.
