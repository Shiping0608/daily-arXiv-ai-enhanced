The method advances\nhigh-resolution schemes by combining the efficiency of linear reconstruction\nwith the robustness of nonlinear formulations, activated only when needed\nthrough a novel a priori detection strategy. This minimizes the use of costly\nCompact Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (CWENOZ) or Monotonic\nUpstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstructions,\nreducing computational cost without compromising accuracy or stability. The\nframework merges CWENOZ and the Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection\n(MOOD) paradigm while introducing a redesigned Numerical Admissibility Detector\n(NAD) that classifies the local flow into smooth, weakly non-smooth, and\ndiscontinuous regions in a single step. Each region is then reconstructed using\nan optimal method: a high-order linear scheme in smooth areas, CWENOZ in weakly\nnon-smooth zones, and a second-order MUSCL near discontinuities. This targeted\na priori allocation preserves high-order accuracy where possible and ensures\nstable, non-oscillatory behavior near shocks and steep gradients. Implemented\nwithin the open-source unstructured finite-volume solver UCNS3D, the framework\nsupports arbitrary-order reconstructions on mixed-element meshes. Extensive\ntwo- and three-dimensional benchmarks confirm that it retains the designed\naccuracy in smooth regions while greatly improving robustness in\nshock-dominated flows. Thanks to the reduced frequency of nonlinear\nreconstructions, the method achieves up to 2.5x speed-up over a CWENOZ scheme\nof equal order in 3D compressible turbulence. This hybrid approach thus brings\nhigh-order accuracy closer to industrial-scale CFD through its balance of\nefficiency, robustness, and reliability."}

Using Hartree-Fock simulations on\ncanonical 3D clusters from the tetrahedron (Z = 3) to the FCC lattice (Z = 12),\nat and near half-filling, we uncover three fundamental design principles. (i)\nGeometric Hierarchy: The resilience to Coulomb repulsion U is dictated by the\ncoordination number Z, which controls kinetic delocalization. (ii) Orbital\nHybridization: Counter-intuitively, inter-orbital hopping t_orb acts not as a\nsimple suppressor of pairing, but as a sophisticated control knob that enhances\ndouble occupancy at moderate U by engineering the on-site energy landscape.\n(iii) Field Squeezing: An electric field robustly induces pairing by forcing\ncharge localization, an effect most potent in low-connectivity clusters. These\nprinciples form a blueprint for deterministically targeting charge and spin\ncorrelations in quantum-dot-based quantum hardware."}

In order to extract\nproperties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF\nneeds to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al.

The standard parareal algorithm often suffers from slow convergence\nwhen applied to problems with stochastic inputs, primarily due to the poor\nquality of the initial guess. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid\nparallel algorithm, termed KLE-CGC, which integrates the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve\n(KL) expansion with the coarse grid correction (CGC). The method first employs\nthe KL expansion to achieve a low-dimensional parameterization of\nhigh-dimensional stochastic parameter fields. Subsequently, a generalized\nPolynomial Chaos (gPC) spectral surrogate model is constructed to enable rapid\nprediction of the solution field. Utilizing this prediction as the initial\nvalue significantly improves the initial accuracy for the parareal iterations.\nA rigorous convergence analysis is provided, establishing that the proposed\nframework retains the same theoretical convergence rate as the standard\nparareal algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that KLE-CGC maintains\nthe same convergence order as the original algorithm while substantially\nreducing the number of iterations and improving parallel scalability."}

However, challenges\nremain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads\nto high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that\nscale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant\ninference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nMixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a\nsparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while\ncontrolling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise\nrouter-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert\nnetworks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific\nfeatures. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture\ncommon properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final\noutput is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated\nexperts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE\ndatasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%\nreduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated\nparameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that\ndataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which\nvalidates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture."}

In this regime, a well-known feature of\nthe TDGL equation is the appearance of quantized vortices with core size of\norder $\\epsilon$. Moreover, in the singular limit $\\epsilon \\searrow 0$, these\nvortices evolve according to an explicit ODE system. In this work, we first\nintroduce a new numerical method for the numerical integration of this limiting\nODE system, which requires to solve a linear second order PDE at each time\nstep. We also provide a rigorous theoretical justification for this method that\napplies to a general class of 2D domains. We then develop and analyze a\nnumerical strategy based on the finite-dimensional ODE system to efficiently\nsimulate the infinite-dimensional TDGL equations in the presence of a constant\nexternal magnetic field and for small, but finite, $\\epsilon$. This method\nallows us to avoid resolving the $\\epsilon$-scale when solving the TDGL\nequations, where small values of $\\epsilon$ typically require very fine meshes\nand time steps. We provide numerical examples on a few test cases and justify\nthe accuracy of the method with numerical investigations."}

In the modeling\nphase, the governing equation of heat transfer by conduction is reconstructed\nthrough equation discovery using fractional-order derivatives, enabling the\nidentification of the fractional derivative order that best describes the\nphysical behavior. In the simulation phase, the thermal conductivity is treated\nas a physical parameter, and a parametric simulation is performed to analyze\nits influence on the temperature field. In the optimization phase, the focus is\nplaced on the inverse problem, where the goal is to infer unknown physical\nproperties from observed data. The effectiveness of the PINN approach is\nevaluated across these three fundamental engineering problem types and compared\nagainst conventional numerical methods. The results demonstrate that although\nPINNs may not yet outperform traditional numerical solvers in terms of speed\nand accuracy for forward problems, they offer a powerful and flexible framework\nfor parametric simulation, optimization, and equation discovery, making them\nhighly valuable for inverse and data-driven modeling applications."}

Invertible networks are\nattractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and\ninterpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural\nnetworks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator\nhave been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To\naddress this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network\ntraining that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical\nBayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior\nmean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis\ncharacterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its\ninverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and\ndemonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a\nstable and interpretable way."}
