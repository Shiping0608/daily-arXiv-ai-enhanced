However, challenges\nremain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads\nto high errors in mixed training.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nMixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a\nsparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while\ncontrolling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise\nrouter-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert\nnetworks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific\nfeatures.
