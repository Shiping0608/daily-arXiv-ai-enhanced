Operator learning aims to\napproximate mappings from input functions to output functions, where the latter\nare typically represented using basis functions. While non-learnable bases\nreduce training costs, learnable bases offer greater flexibility but often\nrequire deep network architectures with a large number of trainable parameters.\nExisting approaches typically rely on deep global bases; however, many PDE\nsolutions exhibit local behaviors such as shocks, sharp gradients, etc., and in\nparametrized PDE settings, these localized features may appear in different\nregions of the domain across different training and testing samples. Motivated\nby the use of local bases in finite element methods (FEM) for function\napproximation, we develop a shallow neural network architecture that constructs\nadaptive FEM bases. By adopting suitable activation functions, such as ReLU,\nthe FEM bases can be assembled exactly within the network, introducing no\nadditional approximation error in the basis construction process. This design\nenables the learning procedure to naturally mimic the adaptive refinement\nmechanism of FEM, allowing the network to discover basis functions tailored to\nintrinsic solution features such as shocks. The proposed learnable adaptive\nbases are then employed to represent the solution (output function) of the PDE.\nThis framework reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining\nhigh approximation accuracy, effectively combining the adaptivity of FEM with\nthe expressive power of operator learning. To evaluate performance, we validate\nthe proposed method on seven families of PDEs with diverse characteristics,\ndemonstrating its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness."}

In this work, we perform direct numerical\nsimulations of non-ideal, incompressible MRTI in both 2D and 3D, systematically\nvarying the magnetic field strength from weakly to strongly magnetized regimes.\nWe find that the 3D system exhibits richer mode interactions due to the\ncoexistence of interchange, undular, and mixed modes structures that are\ninherently absent in 2D.

The complex evolution of the flare\nincludes two distinct brightening episodes in the quasi-parallel ribbons,\ncorresponding to the two major peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) light curve. In\ncontrast, the brightening of semi-circular ribbons temporally coincides with\nthe local minimum between the two peaks. Using potential field extrapolation,\nwe reconstruct an incomplete dome-like magnetic structure with a negative\npolarity embedded within the northwestern part of the semi-circular positive\npolarity. Consequently, the magnetic configuration comprises two sets of field\nlines with distinct magnetic connectivities. We suggest that the standard flare\nreconnection accounts for the two-stage brightening of quasi-parallel ribbons\nassociated with the two HXR peaks. Between the two stages, this process is\nconstrained by the interaction of eruptive structures with the dome. The\ninteraction drives the quasi-separatrix layer reconnection, leading to the\nbrightening of semi-circular ribbons. It also suppresses the standard flare\nreconnection, resulting in a delayed second HXR peak."}

Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction.
