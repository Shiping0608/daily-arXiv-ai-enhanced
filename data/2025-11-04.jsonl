A key focus is on\nmitigating the oscillatory behavior often encountered in traditional spectral\nmethods while retaining high-order accuracy in smooth regions. We present a\nsystematic comparison between CWENO7-based and generalized polynomial chaos\n(gPC)-based approaches. Although gPC methods achieve spectral convergence, they\nare prone to Gibbs-type oscillations in nonsmooth settings. By contrast, CWENO7\nutilizes local stencils to achieve a balance: non-oscillatory behavior near\ndiscontinuities and high-order convergence in smooth regions. To validate the\napproach, we conduct numerical experiments on a range of one- and\ntwo-dimensional smooth and nonsmooth problems, including shallow water\nequations with random inputs. The results demonstrate that CWENO7 interpolation\nprovides accurate estimates of probability density functions, mean values, and\nstandard deviations, particularly in regimes where gPC expansions exhibit\nstrong oscillations. Furthermore, computational tests confirm that CWENO7\ninterpolation is efficient and scalable, establishing it as a reliable\nalternative to conventional stochastic collocation techniques for UQ in the\npresence of discontinuities."}

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable.

Beyond topological\nsuperconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined\nHyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba\nspin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and\nsymmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering\nunique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework\nto achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and\nspin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations.\nHyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit\nboundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba\neffect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential\nvector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy\nminimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} =\n0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from\nmode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants.\nThis study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of\ntopological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba\nspin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain\n(BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase\n(after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV {\\AA} and\n2.42 eV {\\AA}, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads\nto spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees\nof freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials."}

In the\nsecond layer, an additional more subtle mechanism is identified, potentially\ncapable of driving the scale of sparseness into the dissipation range and\npreventing the formation of a singularity.

The nonlinearly-stable flux\nreconstruction (NSFR) semi-discretization given in Eq. 7 with a suitable flux\nreconstruction scheme has been demonstrated to mitigate spurious oscillations\nin the presence of shock discontinuities and at CFL values substantially larger\nthan the DG variant of the NSFR scheme whilst retaining the property of entropy\nstability [5].

While the DC and DC-WME cost functions both involve a\npredictability-aware regularization term, the DC-WME function includes a\nmodification to the model-data misfit, thereby improving estimation accuracy,\nrobustness, and theoretical consistency in nonlinear and partially observed\ndynamical systems. Proofs are provided that establish the existence and\nuniqueness of the minimizer and analyze how a predictability assumption that is\ncommon within the DCI framework helps to promote solution stability. Numerical\nexperiments are presented on benchmark dynamical systems (Lorenz-63 and\nLorenz-96) as well as for the shallow water equations (SWE). In the benchmark\ndynamical systems, the DC-WME 4D-Var formulation is shown to consistently\noutperform standard 4D-Var in reducing both error and bias while maintaining\nrobustness under high observation noise and short assimilation windows. Despite\nintroducing modest computational overhead, DC-WME 4D-Var delivers improvements\nin estimation performance and forecast skill, demonstrating its potential\npracticality and scalability for high-dimensional data assimilation problems."}

Experimental evidence indicates that\nthree intrinsic material properties govern fracture nucleation in elastic\nmaterials: elasticity, strength, and fracture toughness. Among these, strength\nremains the most often misunderstood, as it is not a single scalar quantity but\nrather a full surface in stress space. The flexibility in defining this\nstrength envelope in phase-field models poses significant challenges,\nespecially under complex loading conditions. Existing models in the literature\noften fail to capture both the qualitative shape and the quantitative fit of\nexperimentally observed strength surfaces. To address this limitation, recent\nwork introduces a new energy functional within a cohesive phase-field\nframework, specifically designed to control the shape of elastic domains. This\nmodel introduces an internal variable to describe the inelastic response.\nNotably, the strength is decoupled from the internal length, that is not\ninterpreted as a material length scale, as often done in literature, but rather\nas a purely variational tool. The proposed functional allows for a rigorous\nvariational framework, enabling the use of tools from the calculus of\nvariations. We investigate the Gamma-convergence of the model to a sharp\ncohesive fracture energy in the one- and two-dimensional (anti-plane) setting,\nusing a finite element discrete formulation and exploiting the strong\nlocalization of the damage variable.

Our first main\nresult shows that the solution operator associated with a broad range of\n$2$BSDE families is approximable by appropriate neural operator models. We then\nidentify a structured subclass of (infinite) families of $2$BSDEs whose neural\noperator approximation requires only a polynomial number of parameters in the\nreciprocal approximation rate, as opposed to the exponential requirement in\ngeneral worst-case neural operator guarantees."}

Instead\nof being killed at the boundary, the process restarts from a random position\ninside the domain. We characterize this process through its stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE), its generator, and a description of the paths. We\nalso derive the invariant probability measure and the spectral representation.\nAt the end, we focus on the harmonic functions on the upper half-space to study\nthe trace process."}
