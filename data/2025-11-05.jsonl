PID decomposes the contribution of\ndifferent inputs to an output into unique information from each input,\nredundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges\nfrom combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons\nin classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the\ninformation in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between\nthe external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and\nunique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and\nperformance drops steeply.
