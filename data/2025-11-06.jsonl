In two or three\nspatial or feature dimensions, such problems can be approximated efficiently by\na class of matrices known as hierarchical matrices. A hierarchical matrix\nconsists of a hierarchy of small near-field blocks (or sub-matrices) stored in\na dense format and large far-field blocks approximated by low-rank matrices.\nStandard methods for forming hierarchical matrices do not account for the fact\nthat kernel matrices depend on specific hyperparameters; for example, in the\ncontext of Gaussian processes, hyperparameters must be optimized over a fixed\nparameter space. We introduce a new class of hierarchical matrices, namely,\nparametric (parameter-dependent) hierarchical matrices. Members of this new\nclass are parametric $\\mathcal{H}$-matrices and parametric\n$\\mathcal{H}^{2}$-matrices. The construction of a parametric hierarchical\nmatrix follows an offline-online paradigm. In the offline stage, the near-field\nand far-field blocks are approximated by using polynomial approximation and\ntensor compression. In the online stage, for a particular hyperparameter, the\nparametric hierarchical matrix is instantiated efficiently as a standard\nhierarchical matrix. The asymptotic costs for storage and computation in the\noffline stage are comparable to the corresponding standard approaches of\nforming a hierarchical matrix. However, the online stage of our approach\nrequires no new kernel evaluations, and the far-field blocks can be computed\nmore efficiently than standard approaches. {Numerical experiments show over\n$100\\times$ speedups compared with existing techniques.}"}

For\nelectronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a\npowerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation.

To this\nend, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native\nAGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for\nthe RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a\nspin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version\ndeveloped by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting\nimplementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when\nexecuted on multiple cores.

This achievement is largely\ndue to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than\nthree-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems\nis furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12\nmodel comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals.

We\nfurther extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological\nparameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although\nthe absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics\ndepends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the\nrelative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly\nconstant throughout."}

Calculating the e-ph\ncollision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains\ncomputationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This\nchallenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to\nachieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE\ncalculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm,\noptimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering\nchannels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach\nsignificantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and\nsynchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the\nopen-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach\nachieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics\non GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel\ndata structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering\nprocesses. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version\n(v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping\nstudies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum\nmaterials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms."}

We establish the existence and uniqueness of\nweak solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation within the class of\nnon-negative Radon measures, assuming that the initial data has a finite\nexponential moment. We first show that the forward dynamics of the dissipative\nparticle system is globally defined almost surely and then prove the weak$-*$\nconvergence of the microscopic solution towards the weak solutions of the\ninelastic linear Boltzmann equation, providing an explicit rate of convergence.\nFurthermore, under the same initial data assumptions, we prove the existence of\nstrong solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, constructed via a\nseries representation of the solutions."}
