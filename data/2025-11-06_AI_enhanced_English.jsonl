We numerically verify the\ncompleteness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin\nnoise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens\nfunction through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction\nenables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi\nmode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the\nsingle excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level\nsystem is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying\nthat radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework\nthus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population\nand single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then\npresent concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM\nframeworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify\nnumerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the\ncase of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in\na Fabry Perot cavity.

Calculating the e-ph\ncollision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains\ncomputationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This\nchallenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to\nachieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE\ncalculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm,\noptimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering\nchannels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach\nsignificantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and\nsynchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the\nopen-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach\nachieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics\non GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs.
