### [1] [On blow-ups of sets with finite fractional variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03854)
*Giorgio Stefani*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows that for sets with locally finite fractional α-variation, if a non-trivial tangent set with finite integer perimeter exists at almost every point, then a tangent half-space oriented by the fractional unit normal also exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between different geometric properties of sets with fractional variation, specifically relating tangent sets with integer perimeter to tangent half-spaces defined by fractional unit normals.

Method: Using measure theory and geometric analysis techniques to analyze sets with locally finite fractional α-variation and their tangent structures at almost every point with respect to the α-variation measure.

Result: Proves that the existence of non-trivial tangent sets with locally finite integer perimeter implies the existence of tangent half-spaces oriented by the fractional unit normal.

Conclusion: The study establishes a fundamental relationship between different geometric tangent structures for sets with fractional variation, showing that certain tangent conditions naturally imply others.

Abstract: Given $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and a set $E \subset \mathbb R^N$ with locally
finite fractional $\alpha$-variation, we show that for almost every $x \in
\mathbb R^N$ with respect to the $\alpha$-variation measure of $\mathbf 1_E$,
if $E$ admits a non-trivial tangent set at $x$ with locally finite integer
perimeter, then $E$ also admits a tangent half-space oriented by the fractional
unit normal of $E$ at $x$.

### [2] [Robust Subgroup Method Using DE Algorithm for Resonance Self-Shielding Calculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04062)
*Beichen Zheng,Ying Chen,Lili Wen,Xiaofei Wu*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Enhanced subgroup method combining Robust Estimation and Differential Evolution to address systematic absorption bias in resonance self-shielding, particularly for U-238 sensitive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate systematic absorption bias in conventional subgroup fits that depresses reactivity, especially in benchmarks sensitive to U-238, caused by threshold-like conditioning failure and dilution-induced multicollinearity.

Method: Robust subgroup method integrating Robust Estimation (RE) for handling model misspecification and data contamination, with Differential Evolution (DE) as optimization tool within RE framework to obtain constrained solutions.

Result: Numerical validation shows the method removes systematic absorption bias, improves parameter inference to better track underlying physics, and enhances predictive fidelity of transport simulations.

Conclusion: The RE-DE framework successfully addresses adverse conditioning issues in subgroup methods by bounding influence and enforcing feasibility, leading to more faithful physics tracking and improved simulation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the subgroup method for resonance
self-shielding treatment, termed the robust subgroup method, which integrates
Robust Estimation (RE) with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The RE
approach is employed to handle model misspecification and data contamination,
while the DE algorithm serves as an optimization tool within the RE framework
to obtain constrained solutions. Numerical validation against experimental
benchmarks shows that the proposed method removes a systematic absorption bias
in conventional subgroup fits that would otherwise depress reactivity. This
bias appears only in benchmarks sensitive to U-238. Mechanistically, it
reflects a threshold-like conditioning failure: strong self-shielding leverage
dominates the loss and is magnified by dilution-induced multicollinearity. This
adverse conditioning appears to be seeded by a narrow, sparse resonance
structure at low energies in fertile even-even nuclides, thereby causing rapid
self-shielding response saturation and a weak Doppler broadening. By bounding
influence and enforcing feasibility within an RE-DE framework, the inferred
subgroup parameters track the underlying physics more faithfully, improving the
predictive fidelity of subsequent transport simulations.

### [3] [Modeling of Injected Current Stream-Induced 3D Perturbations in Local Helicity Injection Plasmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03930)
*C. E. Schaefer,A. C. Sontag,N. M. Ferraro,J. D. Weberski,S. J. Diem*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Local helicity injection (LHI) for solenoid-free tokamak startup causes magnetic topology degradation in Pegasus-III plasmas, with rotation and two-fluid effects providing partial screening of perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solenoid-free startup techniques like LHI are essential for spherical tokamaks to reduce costs and simplify fusion energy system design, but their effects on magnetic topology need investigation.

Method: Used helical filament model for injected current, calculated linear plasma response with M3D-C1 code, performed Poincaré mapping, and compared single-fluid vs two-fluid models with and without rotation.

Result: LHI causes substantial flux surface degradation starting at Ψ_N ≈ 0.37. Rotation and two-fluid effects partially screen n=1 perturbations, with stronger suppression near the edge in two-fluid cases. Distributed current models better match magnetic probe measurements.

Conclusion: Rotation and two-fluid physics play crucial roles in screening LHI perturbations. Future work should focus on plasma flow measurements and refined stream models for improved predictive capability.

Abstract: Solenoid-free tokamak startup techniques are essential for spherical tokamaks
and offer a pathway to cost reduction and design simplification in fusion
energy systems. Local helicity injection (LHI) is one such approach, employing
compact edge current sources to drive open field line current that initiates
and sustains tokamak plasmas. The recently commissioned Pegasus-III spherical
tokamak provides a platform for advancing this and other solenoid-free startup
methods. This study investigates the effect of LHI on magnetic topology in
Pegasus-III plasmas. A helical filament model represents the injected current,
and the linear plasma response to its 3D field is calculated with M3D-C1.
Poincar\'e mapping reveals substantial flux surface degradation in all modeled
cases. The onset of overlapping magnetic structures and large-scale surface
deformation begins at $\Psi_{N} \approx 0.37$, indicating a broad region of
perturbed topology extending toward the edge. In rotating plasmas, both
single-fluid and two-fluid models exhibit partial screening of the $n = 1$
perturbation, with two-fluid calculations showing stronger suppression near the
edge. In contrast, the absence of rotation leads to strong resonant field
amplification in the single-fluid case, while the two-fluid case with zero
electron rotation mitigates this amplification and preserves edge screening.
Magnetic probe measurements indicate that modeling the stream with spatial
spreading$-$representing distributed current and/or oscillatory motion$-$better
reproduces measured magnetic power profiles than a rigid filament model. The
results underscore the role of rotation and two-fluid physics in screening
stream perturbations and point to plasma flow measurements and refined stream
models as key steps toward improving predictive fidelity.

### [4] [Electromagnetic turbulence in EAST plasmas with internal transport barrier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04044)
*Yuehao Ma,Pengfei Liu,Jian Bao,Zhihong Lin,Huishan Cai*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations show electromagnetic effects suppress ITG turbulence in EAST tokamak ITB regions, reducing thermal ion heat conductivity by at least 4x through enhanced zonal flow shearing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate turbulence in the Internal Transport Barrier (ITB) region of EAST tokamak with weakly reversed magnetic shear, particularly understanding how electromagnetic effects influence ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and transport.

Method: Global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations were conducted, including linear analysis to identify dominant ITG modes and nonlinear simulations to study turbulence suppression mechanisms.

Result: Finite β effects suppress higher frequency ITG modes at q=1 surface; when β_i > 0.5%, the ITG mode near q_min becomes dominant. Nonlinear electromagnetic effects reduce thermal ion heat conductivity by at least 4x through enhanced zonal flow shearing.

Conclusion: Electromagnetic effects are crucial for stabilizing ITG modes and accurately calculating transport coefficients in ITB regions with weak magnetic shear, with energetic particles providing additional slight stabilization.

Abstract: In this study, global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations are
conducted to investigate turbulence in the Internal transport barrier (ITB)
region of the EAST tokamak discharge with weakly reversed magnetic shear.
Linear simulations reveal two dominant ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes: a
higher frequency mode at the $q=1$ surface, which dominates in the
electrostatic limit, and a lower frequency mode near the $q_{\min}$ surface,
which prevails under the experimental $\beta$ (the ratio of plasma pressure to
magnetic pressure). Finite $\beta$ effects effectively suppress higher
frequency ITG modes, and once $\beta_i$ on axis exceeds 0.5\%, this ITG mode is
no longer dominant, and the ITG mode near $q_{\min}$ surface becomes the
primary instability. Therefore, electromagnetic effects play a crucial role in
stabilizing ITG modes, and in causing the transition between the most unstable
mode at different radial positions. The linear growth rate of the unstable mode
in the electrostatic limit is approximately 1.25 times higher than that of the
dominant mode in the electromagnetic case. However, in the electromagnetic
nonlinear regime, the thermal ion heat conductivity is reduced by at least a
factor of 4. This reduction primarily results from nonlinear electromagnetic
effects enhancing the shearing effect of zonal flows, thereby further
suppressing microturbulence. Finally, energetic particles exert a slight
stabilizing effect on ITG turbulence due to dilution and finite $\beta$
contributions. It is emphasized that the electromagnetic effect on ITG with
weak magnetic shear should be included to accurately calculate the transport
coefficients.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cross-scale interactions between electromagnetic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence and fishbone instability in tokamak plasmas, as understanding these multiscale interactions is crucial for enhancing thermal confinement in fusion plasmas.

Method: Performed global gyrokinetic simulations for the first time to study multiscale interactions between electromagnetic ITG turbulence and fishbone instability.

Simulation results agree with experimental observations of turbulence suppression during fishbone bursts.

Conclusion: These findings advance understanding of multiscale interactions that enhance thermal confinement in fusion plasmas, demonstrating fishbone instability can beneficially suppress turbulent transport.

Abstract: Global gyrokinetic simulations are performed for the first time to
investigate cross-scale interactions between electromagnetic ion temperature

reducing ion thermal transport close to the neoclassical level. The simulation
results agree well with experimental observations that turbulence suppression
during fishbone bursts. These findings advance understanding of multiscale

### [6] [Stochastic simulation of partial discharge inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04356)
*Jannis Teunissen,Yuting Gao*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Monte Carlo method for simulating electric discharge inception in gases using electrostatic field data, estimating discharge probability and time lag.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model electric discharge inception in gases by simulating electron avalanches throughout the domain, including regions below critical electric field, to understand discharge formation processes.

Method: Simulate electron avalanches propagating along field lines with photon and ion feedback mechanisms, using statistical distribution for avalanche size valid for gases with strong electron attachment.

Result: Method provides estimated discharge probability per initial electron position and time lag to discharge inception; validated against particle simulations and demonstrated in various electrode geometries.

Conclusion: The Monte Carlo approach effectively models electric discharge inception across different geometries, providing valuable insights into discharge probability and timing.

Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo method for simulating the inception of electric
discharges in gases. The input consists of an unstructured grid containing the
electrostatic field. The output of the model is the estimated probability of
discharge inception per initial electron position, as well as the estimated
time lag between the appearance of the initial electron and discharge
inception. To obtain these quantities electron avalanches are simulated for
initial electron positions throughout the whole domain, also including regions
below the critical electric field. Avalanches are assumed to propagate along
field lines, and they can produce additional avalanches due to photon and ion
feedback. If the number of avalanches keeps increasing over time we assume that
an electric discharge will eventually form. A statistical distribution for the
electron avalanche size is used, which is also valid for gases with strong
electron attachment. We compare this distribution against the results of
particle simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate examples of inception
simulations in 2D Cartesian, 2D axisymmetric and 3D electrode geometries.
