Local helicity injection (LHI) is one such approach, employing\ncompact edge current sources to drive open field line current that initiates\nand sustains tokamak plasmas. The recently commissioned Pegasus-III spherical\ntokamak provides a platform for advancing this and other solenoid-free startup\nmethods. This study investigates the effect of LHI on magnetic topology in\nPegasus-III plasmas. A helical filament model represents the injected current,\nand the linear plasma response to its 3D field is calculated with M3D-C1.\nPoincar\\'e mapping reveals substantial flux surface degradation in all modeled\ncases. The onset of overlapping magnetic structures and large-scale surface\ndeformation begins at $\\Psi_{N} \\approx 0.37$, indicating a broad region of\nperturbed topology extending toward the edge. In rotating plasmas, both\nsingle-fluid and two-fluid models exhibit partial screening of the $n = 1$\nperturbation, with two-fluid calculations showing stronger suppression near the\nedge. In contrast, the absence of rotation leads to strong resonant field\namplification in the single-fluid case, while the two-fluid case with zero\nelectron rotation mitigates this amplification and preserves edge screening.\nMagnetic probe measurements indicate that modeling the stream with spatial\nspreading$-$representing distributed current and/or oscillatory motion$-$better\nreproduces measured magnetic power profiles than a rigid filament model. The\nresults underscore the role of rotation and two-fluid physics in screening\nstream perturbations and point to plasma flow measurements and refined stream\nmodels as key steps toward improving predictive fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Local helicity injection (LHI) for solenoid-free tokamak startup causes magnetic topology degradation in Pegasus-III plasmas, with rotation and two-fluid effects providing partial screening of perturbations.", "motivation": "Solenoid-free startup techniques like LHI are essential for spherical tokamaks to reduce costs and simplify fusion energy system design, but their effects on magnetic topology need investigation.", "method": "Used helical filament model for injected current, calculated linear plasma response with M3D-C1 code, performed Poincar\u00e9 mapping, and compared single-fluid vs two-fluid models with and without rotation.", "result": "LHI causes substantial flux surface degradation starting at \u03a8_N \u2248 0.37.
