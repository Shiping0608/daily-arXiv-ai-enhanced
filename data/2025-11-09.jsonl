In this\nwork, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as\na novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven\ncriticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective\nmeasurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and\ndecoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,\nMDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed\nstates rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay\ngives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical\nsimulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the\ntwo-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a\ndiagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables\nefficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body\nnumerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase\ntransitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians.

Such systems can be\napproximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role\nin the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated\nintegrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a\nuniversal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the\nstate or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In\ncontrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains\nfeasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear\nsystem grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is\ntypically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order\nreduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with\nnon-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially\nlow-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original\nnonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to\nlearn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is\nmodel-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process.\nConsequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data\nfitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems.\nWe illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application\nthrough numerical experiments."}

For\nbands, we extend Gromov's torical inequality and obtain sharp width bounds:\n$\\text{dist}(\\partial_-M,\\partial_+M)\\le 2\\pi\\sqrt{n/((n+1)\\sigma)}$ when\n$R_M\\ge (n-m)(n-m-1)+\\sigma$. The method combines stable weighted slicing with\na spectral Dirac operator argument."}

Our weighted square function estimate is\nderived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are\nformulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight\nparameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we\nobtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators\nand for solutions to free Schrodinger equation."}
