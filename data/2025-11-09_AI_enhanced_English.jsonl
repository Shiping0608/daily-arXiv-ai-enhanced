The present work implements this driving force within a\nfinite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that\nspan diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D\nHoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical\nfracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture\nregimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from\nlarge pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and\ntoughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad\nrange of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and\nrobustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by\narbitrary strength surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper implements a general driving-force expression for phase-field fracture models that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces, enabling both toughness-controlled crack propagation and strength-governed fracture nucleation.", "motivation": "Classical phase-field theories only capture toughness-controlled crack propagation but fail to account for material strength surfaces that govern fracture nucleation in the absence of pre-existing cracks.", "method": "Implementation of a general driving-force expression within a finite-element framework, incorporating representative strength surfaces (Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb) and validating through simulations of canonical fracture problems.", "result": "The formulation successfully captures three fracture regimes: nucleation under uniform stress, crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness.", "conclusion": "The proposed driving-force construction demonstrates generality and robustness for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces, spanning a broad range of brittle materials."}}
