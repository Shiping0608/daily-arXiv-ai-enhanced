It is found\nthat the obliquely incident intense lasers at the target surfaces enable the\nproduced hot electrons to form an azimuthal current and subsequently induce a\nseed magnetic field along the cylindrical axis inside the microtube as the hot\nelectrons transport into it. This current-field configuration is similar to a\ntheta-pinch device.

The\napproach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component\nand the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is\nspecified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the\nnonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical\nsystem structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such\nas stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the\nadvantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and\nadmitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical\nadvantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator\nInference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples\naerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD\n445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online\nprediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and\nsupersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes\nwhile preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference."}

Wheeler"], "title": "Extreme internal waves: gravity currents and overturning fronts", "categories": ["math.AP"], "comment": "42 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Hydrodynamic bores are front-type traveling wave solutions to the two-layer\nfree boundary Euler equations in two dimensions. The velocity field in each\nlayer is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational, and it limits to\ndistinct laminar flows upstream and downstream. Rigid horizontal boundaries\nconfine the fluids from above and below. A constant gravitational force acts on\nthe waves, but surface tension is neglected. It was recently shown by the\nauthors that there exist two large-amplitude families of hydrodynamic bores: a\ncurve of depression bores and a curve of elevation bores. We now prove that in\nthe limit along the elevation bore family, the solutions must overturn: the\ninterface separating the layers develops a vertical tangent. This type of\nbehavior was first observed over 45 years ago in numerical computations of\ninternal gravity waves and gravity water waves with vorticity. Despite\nconsiderable progress over the past decade in constructing families of water\nwaves that potentially overturn, a proof that overturning definitively occurs\nhas been stubbornly elusive. We further show that in the limit along the\ndepression bore family, either overturning occurs or the solutions converge to\na gravity current: the free boundary contacts the upper wall and the relative\nvelocity in the upper fluid is stagnant. We also determine the contact angle\nbetween the interface and the rigid barrier for the limiting gravity current,\ngiving the first rigorous confirmation of a conjecture of von K\\'arm\\'an. The\nresolutions of these questions in the specific case of hydrodynamic bores is\naccomplished through the use of novel geometric analysis techniques, including\nbounds on the decay of the velocity field near a hypothetical double stagnation\npoint.

The presence of\ncorners yields intrinsic analytic obstacles: the lack of smooth tangential\nvectors to the boundary prevents the use of classical anisotropic Sobolev\nspaces, and due to the coupling of normal derivatives near corners, one can not\nfollow the usual way to estimate the normal derivatives of solutions from the\nequations. To overcome these difficulties, a new class of anisotropic Sobolev\nspaces $H^m_*(\\Omega)$ is introduced to treat corner geometries. Within this\nframework, the well-posedness theory is obtained for both linear and nonlinear\nproblems of the compressible ideal MHD equations with the impermeable and\nperfectly conducting boundary conditions. The associated linearized problem is\nstudied in several steps: first one deduces the existence of weak solutions by\nusing a duality argument in high order tangential spaces, then verifies that it\nis indeed a strong solution by several smoothing procedures preserving traces\nto get a weak-strong uniqueness result, afterwards the estimates of normal\nderivatives are obtained by combining the structure of MHD equations with the\nHelmholtz-type decomposition for both of velocity and magnetic fields."}
