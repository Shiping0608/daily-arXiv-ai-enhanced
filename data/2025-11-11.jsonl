Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance. This approach comes with minimal computational overhead and requires no internal changes to the GP implementation, as it can be seen as a separate preprocessing step. We illustrate the achieved benefits using multiple examples."}

These methods are compared in terms of their stability and computational efficiency. Our numerical analysis and computational results demonstrate that all three discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes are stable.

A comparison between the Incomplete Interior Penalty Galerkin (IIPG) and Nonsymmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (NIPG) schemes shows that IIPG has superior stability properties. For high values of the penalty parameter, all methods exhibit similar stability behavior.

In the central hotspot ignition scheme, the hotspot must self-heat and propagate thermonuclear burn before disassembly. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations with a Monte Carlo alpha particle transport model, we investigate the effect of alpha momentum deposition across sub-ignition to robustly igniting regimes by hydrodynamic scaling of current central hotspot ignition designs from the National Ignition Facility (NIF). We find that the effective alpha particle ram pressure accelerates the shell at burn, reducing hotspot compression, increasing the rate of disassembly and decreasing yield. This causes a notable (~ 30%) reduction in yield at current NIF scale, with a persistent (~ 10%) penalty at larger hydrodynamic scales. These results demonstrate that alpha momentum deposition is a significant effect for present ignition-scale implosions, necessitating its inclusion in ignition criteria, burn models, and designs for high-gain inertial confinement fusion."}

Building upon conventional six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) formulations for chaff aerodynamic analysis-which assumed straight or two-dimensionally bent geometries-we extend the framework to incorporate arbitrarily curved three-dimensional chaff geometries. This extension enables accurate modeling of both flattened and helical dynamics induced by aerodynamic moments acting along the roll, pitch, and yaw directions, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic description of chaff motion. We then finally develop a coupled aerodynamic-electromagnetic framework that integrates the extended aerodynamic model with our recently developed fast method-of-moments solver, which is optimized for efficiently estimating the RCS of million-scale chaff clouds. The proposed multiphysics coupled framework allows real-time, first-principles prediction of the monostatic and bistatic RCS of large-scale chaff clouds with arbitrary geometries, orientations, and lengths, accurately incorporating their time-varying aerodynamic evolution. Simulation results confirm that the monostatic RCS is strongly influenced by aerodynamic effects, with the coexistence of flattened and helical motions playing a critical role in determining the overall scattering response. The proposed framework thus provides a physically grounded and computationally efficient approach for predicting the RCS of large-scale chaff clouds. Furthermore, it can be directly extended to radar signal processing applications by utilizing multi-frequency complex-valued far-field responses, thereby enabling the reconstruction of Range-Doppler, Range-Angle, and Doppler-Angle maps."}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Extended Deep Energy Method (XDEM), a unified deep learning framework that incorporates both displacement discontinuities and crack-tip asymptotics in the discrete setting, while flexibly coupling displacement and phase fields in the continuous setting. This integration enables accurate fracture predictions using uniformly distributed, relatively sparse collocation points. Validation across benchmark problems including stress intensity factor evaluation, straight and kinked crack growth, and complex crack initiation demonstrates that XDEM consistently outperforms standard DEM in accuracy and efficiency.

This makes them particularly well-suited for deployment on neuromorphic hardware and for scenarios with constrained computational resources, such as embedded and edge devices. A central challenge, however, lies in reconciling the discontinuous dynamics of spiking neurons with the smooth residual-based loss formulation required in PINNs. Direct smoothing introduces systematic biases, leading to inaccurate PDE learning. To overcome this, we employ a novel stochastic projection method inspired from upscaled theory that faithfully captures spiking behavior while maintaining compatibility with gradient-based optimization. Standard surrogate backpropagation is used for parameter updates, ensuring computational tractability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroPINNs on four representative PDE problems across both regular and irregular domains.

This pressure, known as the initial pressure distribution, relaxes as broadband ultrasound waves that are measured on the boundary of the target. In the inverse problem of TAT, the initial pressure is estimated from the measured ultrasound waves. TAT can further be extended to quantitative TAT (QTAT), where the aim is to estimate the dielectric parameters of the imaged target by utilizing a model for electromagnetic wave propagation.

The analysis reveals a characteristic double-well potential unique to RMS profiles, which gives rise to the degeneracy between the lowest-order even and first-order odd eigenmodes when the two potential wells are sufficiently separated radially.

J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)]."}

One way to address this is exit wave reconstruction, i.e., the recovery of the complex-valued electron wave at the specimen's exit plane from intensity-only measurements. This is an inverse problem with a nonlinear forward model. We consider a simplified forward model, making the problem equivalent to phase retrieval, and propose a discretized regularized variational formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the proximal gradient algorithm (PGA) and unfold its iterations into a neural network, where each layer corresponds to one PGA step with learnable parameters. This unrolling approach, inspired by LISTA, enables improved reconstruction quality, interpretability, and implicit dictionary learning from data. We analyze the effect of parameter perturbations and show that they can accumulate exponentially with the number of layers $L$. Building on proof techniques of Behboodi et al., originally developed for LISTA, i.e., for a linear forward model, we extend the analysis to our nonlinear setting and establish generalization error bounds of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{L})$. Numerical experiments support the exponential growth of parameter perturbations."}

We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models. This demonstrates that Walsh-Hadamard and Fourier representations capture complementary aspects of discontinuous PDE solutions, with WHNO excelling at sharp interfaces while FNO captures smooth features effectively."}

Additionally, the consistency requirement for phase-field modeling brings difficulties to the construction of nonlinear potentials in the energy functionals, posing significant challenges for classical phase-field modeling and its numerical methods for problems involving many phases. In this work, by adopting a dichotomic approach to represent multiphase, we propose a novel phase-field modeling framework without simplex constraint,in which the free energy is interpolated from the classical two-phase Ginzburg-Landau free energies. We systematically establish the interpolation rules and explicitly construct the interpolation functions, rendering the consistency properties of the model. The proposed model enjoys an energy dissipation property and is shown to be asymptotically consistent with its sharp interface limit, with the Neumann triangle condition recovered at the triple junction.Based on a mobility operator splitting technique, we develop a linear, decoupled, and energy stable scheme for efficiently solving the system of phase-field equations. The numerical stability and accuracy, as well as the consistency properties of the model, are validated through a large number of numerical examples. In particular, the model demonstrates its success in several benchmark simulations for multiphase problems, such as the formation of liquid lenses between two stratified fluids, the generation of double emulsions and Janus emulsions, showing good agreement with experimental observations."}

Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions."}

The surface tension is neglected and the water motion is rotational with a constant vorticity $a$. We consider an analytic branch of Stokes waves started from a subcritical laminar flow, where the period is considered as the bifurcation parameter. The first eigenvalue of the Fréchet derivative on this branch is always negative. The main object of our study is the second eigenvalue of the Fréchet derivative at this branch in a neighborhood of the laminar flow. This is a small eigenvalue and the positive sign corresponds to the confirmation of the principle of exchange of stability and the negative sign to its violation. We consider the dependence of the sign on the Bernoulli constant $R$ (or the depth $d$ of the laminar flow) and the value of the constant vorticity $a$. We show that for each $a$ there exist a depth $d_0(a)$ such that the sign of the second eigenvalue is positive for $d<d_0(a)$ and negative for $d>d_0(a)$. If $d_s(a)$ is the depth where a stagnation point appears on the corresponding laminar flow then $d_0(a)<d_s(a)$ for positive $a$ and $d_0(a)>d_s(a)$ for negative $a<-1.01803$. The sign of the second eigenvalue is important in study of subharmonic bifurcations. Another observed property consists of the following: if the sign of the second eigenvalue is positive then the period is increasing along the bifurcation curve in a neighborhood of the bifurcation point, if the sign is negative then the period is decreasing there. We also verify the property of formal stability by a description of the domain in $(a,d)$ variables, where this property holds. Numerical illustrations of these properties are presented in the paper."}

In this study, we propose a method based on the glass approach that can generate two-component particle loads with more general $N_{\\rm DM}:N_{\\rm gas}$ ratios. The method simultaneously relaxes two Poisson particle distributions by introducing an additional repulsive force between particles of the same component. We show that the final particle load closely follows the expected minimal power spectrum, $P(k) \\propto k^{4}$, exhibits good homogeneity and isotropy properties, and remains sufficiently stable under gravitational interactions. Both the dark matter and gas components individually also exhibit uniform and isotropic distributions. We apply our method to two-component cosmological simulations and demonstrate that an equal-mass particle setup effectively mitigates the spurious collisional heating that arises in unequal-mass simulations. Our method can be extended to generate multi-component uniform and isotropic distributions. Our code based on Gadget-2 is available at https://github.com/liaoshong/gadget-2glass ."}

The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice."}

NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets."}

When the polynomial is of degree $d$ and all power series are truncated after $n^{th}$ power, we formally arrive into a Hermite interpolation polynomial of degree $d(n+1)-1$. The natural way to represent Hermite interpolation is to have for each interpolation condition a basis polynomial which in this case leads to $d(n+1)$ basis polynomials. We then consider the numerical accumulation of errors in the different ways to represent and evaluate the Hermite interpolation. In the multicentric representation due to the convergence of the power series, numerical errors stay bounded as $n$ grows.

These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected.\n  In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes.

In the low-dimensional examples the particle filters work well, but when we scale up to a partially observed 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model the particle-based methods fail and the logarithmic deep density method prevails. In terms of computational efficiency, the deep density methods reduce inference time by roughly two to five orders of magnitude relative to the particle-based filters."}

Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline.

Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization.

We show that some strictly increasing hyperpriors, such as half-Laplace and half-generalized Gaussian with the power in $(0,1)$, effectively promote sparsity and improve solution stability with respect to measurement noise.

We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution.

We focus on the small-Biot-number regime. The problem is accurately described by the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) formulation, which couples the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid with the heat equation in the solid through interfacial continuity conditions. Because full CHT simulations are computationally expensive, simplified models are often used in practice. Starting from the coupled equations, we systematically reduce the formulation to the lumped-capacitance model, a single ordinary differential equation with a closed-form solution, based on two assumptions: time scale separation and a spatially uniform solid temperature. The total modeling error is decomposed into time homogenization and lumping contributions. We derive an asymptotic error bound for the lumping error, valid for general heterogeneous solids and spatially varying heat transfer coefficients. Building on this theoretical result, we introduce a computable upper bound expressed in measurable quantities for practical evaluation. Time scale separation is analyzed theoretically and supported by physical arguments and simulations, showing that large separation yields small time homogenization errors. In practice, the Biot number must be estimated from so-called empirical correlations, which are typically limited to specific canonical geometries.

In the first case, the structure of the source term ensures that the total cell mass remains controlled over time.

The effectiveness of such approach is proven by reproducing biologically relevant results like the formation of propagating invasion fronts and the emergence of an interstitial gap between normal and cancerous cells, which is driven by the pH lowering strategy and depends significantly on the non-homogenous diffusion rates.

Despite their empirical success, the mathematical foundations of those models remain only partially understood, particularly regarding the stability and consistency of the underlying stochastic and partial differential equations governing their dynamics.\n  In this work, we develop a rigorous partial differential equation (PDE) framework for score-based diffusion processes. Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity. Our findings also provide practical insights for designing diffusion models, including principled criteria for score-function construction, loss formulation, and stopping-time selection. Altogether, this framework provides a quantitative understanding of the trade-off between generative capacity and imitation fidelity, bridging rigorous analysis and model design within a unified mathematical perspective."}
