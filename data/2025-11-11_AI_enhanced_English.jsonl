Often, the dependence of the solution of the ODE on additional parameters is of interest, e.g.\\ when dealing with uncertainty quantification or design optimization. Directly studying this dependence can quickly become too computationally expensive, such that cheaper surrogate models approximating the solution are of interest. One popular class of surrogate models are Gaussian processes (GPs). They perform well when approximating stationary functions, functions which have a similar level of variation along any given parameter direction, however solutions to stiff ODEs are often characterized by a mixture of regions of rapid and slow variation along the time axis and when dealing with such nonstationary functions, GP performance frequently degrades drastically. We therefore aim to reparameterize stiff ODE solutions based on the available data, to make them appear more stationary and hence recover good GP performance.

This extension enables accurate modeling of both flattened and helical dynamics induced by aerodynamic moments acting along the roll, pitch, and yaw directions, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic description of chaff motion.

This makes them particularly well-suited for deployment on neuromorphic hardware and for scenarios with constrained computational resources, such as embedded and edge devices. A central challenge, however, lies in reconciling the discontinuous dynamics of spiking neurons with the smooth residual-based loss formulation required in PINNs. Direct smoothing introduces systematic biases, leading to inaccurate PDE learning. To overcome this, we employ a novel stochastic projection method inspired from upscaled theory that faithfully captures spiking behavior while maintaining compatibility with gradient-based optimization.

Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods.

We focus on the small-Biot-number regime. The problem is accurately described by the conjugate heat transfer (CHT) formulation, which couples the Navier-Stokes and energy equations in the fluid with the heat equation in the solid through interfacial continuity conditions. Because full CHT simulations are computationally expensive, simplified models are often used in practice. Starting from the coupled equations, we systematically reduce the formulation to the lumped-capacitance model, a single ordinary differential equation with a closed-form solution, based on two assumptions: time scale separation and a spatially uniform solid temperature. The total modeling error is decomposed into time homogenization and lumping contributions. We derive an asymptotic error bound for the lumping error, valid for general heterogeneous solids and spatially varying heat transfer coefficients. Building on this theoretical result, we introduce a computable upper bound expressed in measurable quantities for practical evaluation. Time scale separation is analyzed theoretically and supported by physical arguments and simulations, showing that large separation yields small time homogenization errors. In practice, the Biot number must be estimated from so-called empirical correlations, which are typically limited to specific canonical geometries.

Building on the Li--Yau differential inequality for the heat flow, we prove well-posedness and derive sharp $L^p$-stability estimates for the associated score-based Fokker--Planck dynamics, providing a mathematically consistent description of their temporal evolution. Through entropy stability methods, we further show that the reverse-time dynamics of diffusion models concentrate on the data manifold for compactly supported data distributions and a broad class of initialization schemes, with a concentration rate of order $\\sqrt{t}$ as $t \\to 0$.\n  These results yield a theoretical guarantee that, under exact score guidance, diffusion trajectories return to the data manifold while preserving imitation fidelity.
