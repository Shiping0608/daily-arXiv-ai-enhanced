The method combines neural networks with reduced-order modeling and physics-informed training to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. In the offline stage, reduced basis functions are obtained via nonlinear dimension reduction, and a neural surrogate is trained to map parameters to approximate solutions. The surrogate employs a nonlinear reconstruction of the solution from the basis functions, enabling more accurate representation of complex solution structures than linear mappings. The model is further refined during the online stage using lightweight physics-informed neural network training. This offline-online framework enables accurate prediction especially in complex scenarios or with limited snapshot data. We demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments."}

Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these bounds. The lambda maximal bound consistently ensures that all the roots lie within the complex circle, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Comparative results demonstrate that while New bound 1 guarantees convergence, but it yields excessively large radii."}

Transferring such equilibria from the GS discretization to the MHD discretization often introduces errors that lead to unwanted perturbations to the equilibria on the level of the MHD discretization. In this work, we identify and analyze sources of such errors in the context of finite element methods, with a focus on the force balance and divergence-free properties of the loaded equilibria. In particular, we reveal three main sources of errors: (1) the improper choice of finite element spaces in the MHD scheme relative to the poloidal flux and toroidal field function spaces in the GS scheme, (2) the misalignment of the meshes from two solvers, and (3) possibly under-resolved strong gradients near the separatrix. With this in mind, we study the impact of different choices of finite element spaces, including those based on compatible finite elements. In addition, we also investigate the impact of mesh misalignment and propose to conduct mesh refinement to resolve the strong gradients near the separatrix. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate equilibria errors arising in the transferred initial conditions. Results show that force balance is best preserved when structure-preserving finite element spaces are used and when the MHD and GS meshes are both aligned and refined. Given that the poloidal flux is often computed in continuous Galerkin spaces, we further demonstrate that projecting the magnetic field into divergence-conforming spaces is optimal for preserving force balance, while projection into curl-conforming spaces, although less optimal for force balance, weakly preserves the divergence-free property."}

A staggered-grid arrangement, in which solution points are stored at cell centers instead of at the vertices, is presented to address the boundary conservation issues encountered in previous studies. The key ingredient in the AMR framework, i.e., the high-order nonlinear interpolation method applied in the prolongation step together with the determination of fine-grid boundary conditions, are re-derived for staggered grids following the procedures in prior work [1] and are thus used here. Meanwhile, a high-order restriction method is developed in the present study as the coarse and fine grid solutions are non-collocated in this configuration. To avoid non-conservative interpolation at discontinuous cells that could incur instabilities, a hybrid interpolation strategy is proposed in this work for the first time, where the non-conservative WENO interpolation is applied in smooth regions whereas the second-order conservative interpolation is applied at shocks. This significantly mitigates the numerical instabilities introduced by non-conservative interpolation and pointwise replacement. The two interpolation approaches are seamlessly coupled through a troubled-cell detector achieved by a scale-irrelevant Riemann solver in a robust way. The present work is developed on a publicly available block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework AMReX [2]. The canonical tests demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of accurately resolving a wide range of complex shock-turbulence interaction problems that have been proven intricate for existing approaches"}

The simplicity of our model allows us to succinctly illustrate various phenomena of geometric and analytic significance tied to shocks, which we view as a prototype for phenomena that can occur in more general quasilinear hyperbolic PDE solutions.\n  Our Cauchy problem admits a classical solution that blows up in finite time. The classical solution is defined in a largest possible globally hyperbolic region called a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD), and its properties are tied to the intrinsic Lorentzian geometry of the equation and solution. The boundary of the MGHD contains an initial singularity, a singular boundary along which the solution's second derivatives blow up (the solution and its first derivatives remain bounded), and a Cauchy horizon. Our main results provide the first example of a provably unique MGHD for a shock-forming quasilinear wave equation solution; it is provably unique because its boundary has a favorable global structure that we precisely describe.\n  We also prove that for the same $C^{\\infty}$ initial data, the Cauchy problem admits a second kind of solution: a unique global weak entropy solution that has a shock curve separating two smooth regions. Of particular interest is our proof that the classical and weak solutions agree before the shock but differ in a region to the future of the first singularity where both solutions are defined."}

An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.\n  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.\n  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest.

In fact, when finite plasma resistivity is taken into account, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, it is only necessary to include rational surfaces that lie in the region 0<Psi<Psi_c, where Psi is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux, and Psi_c<1 can be calculated from the edge plasma parameters.

Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales."}

The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%.

Under the assumptions of sufficiently small shock strength and initial perturbations, we prove that planar viscous shock waves are nonlinearly stable. The main steps of our analysis are as follows. First, using the relative entropy method together with the framework of $a$-contraction with shifts, we derive energy estimates for the weighted relative entropy of perturbations. We then successively obtain high-order and dissipation estimates via direct energy arguments, which provide the required a priori bounds. Combining these estimates with a local existence result, we establish the global asymptotic stability of the shifted planar viscous shock wave. Finally, we show that as the relaxation parameter tends to zero, solutions of the relaxed system converge globally in time to those of the classical Navier-Stokes system."}

Our approach is based on local histopolation methods defined through unisolvent triples, where the edge weights are induced by probability densities. We present a general strategy that applies to arbitrary polynomial order~$k$, in which edge moments are taken against orthogonal polynomials associated with the chosen densities. This yields a systematic framework for weighted reconstructions of any degree, with theoretical guarantees of unisolvency and fully explicit basis functions. As a concrete and flexible instance, we introduce a two-parameter family of Jacobi-type distributions on $[-1,1]$, together with its symmetric Gegenbauer subclass, and show how these densities generate new quadratic reconstruction operators that generalize the standard linear histopolation scheme while preserving its simplicity and locality. We employ an adaptive parameter selection algorithm for Jacobi densities, which automatically tunes the distribution parameters to minimize the global reconstruction error. This strategy enhances robustness and adaptivity across different function classes and mesh resolutions. The effectiveness of the proposed operators is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, which confirm their superior accuracy in approximating both smooth and highly oscillatory functions. Finally, the framework is sufficiently general to accommodate any admissible edge density, thus providing a flexible and broadly applicable tool for weighted function reconstruction."}

This advancement enables simulations on complex geometries where purely hexahedral meshes are difficult or impossible to generate. However, the use of meshes with heterogeneous element types introduces a workload imbalance, a consequence of the temporal evolution of modal rather than nodal degrees of freedom and the accompanying transformations.

The method employs high-precision runtime measurements and efficient data redistribution to dynamically reassign mesh elements along a space-filling curve. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and large-scale parallel runs on the EuroHPC pre-exascale system MareNostrum 5. Results show that the proposed strategy recovers a significant fraction of the lost efficiency on heterogeneous meshes while retaining excellent strong and weak scaling."}

To evaluate and optimize IT drug delivery, it is necessary to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). In combination with experimental measurements, computational modeling plays an important role in reconstructing CSF flow in the CNS. Existing models have provided valuable insights into the CSF dynamics; however, most neglect the effects of tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on measured CSF flow rates under specific conditions, leaving full-CNS CSF flow field predictions across different physiological states underexplored. Here, we propose a comprehensive multiphysics computational model of the CNS with three key features: (1) it is implemented on a fully closed geometry of CNS; (2) it includes the interaction between CSF and poroelastic tissue as well as the compliant spinal dura mater; (3) it has potential for predictive simulations because it only needs data on cardiac blood pulsation into the brain. Our simulations under physiological conditions demonstrate that our model accurately reconstructs the CSF pulsation and captures both the craniocaudal attenuation and phase shift of CSF flow along the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). When applied to the simulation of IT drug delivery, our model successfully captures the intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation during injection and subsequent recovery after injections.

Our method integrates a primary fine-time-step discretization of the SDE with a control variate derived from a secondary coarse-time-step discretization driven by a piecewise parabolic approximation of Brownian motion. This approximation is conditioned on the same fine-scale Brownian increments, enabling strong coupling between the estimators. The expectation of the control variate is computed via an independent MC simulation using the coarse approximation. We characterize the minimized quadratic error decay as a function of the computational budget and the weak and strong orders of the primary and secondary discretization schemes. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments on representative SDEs."}

For translation-invariant initial states with controlled boson density, we improve the known bound on the local repulsive energy at time $t$ from $\\langle n^2_x\\rangle_t\\lesssim t^{2d}$ to $\\langle n^2_x\\rangle_t\\lesssim t^d$. This shows that bosonic on-site energies accumulate at most ballistically. Extending the result to higher moments would have powerful implications for bosonic Lieb-Robinson bounds. While previous approaches focused on controlling particle transport, our proof develops novel ASTLOs (adiabatic space-time localization observables) that are able to track the growth of local boson-boson correlations."}

Computation reduces to a single $p\\times p$ outer matrix product and one subtraction. Empirical benchmarks in Python show clear runtime gains over numpy.cov in non-BLAS-tuned settings.

These algorithms address the problem of solving a system of linear equations $\\boldsymbol{Ax}=\\boldsymbol{b}$ arising from the discretization of either an elliptic PDE or of an associated integral equation. The matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ will be sparse when the PDE is discretized directly, and dense when an integral equation formulation is used. In either case, industry practice for large scale problems has for decades been to use iterative solvers such as multigrid, GMRES, or conjugate gradients. A direct solver, in contrast, builds an approximation to the inverse of $\\boldsymbol{A}$, or alternatively, an easily invertible factorization (e.g. LU or Cholesky). A major development in numerical analysis in the last couple of decades has been the emergence of algorithms for constructing such factorizations or performing such inversions in linear or close to linear time. Such methods must necessarily exploit that the matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}$ is \"data-sparse\", typically in the sense that it can be tessellated into blocks that have low numerical rank. This survey provides a unifying context to both sparse and dense fast direct solvers, introduces key concepts with a minimum of notational overhead, and provides guidance to help a user determine the best method to use for a given application."}

The main idea is to use an arborification map on decorated trees together with a Butcher-Connes-Kreimer type coproduct and lower-dominant parts decompositions of the Fourier operator coming from the nonlinear interactions. This new family of low regularity schemes has explicit formulae for its coefficients and its local error. Under a mild assumption, one could expect these schemes to have a similar local error as the low regularity schemes proposed in arXiv:2005.01649."}

The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schrödinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator."}

For a general closed planar curve, our computational method resolves both the interior and exterior Green's functions with the source placed either in the bulk or on the surface -- yielding four distinct functions. Our method exactly represents the singular nature of the Green's function by decomposing the singular and regular components. In the case of the interior function, we exactly prescribe an integral constraint which is necessary to obtain a unique solution given the arbitrary constant solution associated with Neumann boundary conditions. Our implementation is based on a fast integral method for the regular part of the Green's function which allows for a rapid and high order discretization for general domains. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method for simple geometries such as disks and ellipses where closed form solutions are available. To exhibit the usefulness of these new routines, we demonstrate several applications to open problems in the capture of Brownian particles, specifically, how the small traps or boundary windows should be configured to maximize the capture rate of Brownian particles."}
