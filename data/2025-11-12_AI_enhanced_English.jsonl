In this work, we identify and analyze sources of such errors in the context of finite element methods, with a focus on the force balance and divergence-free properties of the loaded equilibria. In particular, we reveal three main sources of errors: (1) the improper choice of finite element spaces in the MHD scheme relative to the poloidal flux and toroidal field function spaces in the GS scheme, (2) the misalignment of the meshes from two solvers, and (3) possibly under-resolved strong gradients near the separatrix. With this in mind, we study the impact of different choices of finite element spaces, including those based on compatible finite elements. In addition, we also investigate the impact of mesh misalignment and propose to conduct mesh refinement to resolve the strong gradients near the separatrix. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate equilibria errors arising in the transferred initial conditions. Results show that force balance is best preserved when structure-preserving finite element spaces are used and when the MHD and GS meshes are both aligned and refined.

This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value.

To evaluate and optimize IT drug delivery, it is necessary to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). In combination with experimental measurements, computational modeling plays an important role in reconstructing CSF flow in the CNS. Existing models have provided valuable insights into the CSF dynamics; however, most neglect the effects of tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on measured CSF flow rates under specific conditions, leaving full-CNS CSF flow field predictions across different physiological states underexplored. Here, we propose a comprehensive multiphysics computational model of the CNS with three key features: (1) it is implemented on a fully closed geometry of CNS; (2) it includes the interaction between CSF and poroelastic tissue as well as the compliant spinal dura mater; (3) it has potential for predictive simulations because it only needs data on cardiac blood pulsation into the brain. Our simulations under physiological conditions demonstrate that our model accurately reconstructs the CSF pulsation and captures both the craniocaudal attenuation and phase shift of CSF flow along the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). When applied to the simulation of IT drug delivery, our model successfully captures the intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation during injection and subsequent recovery after injections. The proposed multiphysics model provides a unified and extensible framework that allows parametric studies of CSF flow dynamics and optimization of IT injections, serving as a strong foundation for integration of additional physiological mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "A comprehensive multiphysics computational model of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the central nervous system that includes tissue mechanics and can predict CSF flow across different physiological states using only cardiac blood pulsation data.", "motivation": "Existing CSF dynamics models neglect tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on specific measured flow rates, leaving full-CNS CSF flow predictions underexplored.

We improve upon the method for the construction of semi-analytical solutions for the oil displacement by a water slug containing dissolved chemicals given in (Pires, Bedrikovetsky and Shapiro, 2006) and later generalized in (Apolin\u00e1rio, de Paula and Pires, 2020), (Apolin\u00e1rio and Pires, 2021). This method utilizes a transformation into the Lagrange coordinates that splits the equations and allows one to solve the chromatographic one-phase problem separately. The solution is then substituted into a scalar hyperbolic conservation law, which is solved using the method of characteristics. However, there is often a gap in the characteristics near the chemical shock front. It was posited to the authors that the Jouguet principle could be used to close that gap. However, no rigorous justification was given for this approach, and as such it remained a heuristic. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of the gap and its properties, and give a proper argumentation for the Jouguet heuristic and its applicability based on the Kru\u017ekov-type uniqueness theorem for the conservation law system. Additionally, a second splitting technique within the Lagrange coordinates is developed that simplifies this analysis and the construction of characteristics.\n  Keywords: Enhanced oil recovery, Polymer flooding, Slug injection, Conservation laws, Hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations", "AI": {"tldr": "Improved semi-analytical method for polymer flooding in enhanced oil recovery using Lagrange coordinates and characteristic methods, with rigorous justification for Jouguet principle to close characteristic gaps.", "motivation": "To address gaps in characteristics near chemical shock fronts in existing polymer flood models and provide rigorous mathematical justification for the Jouguet heuristic approach.", "method": "Uses transformation into Lagrange coordinates to split equations, solves chromatographic one-phase problem separately, then applies method of characteristics to hyperbolic conservation law.
