This method is inspired by non-stationary Particle methods, the time variable being replaced by one spatial variable. Particles trajectories are computed using the ``time-dependent'' equations, and then the approximation is based on a quadrature method using the particle locations as quadrature points. We prove the convergence of the scheme under suitable regularity assumptions on the data and the solution, together with a ``characteristic completeness'' assumption (the characteristic curves fullfill the whole computational domain). We also provide an error estimate. The scheme is tested numerically on a two dimensional linear equation and we present a numerical study of convergence. Finally, we use this method to carry out numerical simulations of a landscape evolution model, where an erodible topography evolves under the effects of water erosion and sedimentation. The scheme is then useful to deal with wet/dry areas."}

For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p σ_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$. Therefore, it is natural and important to estimate the error $ \\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. In this paper, we develop a new method (based on contour analysis) to bound $\\| \\tilde A_p - A_p \\|$. We introduce new parameters that measure the skewness between the noise matrix $E$ and the singular vectors of $A$, and exploit these to obtain notable improvements in many popular settings. This method is of independent interest and has many further applications. We focus on the case where $A$ itself has relatively low rank. This assumption is frequently met in practice, and we think that this case deserves a separate, accessible treatment."}

The approach incorporates a judgment condition to ensure the problem's well-posedness and computes a lower-degree Newton-type interpolation basis (which is also a strongly proper interpolation basis) along with the corresponding interpolation polynomial.

A non-neutral plasma of one species (e.g. antiprotons) can be collisionally cooled on another colder species (e.g. electrons). Modeling temperature relaxation in these devices is challenging from a plasma physics perspective because the particles are strongly magnetized (the gyrofrequency exceeds the plasma frequency). Recently, a theoretical model was proposed to describe the temperature evolution in these conditions, predicting a multistep relaxation process where temperatures parallel to the magnetic field relax much faster than perpendicular to it. Here, this model is tested using molecular dynamics simulations. Two analysis methods are applied: one based on an imposed temperature difference, and the other based on a Green-Kubo relation. The results of the simulations support the theoretical predictions. This work extends previous studies of temperature anisotropy relaxation in one-component non-neutral plasmas to the two-component systems relevant to trapped antimatter experiments."}

It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density.

This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal evolution of wake structures and assess their role in the generation of THz radiation. A Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulation framework, optimized for cylindrical geometries, has been employed to model the relativistic dynamics of plasma electrons under the combined influence of laser-induced ponderomotive forces and an external magnetic field. It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density. Distinct THz peaks have been identified in the Fourier-transformed spectra, with their amplitudes enhanced by resonant coupling between wake-field harmonics and the laser frequency modulation. Moreover, electron motion has been confined by the magnetic field, leading to improved energy gain and shaping of angular radiation patterns. These findings suggest that tailored laser and plasma configurations can be used to optimize energy transfer mechanisms, paving the way for more efficient wake-field usage and THz generation."}

To propagate these uncertainties and convey their influence on the performance of the engineering system, a high-dimensional design space is supposed to be explored. A great challenge to be considered here lies in the computational burden as conducting such an exploration campaign requires substantial calls to computationally expensive finite element simulations. To address this challenge, a surrogate model mapping the design space to the reinforced concrete bridge performance functions is developed in the context of an active learning algorithm. The importance of this model lies in its ability to explore as many design scenarios as possible with minimal computational resources and classify the design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios. This work considers a 4-span reinforced concrete bridge deck. A multi-fiber finite element model of this beam is developed in Cast3m to generate the required design of experiments for the surrogate model. A performance comparison is undertaken to evaluate the Kriging surrogate model effectiveness with and without active learning while the reliability of Kriging predictions is also assessed in comparison to PC-Kriging."}

The results reveal systematic amplification and reshaping of wakefields under the combined action of external magnetic fields and RF drivers. Variations in the cyclotron to plasma frequency ratio dictate the radial positioning and gyromotion of plasma electrons, sharpening transverse confinement and stabilizing blowout structures. The RF amplitude introduces progressive modulation of radial excursions and transverse forces, enhancing wakefield symmetry and depth. Current density distributions confirm the nonlinear scaling with RF strength, evolving from weak perturbations into sharply structured ion channels.

However, due to considerably enhanced heat flux, the exhaust problems become severe. In addition, in the low-recycling regime, the conventional fluid simulations may not capture the physics of the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) plasma that lies in the long mean free path regime; kinetic calculations become necessary. In this paper, by performing both Kinetic and fluid simulations, we explore the feasibility of a low-recycling regime in the magnetic geometry of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP); kinetic effects come out to be crucial determinants of the SOL dynamics. The simulation results indicate that a high SOL temperature and low SOL density could be achieved even when the divertor target is not made of a low recycling material. This can be done by using a low recycling material as a wall material. This is an important step towards demonstrating the feasibility of a low-recycling scenario. Lithium, a commonly used low recycling material, tends to evaporate at high heat fluxes which counteracts the desired high temperature, low density regime, and materials that can handle high heat fluxes are generally high recycling. Comparisons of gyrokinetic and fluid simulation results indicate that one can take advantage of kinetic effects to address some of the issues associated with a low-recycling SOL. Specifically, kinetic simulations show better confinement of impurities to the divertor region and greater broadening of the heat flux width due to drifts when compared with fluid simulations. Impurity confinement would help prevent core contamination from sputtering, and a broader heat flux width would help reduce the peak heat load at the target in the absence of detachment."}

Typically, these interactions are modeled by bounce-averaging the quasilinear Kennel-Engelmann diffusion tensor over the particle orbit. However, as an object derived in a two-dimensional space, the Kennel-Engelmann tensor does not fully respect the conservation of four-momentum required by the action conservation theorem, since it neglects the absorption of perpendicular momentum. This defect leads to incorrect predictions for the wave-induced cross-field particle transport. Here, we show how this defect can easily be fixed, by extending the tensor from two to four dimensions and matching the form required by four-momentum conservation. The resulting extended tensor, when bounce-averaged, recovers the form of the diffusion paths required by action-angle Hamiltonian theory. Importantly, the extended tensor should be easily implementable in Fokker-Planck codes through a mild modification of the existing Kennel-Engelmann tensor."}

While first-order total variation (TV) regularization effectively preserves edges, it often introduces staircase artifacts, whereas higher-order TV removes such artifacts but oversmooths fine details. To reconcile these competing effects, we propose a semi-convergent stage-wise framework that sequentially integrates first- and higher-order TV regularizers within an iterative restoration process implemented via ADMM. Each stage exhibits semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iterates initially approach the ground truth before being degraded by over-regularization. By monitoring this evolution, the algorithm adaptively selects the locally optimal iterate (e.g., with the highest PSNR) and propagates it as the initial point for the next stage. This select-and-propagate mechanism effectively transfers local semi-convergence into a globally convergent iterative process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the sequence of stage-wise iterates is bounded, the objective values decrease monotonically. Extensive numerical experiments on denoising and deblurring benchmarks confirm that the proposed method achieves superior quantitative and perceptual performance compared with conventional first-, higher-order, hybrid TV methods, and learning based methods, while maintaining theoretical interpretability and algorithmic simplicity."}

Rev. X 11, 041005) have proposed that statistically isotropic decaying MHD turbulence without net magnetic helicity conserves the mean square fluctuation level of magnetic helicity in large volumes -- or, equivalently, the integral over space of the two-point correlation function of the magnetic-helicity density, denoted $I_H$. Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor & Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation."}

We succeed in relaxing these conditions by providing the precise asymptotic form of a singular solution. Our second result concerns the bifurcation diagram of regular solutions. While the bifurcation structure has been extensively studied in three or higher dimensions, comparatively little was known in two dimensions until recently. In [18], the second author proved that the bifurcation curve possesses infinitely many turning points for supercritical analytic nonlinearities. In the present work, we refine this analysis by showing the bifurcation curve oscillates infinitely many times around some point, without assuming analyticity of the nonlinearities.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations."}

Discovery Requires Chaos", "categories": ["math.DS", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "math.NA", "nlin.CD"], "comment": "20 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The deep learning revolution has spurred a rise in advances of using AI in sciences. Within physical sciences the main focus has been on discovery of dynamical systems from observational data. Yet the reliability of learned surrogates and symbolic models is often undermined by the fundamental problem of non-uniqueness. The resulting models may fit the available data perfectly, but lack genuine predictive power. This raises the question: under what conditions can the systems governing equations be uniquely identified from a finite set of observations? We show, counter-intuitively, that chaos, typically associated with unpredictability, is crucial for ensuring a system is discoverable in the space of continuous or analytic functions. The prevalence of chaotic systems in benchmark datasets may have inadvertently obscured this fundamental limitation.\n  More concretely, we show that systems chaotic on their entire domain are discoverable from a single trajectory within the space of continuous functions, and systems chaotic on a strange attractor are analytically discoverable under a geometric condition on the attractor. As a consequence, we demonstrate for the first time that the classical Lorenz system is analytically discoverable. Moreover, we establish that analytic discoverability is impossible in the presence of first integrals, common in real-world systems. These findings help explain the success of data-driven methods in inherently chaotic domains like weather forecasting, while revealing a significant challenge for engineering applications like digital twins, where stable, predictable behavior is desired. For these non-chaotic systems, we find that while trajectory data alone is insufficient, certain prior physical knowledge can help ensure discoverability. These findings warrant a critical re-evaluation of the fundamental assumptions underpinning purely data-driven discovery."}

Our Cost Function Landscape Analysis revealed that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm angle parameters $γ$ were largely inactive in the noiseless regime. This insight motivated a parameter-filtered optimization approach, in which we focused the search space exclusively on the active $β$ parameters. This filtering substantially improved parameter efficiency for fast optimizers like Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation (reducing evaluations from 21 to 12 in the noiseless case) and enhanced robustness, demonstrating that leveraging structural insights is an effective architecture-aware noise mitigation strategy for Variational Quantum Algorithms."}

As a main novelty and different from previous results, we deal with the singular limit and therefore cover the true unregularized Hibler stress. To this end, we introduce an energy-based notion of solution that is able to capture plasticity effects of sea ice. This requires certain relaxations of the Hibler energies and, by the different function space set-up, comes with novel challenges. In particular, we establish a bulk approximation result of the boundary terms in the evolutionary relaxed Hibler energies. This is achieved by developing a novel reduction scheme for nonlinear trace expressions which should be of independent interest. Finally, based on our main results, we classify our findings within a broader concept of solutions that is applicable to the non-constant mass case too."}

As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime.
