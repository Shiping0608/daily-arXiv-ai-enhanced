For a parameter $1 \\le p \\le r$, $A_p := \\sum_{i=1}^p \u03c3_i u_i v_i^\\top$ is the best rank $p$ approximation of $A$. In practice, one often chooses $p$ to be small, leading the commonly used phrase \"low-rank approximation\". Low-rank approximation plays a central role in data science because it can substantially reduce the dimensionality of the original data, the matrix $A$. For a large data matrix $A$, one typically computes a rank-$p$ approximation $A_p$ for a suitably chosen small $p$, stores $A_p$, and uses it as input for further computations. The reduced dimension of $A_p$ enables faster computations and significant data compression. In practice, noise is inevitable. We often have access only to noisy data $\\tilde A = A + E$, where $E$ represents the noise. Consequently, the low-rank approximation used as input in many downstream tasks is $\\tilde A_p$, the best rank $p$ approximation of $\\tilde A$, rather than $A_p$.

In this paper, by performing both Kinetic and fluid simulations, we explore the feasibility of a low-recycling regime in the magnetic geometry of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP); kinetic effects come out to be crucial determinants of the SOL dynamics. The simulation results indicate that a high SOL temperature and low SOL density could be achieved even when the divertor target is not made of a low recycling material. This can be done by using a low recycling material as a wall material. This is an important step towards demonstrating the feasibility of a low-recycling scenario.

Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity.

A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region.
