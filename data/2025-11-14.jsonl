In this paper, we first present a fully discrete semi-implicit method for solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation based on the third-order backward differentiation formula and the one-sided extrapolation (using previous time-step numerical values). A projection step is further used to preserve the length of the magnetization. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the fully discrete numerical solution by the introduction of two sets of approximated solutions where one set of solutions solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the other is projected onto the unit sphere. Third-order accuracy in time and fourth order accuracy in space is obtained provided that the spatial step-size is the same order as the temporal step-size and slightly large damping parameter $α$ (greater than $\\sqrt{2}/2$). And also, the unique solvability of the numerical solution without any assumption for the step-size in both time and space is theoretically justified, using a monotonicity analysis. All these theoretical results are guaranteed by numerical examples in both 1D and 3D spaces."}

In addition, despite the extensive use of PINN frameworks for various linear and nonlinear PDEs, no study had previously established rigorous error estimates for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation within a PINN setting. In this work, we overcome the inherent challenges, and establish several global regularity criteria based on space-time integrability conditions in Besov spaces.

The (preconditioned) conjugate gradient (P)CG method is also employed and presented for comparison. The N(P)CG method is defined as a one-dimensional projection with residuals made orthogonal to the current search direction, itself made $A$-orthogonal to the last search direction. The residual orthogonality, expressed via Frobenius inner product, actually holds against all previous search directions, making each iterate globally optimal, that is, that minimizes the Frobenius A-norm of the error over the affine Krylov subspace of $A^2$ generated by the initial gradient. The LO(P)MR method is a two-dimensional projection method that enriches iterates produced by the (preconditioned) minimal residual (P)MR method. These approaches differ from existing descent methods and aim to accelerate convergence compared to other global iteration methods, including (P)MR and (preconditioned) steepest descent (P)SD, previously used for SPAI computation. The methods are implemented with practical dropping strategies to control the growth of nonzero components in the approximate inverse. Numerical experiments are performed in which approximate inverses of several sparse SPD matrices are computed. N(P)CG provides a slight improvement over (P)SD, but remains generally less effective than (P)MR. On the other hand, while (P)CG does improve (P)MR, its convergence is more affected by the dropping of nonzero components, ill-conditioning, and small eigenvalues. LO(P)MR is more robust than (P)MR and (P)CG, consistently outperforms other methods, converging faster to better and often sparser approximations."}

In the regime of rapid rotation, we prove that the time-averaged velocity field remains uniformly bounded in Sobolev norms independent of the rotation rate and converges to a longitude-independent zonal flow depending only on latitude. This shows that the zonalization phenomenon discovered by Cheng and Mahalov on the sphere persists on biaxial ellipsoids, thereby bridging the gap between spherical and ellipsoidal theories of fast rotating Euler dynamics."}

This work introduces a numerical scheme that approximates infinitesimal generators from data sampled on an unknown smooth manifold, enabling the recovery of continuous symmetries without requiring the analytical form of the differential equations. We employ a manifold learning technique, Generalized Moving Least Squares, to prolongate the data, from which a linear system is constructed whose null space encodes the infinitesimal generators representing the symmetries.

Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling."}

Extensive tests on canonical domains (cube and sphere) and a realistic industrial pump-casing geometry demonstrate that HKT consistently matches or surpasses the accuracy of full TSVD/Tikhonov at a fraction of the runtime and memory, while inexpensive TSVD provides the fastest viable reconstructions when only the leading modes are needed. These results show that coupling Krylov projection with TSVD/Tikhonov regularization provides a robust, scalable pathway for MQ-RBF Helmholtz methods in complex three-dimensional settings."}

The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Ampère measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Ampère measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier & Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast.

By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs."}

We establish its connections with other classical tensor decompositions. Furthermore, implicit neural representation (INR) is employed to continuously represent the factor tensors in Multiple decomposition, enabling the method to generalize to non-grid data. We refer to this INR-based Multiple decomposition as Implicit Multiple Tensor Decomposition (IMTD). Then, the Proximal Alternating Least Squares (PALS) algorithm is utilized to solve the IMTD-based tensor reconstruction models.

The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate γ growth rates.

Here we present a combined X-ray imaging (XRM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) approach that bridges this diagnostic gap. Using the Matter in Extreme Conditions end station at LCLS, we irradiated 25-micrometer copper wires with 45-fs, 0.9-J, 800-nm pulses at 3.5e19 W/cm2 while probing with 8.2-keV XFEL pulses. XRM visualizes the evolution of ablation, compression, and inward-propagating fronts with about 200-nm resolution, while SAXS quantifies their nanometer-scale sharpness through the time-resolved evolution of scattering streaks. The joint analysis reveals that an initially smooth compression steepens into a nanometer-sharp shock front after roughly 18 ps, consistent with an analytical steepening model and hydrodynamic simulations. The front reaches a velocity of about 25 km/s and a lateral width of several tens of micrometers, demonstrating for the first time the direct observation of shock formation and decay at solid density with few-nanometer precision. This integrated XRM-SAXS method establishes a quantitative, multiscale diagnostic of laser-driven shocks in dense plasmas relevant to inertial confinement fusion, warm dense matter, and planetary physics."}

We demonstrate that a new numerical scheme (termed `USM-BK' and implemented in the FLASH MHD code) reduces the dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy, constrains the divergence of magnetic field to zero close to machine precision, and resolves smaller-scale structure than other, more conventional schemes, and hence, is the most accurate for simulations of low-Mach turbulent flows among the schemes compared in this work.

In a recent article [E. R. Ingelsten et al. (2025) J. Plasma Phys. 91 E64], we used the data-driven method of sparse regression to discover a novel heat flux closure for electrostatic phenomena. Here, we generalize the six-term closure model found in that work from single- to multi-species modeling. Using data from OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulations over a range of initial conditions, we then demonstrate how the unknown coefficients in front of the three most important terms in the closure can be estimated from box-averaged fluid quantities. Both neural networks and a newly developed framework for nonlinear sparse regression are showcased. The resulting models predict the heat flux for each species with a typical accuracy of 80-90 % and regularly account for 85-95 % of the rate of change in the pressure.

However, the design process is often complicated by uncertainties stemming from unforeseen construction constraints, such as the need to reposition piers or alter geometric characteristics. These design adaptations can lead to repeated redesigns, added costs, and project delays if not anticipated in the early design stages, as well as significant computational overhead when using traditional finite element (FE) simulations. To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR). This methodology supports early-stage uncertainty-informed design, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of reinforced concrete rail bridges in the face of practical constraints and changing site conditions."}

To this end, staircase formation in both the standard and modified Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equations with stochastic forcing, along with two different simple instability driven models -- one from a plasma and from a geophysical context -- are studied and compared. In these studies, it is observed that $β$-plane turbulence that does not distinguish between zonal and non-zonal perturbations (i.e., standard zonal response) gradually forms large-scale, elliptic zonal structures that merge progressively, regardless of whether it is driven by forcing (though it should be slow enough to allow wave couplings) or by the baroclinic instability, using for example a two-layer model. Conversely, the plasma system, with its modified zonal response, can rapidly form straight, stationary jets of well-defined size, again regardless of the way it is driven: by stochastic forcing or by the dissipative drift instability. Furthermore, the instability-driven plasma system exhibits a phase transition between a zonal flow dominated state and an eddy dominated state. In both states, saturation is possible without large-scale friction."}

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a \"compression\" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals.

Capturing these interactions requires a quantitative description that bridges the molecular alterations of AD with the fast electrophysiological dynamics of epilepsy. We introduce a novel mathematical model that extends the Barreto-Cressman ionic formulation by incorporating multiple mechanisms of calcium dysregulation induced by amyloid-$β$, including formation of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable pores, overactivation of voltage-gated $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and suppression of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive potassium currents. The resulting ionic model is coupled with the monodomain equation and discretized using a $p$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes, providing an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy in capturing the sharp spatiotemporal electrical wavefronts associated with epileptiform discharges. Numerical simulations performed on idealized and realistic brain geometries demonstrate that progressive amyloid-\\textbeta{} accumulation leads to severe alterations in calcium homeostasis, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and pathological seizure propagation.

This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate γ growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams."}

A crucial element of a non-Newtonian model is the rheology, which relates inner stresses with strain-rates. We propose a framework for inferring rheological models from data that represents the fluid's effective viscosity with a neural network. By writing the rheological law in terms of tensor invariants and tailoring the network's properties, the inferred model satisfies key physical and mathematical properties, such as isotropic frame-indifference and existence of a convex potential of dissipation. Within this framework, we propose two approaches to learning a fluid's rheology: 1) a standard regression that fits the rheological model to stress data and 2) a PDE-constrained optimization method that infers rheological models from velocity data. For the latter approach, we combine finite element and machine learning libraries. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on land and sea ice rheologies which also depend on external parameters. For land ice, we infer the temperature-dependent Glen's law and, for sea ice, the concentration-dependent shear component of the viscous-plastic model. For these two models, we explore the effects of large data errors. Finally, we infer an unknown concentration-dependent model that reproduces Lagrangian ice floe simulation data. Our method discovers a rheology that generalizes well outside of the training dataset and exhibits both shear-thickening and thinning behaviors depending on the concentrations."}

For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the \"bandgap\", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions."}

In this work, we derive $L_p$-error rate $(p\\ge1)$ for RQMC-based SNIS (RQMC-SNIS) estimators with unbounded integrands on unbounded domains.

The model integrates three behavioral mechanisms, anticipated regret, evolving norms, and uncertainty-dependent trust, within a unified learning framework. Grounded in psychology and behavioral economics, it captures how individuals make probabilistic choices influenced by material payoffs, fear, trust, and social approval. Simulations of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process show that collective outcomes are best when agents display an intermediate level of rationality; they deliberate enough to respond to risk but remain flexible enough to adapt, avoiding the instability of both random and overly rigid decision-making. Regret exerts a dual influence; moderate levels encourage adaptive self-correction, while excessive regret or greed destabilize choices. Uncertainty has a similarly non-linear effect; moderate ambiguity promotes caution, but too much uncertainty disrupts coordination. Social norms restore cooperation by compensating for incomplete information. Among them, personal norms drive behavior when individuals have clear information and moral confidence; injunctive norms, reflecting perceived approval, gain influence under uncertainty; and descriptive norms, based on observing others' actions, serve as informational cues that guide behavior when direct knowledge is limited. Overall, the model provides a psychologically grounded, computationally explicit account of how emotion, cognition, and social norms govern preventive behavior during epidemics."}

Entropically regularized optimal transport (EOT) has become the standard bearer in many statistical applications as it avoids this curse. Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable. However, its potentials are not smooth (do not belong to a Donsker class) and its dual problem is not strongly concave, hence QOT is often assumed to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we show that QOT nevertheless has parametric sample complexity. More precisely, we establish central limit theorems for its dual potentials, optimal couplings, and optimal costs. Our analysis is based on novel arguments that focus on the regularity of the support of the optimal QOT coupling. Specifically, we establish a Lipschitz property of its sections and leverage VC theory to bound its statistical complexity. Our analysis also leads to gradient estimates of independent interest, including $C^{1,1}$ regularity of the population potentials."}

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error."}

This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $η_k$ approaches to 0.

The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions.
