To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions.

For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the \"bandgap\", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Standard SQS calculations underestimate alloy bandgaps due to rare defect-like configurations.

Indeed, EOT has parametric sample complexity, as has been shown in a series of works based on the smoothness of the EOT potentials or the strong concavity of the dual EOT problem. However, EOT produces full-support approximations to the (sparse) OT problem, leading to overspreading in applications, and is computationally unstable for small regularization parameters. The most popular alternative is quadratically regularized optimal transport (QOT), which penalizes couplings by $L^2$ norm instead of relative entropy. QOT produces sparse approximations of OT and is computationally stable.

The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates.

The Escobar problem concerning the existence of a metric conformally equivalent to $g$ having constant scalar curvature on $M$ and constant mean curvature on its boundary is equivalent, in analytic terms, to finding a positive solution to a nonlinear boundary-value problem with critical growth. While the existence of positive solutions to this problem is by now well understood, the existence of sign-changing (nodal) solutions remains largely open. In this work we establish the existence of least-energy sign-changing solutions in two particular cases: the scalar-flat problem, where the scalar curvature on $M$ is zero and the mean curvature of its boundary is constant, and the minimal boundary problem, where the mean curvature of the boundary vanishes and the scalar curvature of $M$ is constant. More precisely, we prove that if $n\\ge7$ and $M$ has a nonumbilic boundary point, then both problems admit least-energy nodal solutions. In addition, we show that when $n\\ge5$, the minimal boundary problem possesses infinitely many sign-changing solutions on the unit ball.
