In particular, the introduced post hoc standardization step of the algorithm, inspired by the sLORETA time-invariant method, reduces the depth bias and thus allows the estimation to appear at the correct depth from the electrode surface. In the current work, we propose first and second-order kinematic evolution models, where the state-space vector includes not only the dipolar source activity but also its velocity and acceleration. Compared to our previous study, this motion model yields smoother and more physically plausible estimates of brain activity even when the measurement noise is high, for both superficial and deep sources. In addition, we introduce a tunable power parameter that enhances the computational efficiency of the algorithm. Our simulation study, which involves thalamic and cortical activity in the somatosensory region, demonstrates that accurate estimation and tracking of both superficial and deep brain activity are feasible."}

Thus, it becomes essential to trap the bremsstrahlung radiation in the hotspot. Through burn simulations incorporating bremsstrahlung emission and reabsorption, we infer the necessary conditions to capture enough radiation to produce scientific breakeven in a pB11 ICF plasma.

Whilst traditional algorithms like LZMA and ZLIB are widely used, they often fail to exploit the deep structure inherent in scientific data. We investigate the application of modern state space models (SSMs) to this problem, which have shown promise for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. We present the Bytewise Online Autoregressive (BOA) Constrictor, a novel, streaming-capable lossless compressor built upon the Mamba architecture. BOA combines an autoregressive Mamba model for next-byte prediction with a parallelised streaming range coder. We evaluate our method on three distinct structured datasets in HEP, demonstrating state-of-the-art compression ratios, improving upon LZMA-9 across all datasets. These improvements range from 2.21$\\times$ (vs. 1.69$\\times$) on the ATLAS dataset to a substantial 44.14$\\times$ (vs. 27.14$\\times$) on the highly-structured CMS dataset, with a modest $\\sim 4.5$MB model size. However, this gain in compression ratio comes with a trade-off in throughput; the Storage-Saving Rate ($σ_{SSR}$) of our prototype currently lags behind highly-optimised CPU-based algorithms like ZLIB. We conclude that while this Mamba-based approach is a highly promising proof-of-principle, significant future work on performance optimisation and hardware portability is required to develop it into a production-ready tool for the HEP community."}

Since the computation of the Galerkin matrix involves double integration over particles, the method can become computationally demanding when the number of obstacles is large. To address this, we also derive a simplified model and consider the Born approximation to improve computational efficiency.

Understanding how plasma discharge modes influence methane decomposition in optimizing plasma-assisted chemical conversion remains unexplored. This study explores the coupling between the discharge structure and product selectivity in RF capacitively coupled discharges operating in methane/inert gas mixtures in the pressure range of 2 to 3 torr. The discharge exhibits mode transitions from uniform to striated in Ar and Kr and from diffuse to contracted in Ar and Kr with 5 percent or less CH4. The discharges in He and Ne remained uniform under our operating conditions, and their mixtures with CH4 remained diffuse. A 0-D model for Ar/CH4 discharge established a threshold for contraction while also asserting the importance of Ar metastable in the dissociation and ionization processes. The highest degree of methane decomposition, 99.7% with the main products of acetylene and graphitized solid carbon was achieved in the contracted discharge mode for both Kr or Ar with 5% or less CH4. We demonstrate that contraction can play a crucial role in the effective decomposition of methane with value-added products and that both the electronic and thermal properties of plasma gas are responsible for this effect."}

We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $λ$-displacement convexity (for any $λ\\in \\mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $λ$-displacement convex (with $λ>0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $λ$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable."}

One promising remedy is to utilize the time-dependent 2-reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that directly represents two-body observables in an N-particle system, and resort to the extended TDDFT for multibody densities to break the confines of spatial local on one-body density [Phys. Rev. Lett. 26(6) (2024) 263001]. However, the usage of 2-RDM is prohibitive due to the augmented dimensionality, e.g., 4-D space for unidimensional 2-RDM. This work addresses the high-dimensional numerical challenges by using an equivalent Wigner phase-space formulation of 2-RDM and seeking efficient spectral approximations to nonlocal quantum potentials. For spatial periodic case, a pseudo-difference operator approach is derived for both the Hartree-exchange-correlation term and two-body collision operator, while the discretization via the Chebyshev spectral element method is provided for non-periodic case. A massively parallel numerical scheme, which integrates these spectral approximations with a distributed characteristics method, allows us to make the first attempt for real simulations of 2-RDM dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the two-body correction to the quantum kinetic theory, and show the increase in the system's entropy induced by the two-bdoy interaction. Thus it may pave the way for an accurate description of 2-RDM dynamics and advance to a practical application of many-body TDDFT."}

Nanoparticles were grown in an Ara and C2H2 mixture using a capacitively coupled RF discharge and the LSPD induced changes in the electron current monitored by a cylindrical Langmuir probe. LSPD signals were obtained and analyzed across different dust growth phases. The prolonged decay of electron current pulses was attributed to the presence of residual negative ions, caused by the effective electrostatic trapping of these ions and the potential post - LSPD re-formation of new ones. The charge per particle was estimated using known values of particle density obtained by laser-light extinction method. For particles with mean diameter Dp ~ 154.3 nm, the charge found to be of Qd~16 elementary charge units. The charge values appear to be lower than the values predicted by orbital motion limited (OML) theory. This deviation is commonly observed in nanodusty plasmas due to significant electron depletion. LSPD results in Ar and C2H2 nano-dusty plasma confirm the applicability of these method for estimating individual nanoparticle charges. However, it has also been demonstrated that electron detachment from residual background negative ions can influence the detachment current decay and must be carefully considered"}

We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves.

The temporal incoherence of broadband lasers modulates the pump intensity, generating stochastic intensity pulses that intermittently drive SBS. The shortened coherence time weakens the three-wave coupling and continuously reduces the temporal growth rate, while the saturated reflectivity remains nearly unchanged until the bandwidth exceeds a critical threshold. Simulations with varying laser intensities and bandwidths reveal a consistent scaling behavior, indicating that effective suppression occurs only when the laser bandwidth exceeds the temporal growth rate of SBS by several tens of times. Comparative simulations in Au and AuB plasmas exhibit similar suppression trends, with AuB showing reduced SBS growth rate and reflectivity, and the onset of suppression occurring at a lower bandwidth. These findings elucidate the coupled dependence of SBS mitigation on bandwidth and laser intensity in high-Z plasmas, offering useful guidance for optimizing broadband laser designs in inertial confinement fusion."}

The main application of the model refers to tumor progression, where the phase variable denotes the local proportion of active cancer cells and the chemical concentration may refer to a nutrient transported by the blood flow or to a drug administered to the patient. The resulting system is characterized by cross-diffusion effects similar to those appearing in the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis; in particular, the nutrient tends to be attracted towards the regions where more active tumor cells are present (and consume it in a quickier way). Complementing various recent results on related models, we investigate here the long-time behavior of solutions under the perspective of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. To this aim, we first identify a regularity setting in which the system is well posed and generates a closed semigroup according to the terminology introduced by Pata and Zelik. Then, partly based on the approach introduced by Rocca and the first author for the Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential, we prove that the semigroup is strongly dissipative and asymptotically compact so guaranteeing the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space. Finally, we discuss the sign properties of the nutrient and prove that, under additional assumptions on the initial data, its concentration is uniformly larger than some strictly positive constant at least on finite time intervals."}

We investigate how to inversely design plasmonic nanostructures using conditional generative adversarial networks. Although a conventional approach of measuring the optical properties of a given nanostructure is conceptually straightforward, inverse design remains difficult because the existence and uniqueness of an acceptable design cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the design space is often large, and simulation-based methods become quickly intractable. Deep learning methods are well-suited to tackle this problem because they can handle effectively high-dimensional input data. We train a conditional generative adversarial network model and use it for inverse design of plasmonic nanostructures based on their extinction cross section spectra. Our main result shows that adding label projection and a novel embedding network to the conditional generative adversarial network model, improves performance in terms of error estimates and convergence speed for the training algorithm. The mean absolute error is reduced by an order of magnitude in the best case, and the training algorithm converges more than three times faster on average. This is shown for two network architectures, a simpler one using a fully connected neural network architecture, and a more complex one using convolutional layers. We pre-train a convolutional neural network and use it as surrogate model to evaluate the performance of our inverse design model. The surrogate model evaluates the extinction cross sections of the design predictions, and we show that our modifications lead to equally good or better predictions of the original design compared to a baseline model.

To accelerate discovery under moderate pressures, an interpretable framework based on symbolic regression is developed to predict Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors. A key descriptor is an integrated density of states (IDOS) within 1 eV of the Fermi level (EF), which exhibits greater robustness than conventional single-point DOS features. The resulting analytic model links electronic-structure characteristics to superconducting performance, achieves high accuracy (RMSEtrain = 20.15 K), and generalizes well to external datasets. By relying solely on electronic structure calculations, the approach greatly accelerates materials screening. Guided by this model, four hydrogen-based candidates are identified and validated via calculation: Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure (exceeding MgB2), and NaCaH12, NaSrH12, and KSrH12 with Tc up to 162.35 K, 86.32 K, and 55.13 K at 100 GPa, 25 GPa, and 25 GPa, respectively.

This provides, in a simplified setting, a rigorous derivation of the slow thermalization predicted by Lenard-Balescu theory.

We propose a quantum spectral method with polylogarithmic complexity for solving non-periodic boundary value problems with arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our method extends the recently proposed approach by Liu et al. (2025), in which periodic problems are discretised using truncated Fourier series. In such spectral methods, the discretisation of boundary value problems with constant coefficients leads to a set of algebraic equations in the Fourier space. We implement the respective diagonal solution operator by first approximating it with a polynomial and then quantum encoding the polynomial. The mapping between the physical and Fourier spaces is accomplished using the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). To impose zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, we double the domain size and reflect all physical fields antisymmetrically. The respective reflection matrix defines the quantum sine transform (QST) by pre- and post-multiplying with the QFT. For non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solution is decomposed into a boundary-conforming and a homogeneous part. The homogenous part is determined by solving a problem with a suitably modified forcing vector. We illustrate the basic approach with a Dirichlet-Poisson problem and demonstrate its generality by applying it to a fractional stochastic PDE for modelling spatial random fields.

We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $λ$-displacement convexity (for any $λ\\in \\mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $λ$-displacement convex (with $λ>0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $λ$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable."}

To approximate the solution of the associated boundary-value problem, we derive an asymptotic model that is valid in the limit as the particle size tends to zero. Our method relies on a boundary integral formulation, semi-discretized in space using a Galerkin approach with appropriately chosen basis functions, s.t. convergence is achieved as the particle size vanishes rather than by increasing the number of basis functions. Since the computation of the Galerkin matrix involves double integration over particles, the method can become computationally demanding when the number of obstacles is large. To address this, we also derive a simplified model and consider the Born approximation to improve computational efficiency. For the high-order models, we provide an error analysis, supported and validated by numerical experiments."}

However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.\n  This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors."}

It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field, instead of the distribution functions, and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. NuFI has been shown to be more accurate than other state-of-the-art Vlasov solvers given the same amount of degrees of freedom as well as interpolation order, essentially making NuFI a high-fidelity but low-memory cost scheme. In this paper, we build on the Hamiltonian structure of the full Vlasov--Maxwell system to extend NuFI to handle electro-magnetic kinetic plasma dynamics. We show that the advanced structure-preserving properties of NuFI are preserved when extending to the electro-magnetic case."}
