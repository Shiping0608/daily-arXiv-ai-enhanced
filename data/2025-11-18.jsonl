The main idea of the proposed approach is that one of the fine-scale variables defines continua. It allows us to formulate macroscopic variables and derive new macroscopic models for nonlinear problems, where coefficients can depend on fine-scale functions. As an example, we consider a fingering problem and employ the fine-scale concentration field to define continua. We consider both Galerkin and mixed multicontinuum modeling approaches. In the former, the multicontinuum theory is applied to the pressure and concentration fields; in the latter, it is also applied to the velocity field. In both approaches, we provide multicontinuum expansions, formulate cell problems, and derive the corresponding macroscopic models. We present numerical results for model problems of gravity-driven fingering, viscous fingering, and interface flattening driven by high-contrast flow. The results show that the macroscopic models, derived with the proposed approach, can provide an accurate representation of the coarse-scale solutions."}

The proposed algorithm relies on prior knowledge about high-frequency components obtained from PDEs. It aims to use this prior knowledge to guide the neural network in rapidly approximating the solution's high-frequency components. The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure. For nonhomogeneous PDEs ($f(x)\\neq c, c\\in R$), we embed the source term as an additional feature into the neural network. The source term typically contains partial or complete frequency information of the target solution, particularly its high-frequency components. This provides prior knowledge about the high-frequency components of the target solution. For homogeneous PDEs, we embed the initial/boundary conditions with high-frequency components into the neural network. Based on spectral bias, we use a fully connected neural network as the low-frequency subnetwork to capture low-frequency components of the target solution. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the FG-PINNs, including the one-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$), the nonlinear wave equations (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$) and the two-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-3})$)."}

In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss.

However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales."}

By examining the method through a collection of small coupling modes, we show that its behavior can be captured by a single scalar quantity for each mode. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations. Examples from finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin settings illustrate how the ideal parameters can be used in practice."}

This population undergoes asexual reproduction, competition, selection, and mutation. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the model, assuming that the mutations have small effects. A standard approach for the analysis of the qualitative properties of the solutions of such an equation is to apply a logarithmic transformation, which yields a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with constraint. When the reproduction term is a concave function of the trait, it has been established that the solution is classical. We rigorously derive a first-order asymptotic expansion of the solution. This expansion allows us to approximate the moments of the phenotypic density. This result establishes a connection between the approximations of the phenotypic density obtained via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach and relevant biological quantities, which are more suitable from a modeling perspective."}

At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping."}

However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($ΔG_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \\href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design."}

The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity.

This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales.

The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator. We present numerous thermoelastic optimization examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed profile generation algorithm and optimization framework."}

In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock. We find that plasma compression at the new thin shock layer is due to compactification of the cold upstream ion beam by high amplitude magnetic field-aligned electrostatic fields. At later stages, the plasma compression expands to form a new sheath."}

The method combines a kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) treatment of the near-wall layer, with a high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as a fluid solver in the bulk flow. Given the kinetic nature of HOLB, this coupling is expected to provide a physically accurate treatment of the near-wall instabilities which trigger the transition to turbulence above a critical threshold around $Re_c \\sim 750$.\n  The coupled DSMC-HOLB solver is validated by simulating plane Poiseuille and Couette flows far from equilibrium, i.e at finite Knudsen number regimes. Based on this validation, we provide the first preliminary evidence that the combination of HOLB and DSMC permits to observe the regeneration cycles of coherent structures which arise above a critical value of the Reynolds number. This task would be hardly attainable by either of the two solvers separately; while DSMC can capture strong near-wall non-equilibrium effects, it lacks the compute power to deal with both near-wall and bulk flow at the same time. We look to HOLB to make it computationally feasible to perform such a simulation. The present two-level coupling procedure may pave the way to a new generation of fluid-kinetic simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows, thus helping to gain deeper insights into the role of wall micro-corrugations in triggering the dynamic instabilities that drive the transition to turbulent regimes."}

We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations."}

Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, where the performance of different (algebraic) coarse spaces is successfully distinguished. A key contribution of this work is the observation that, for certain high-contrast problems, simpler coarse spaces can be made competitive in terms of PCG convergence.

However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy."}

We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver.

We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem.

The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem.

Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems."}

The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena."}

This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.\n  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium.

Building on our earlier work on spatial-derivative nonlinearities, we construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that captures the observed dynamics. We prove that no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, while the generalized self-similar solutions -exhibiting logarithmic growth- provide the correct blow-up description inside backward light cones. We further establish asymptotic stability for the relevant branches, including the ODE-type blow-up in both models.

In this work, we resolve this question under the assumption that the noise coefficients are sufficiently regular in space. Our approach relies on Kunita's stochastic method of characteristics, which allows us to transform the original SPDE-via a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms-into a random PDE to which the classical De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates apply. This program is accomplished through new a-priori estimates for the inverse of stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms, and a novel version of the Itô-Wentzell formula adapted to rough random fields.
