### [1] [Dynamic nonlinear multicontinuum homogenization of systems with intrinsically evolving microstructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11874)
*Mohammed Al-Kobaisi,Dmitry Ammosov,Yalchin Efendiev,Wing Tat Leung,Buzheng Shan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A multicontinuum homogenization approach for nonlinear problems in dynamically evolving multiscale media, using fine-scale variables to define continua and derive macroscopic models with applications to fingering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate macroscopic models for nonlinear problems in multiscale media where traditional homogenization methods may fail, particularly for dynamically evolving systems like fingering phenomena.

Method: Proposes multicontinuum homogenization where fine-scale variables define continua. Considers both Galerkin and mixed approaches - applying multicontinuum theory to pressure/concentration fields (Galerkin) and also to velocity field (mixed). Formulates multicontinuum expansions, cell problems, and derives macroscopic models.

Result: Numerical results for gravity-driven fingering, viscous fingering, and interface flattening show that the derived macroscopic models accurately represent coarse-scale solutions.

Conclusion: The multicontinuum homogenization approach successfully provides accurate macroscopic representations for nonlinear multiscale problems with dynamically evolving media, particularly effective for fingering phenomena.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multicontinuum homogenization approach for nonlinear problems involving dynamically evolving multiscale media. The main idea of the proposed approach is that one of the fine-scale variables defines continua. It allows us to formulate macroscopic variables and derive new macroscopic models for nonlinear problems, where coefficients can depend on fine-scale functions. As an example, we consider a fingering problem and employ the fine-scale concentration field to define continua. We consider both Galerkin and mixed multicontinuum modeling approaches. In the former, the multicontinuum theory is applied to the pressure and concentration fields; in the latter, it is also applied to the velocity field. In both approaches, we provide multicontinuum expansions, formulate cell problems, and derive the corresponding macroscopic models. We present numerical results for model problems of gravity-driven fingering, viscous fingering, and interface flattening driven by high-contrast flow. The results show that the macroscopic models, derived with the proposed approach, can provide an accurate representation of the coarse-scale solutions.

### [3] [FG-PINNs: A neural network method for solving nonhomogeneous PDEs with high frequency components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12055)
*Jiachun Zheng,Yunqing Huang,Nianyu Yi,Yunlei Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: FG-PINNs is a novel physics-informed neural network architecture that uses frequency guidance to solve PDEs with high-frequency components through specialized subnetworks for high and low frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with high-frequency PDE solutions due to spectral bias, where neural networks preferentially learn low-frequency components, making it difficult to capture high-frequency features accurately.

Method: Two-subnetwork architecture: high-frequency subnetwork embeds prior knowledge (source terms for nonhomogeneous PDEs, initial/boundary conditions for homogeneous PDEs) to capture high frequencies; low-frequency subnetwork uses standard FCNN to capture low frequencies based on spectral bias.

Result: Achieved high accuracy across various PDEs: 1D heat equation (relative L² error: O(10⁻⁴)), nonlinear wave equations (O(10⁻⁴)), and 2D heat equation (O(10⁻³)), demonstrating effective handling of high-frequency components.

Conclusion: FG-PINNs successfully address the spectral bias limitation in PINNs by incorporating frequency guidance through specialized subnetworks, enabling accurate solutions for PDEs with high-frequency components across different problem types.

Abstract: In this work, we propose the frequency-guided physics-informed neural networks (FG-PINNs), specifically designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with high-frequency components. The proposed algorithm relies on prior knowledge about high-frequency components obtained from PDEs. It aims to use this prior knowledge to guide the neural network in rapidly approximating the solution's high-frequency components. The FG-PINNs consist of two subnetworks, including a high-frequency subnetwork for capturing high-frequency components and a low-frequency subnetwork for capturing low-frequency components. The key innovation in the high-frequency subnetworks is to embed prior knowledge for high-frequency components into the network structure. For nonhomogeneous PDEs ($f(x)\neq c, c\in R$), we embed the source term as an additional feature into the neural network. The source term typically contains partial or complete frequency information of the target solution, particularly its high-frequency components. This provides prior knowledge about the high-frequency components of the target solution. For homogeneous PDEs, we embed the initial/boundary conditions with high-frequency components into the neural network. Based on spectral bias, we use a fully connected neural network as the low-frequency subnetwork to capture low-frequency components of the target solution. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the FG-PINNs, including the one-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$), the nonlinear wave equations (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-4})$) and the two-dimensional heat equation (relative $L^{2}$ error: $O(10^{-3})$).

### [4] [Discretization, Uniform-in-Time Estimations and Approximation of Invariant Measures for Nonlinear Stochastic Differential Equations with Non-Uniform Dissipativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12124)
*Shan Huang,Xiaoyue Li*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Proposes a Truncated Euler-Maruyama scheme for nonlinear ergodic SDEs, proving numerical ergodicity and uniform convergence rates in Wasserstein distances for both trajectories and invariant measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximating invariant measures for nonlinear ergodic SDEs is crucial for applications in stochastic sampling, physics, and ecology, but existing methods face challenges with convergence and stability.

Method: Develops an explicit Truncated Euler-Maruyama (TEM) scheme using truncation techniques combined with coupling methods to handle nonlinear SDEs while maintaining numerical stability.

Result: Proves numerical ergodicity in L^p-Wasserstein distance, establishes uniform 1/2-order convergence rate in moments, and shows 1/2-order convergence for invariant measures in L^1-Wasserstein distance.

Conclusion: The TEM scheme provides an effective and easily applicable method for approximating invariant measures of nonlinear ergodic SDEs with proven convergence rates, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: The approximation of invariant measures for nonlinear ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a central problem in scientific computing, with important applications in stochastic sampling, physics, and ecology. We first propose an easily applicable explicit Truncated Euler-Maruyama (TEM) scheme and prove its numerical ergodicity in the $L^p$-Wasserstein distance ($p\geqslant 1$). Furthermore, by combining truncation techniques with the coupling method, we establish a uniform-in-time $1/2$-order convergence rate in moments for the TEM scheme. Additionally, leveraging the exponential ergodicity of both the numerical and exact solutions, we derive a $1/2$-order convergence rate for the invariant measures of the TEM scheme and the exact solution in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. Finally, two numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results.

### [5] [A Stochastic Genetic Interacting Particle Method for Reaction-Diffusion-Advection Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12275)
*Boyi Hu,Zhongjian Wang,Jack Xin,Zhiwen Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A stochastic genetic interacting particle method (SGIP) for reaction-diffusion-advection equations using operator splitting, particle drift-diffusion, reaction integration, and adaptive resampling for stability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a particle-based method that can efficiently solve reaction-diffusion-advection equations in complex geometries and higher dimensions, overcoming limitations of traditional grid-based methods.

Method: Operator splitting separates advection-diffusion (handled by particle drift-diffusion) from reactions (handled by exact/implicit integration over bins). Adaptive resampling redistributes particles with evolving density, mimicking genetic mutation.

Result: Method achieves rigorous convergence bounds through comprehensive error analysis. Numerical experiments in 1D-3D show excellent agreement with finite difference methods across various reaction types and flow configurations, with computational advantages for complex geometries.

Conclusion: SGIP provides an effective particle-based alternative to traditional methods for RDA equations, offering stability through adaptive resampling and computational efficiency for complex flow problems in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We develop and analyze a stochastic genetic interacting particle method (SGIP) for reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations. The method employs operator splitting to approximate the advection-diffusion and reaction processes, treating the former by particle drift-diffusion and the latter by exact or implicit integration of reaction dynamics over bins where particle density is estimated by a histogram. A key innovation is the incorporation of adaptive resampling to close the loop of particle and density field description of solutions, mimicking mutation in genetics. Resampling is also critical for maintaining long-term stability by redistributing particles with the evolving density field. We provide a comprehensive error analysis, and establish rigorous convergence bounds under appropriate regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments from one to three space dimensions demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various reaction types (FKPP, cubic, Arrhenius) and flow configurations (shear, cellular, cat's eye, ABC flows), showing excellent agreement with finite difference method (FDM) while offering computational advantages for complex flow geometries and higher-dimensional problems.

### [6] [On the Spectral Clustering of a Class of Multigrid Preconditioners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12298)
*Jose Pablo Lucero Lorca*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a two-level multigrid method for block-structured linear systems, showing how to collapse all nontrivial eigenvalues to a single value through optimal smoothing parameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear understanding of how smoothing and coarse-grid components interact in multigrid methods for block-structured systems and establish an ideal target for practical implementations.

Method: Examines the method through small coupling modes, identifies scalar quantities for each mode, and derives explicit smoothing parameters that cause eigenvalue collapse.

Result: Achieves spectral collapse where all nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator become a single value, providing an ideal benchmark for practical schemes.

Conclusion: The ideal parameter construction serves as a concrete target for designing related multigrid methods and naturally produces operators similar to those used in practical discretizations.

Abstract: This paper studies a common two-level multigrid construction for block-structured linear systems and identifies a simple way to describe how its smoothing and coarse-grid components interact. By examining the method through a collection of small coupling modes, we show that its behavior can be captured by a single scalar quantity for each mode. The main result is an explicit choice of smoothing parameters that makes all modes respond in the same way, causing the nontrivial eigenvalues of the preconditioned operator to collapse to a single value. This gives a clear and self-contained description of the ideal version of the method and provides a concrete target for designing related schemes. Although the exact spectral collapse requires ideal components, we also show that the same construction naturally produces operators that resemble those used in practical discretizations. Examples from finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin settings illustrate how the ideal parameters can be used in practice.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Neural network-based interpolation framework for transferring numerical approximations between unstructured meshes without requiring mesh connectivity or element mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional projection/interpolation methods depend on mesh connectivity and explicit mappings, which are computationally demanding and sensitive to mesh misalignment.

Method: Formulate the problem as data-driven regression using neural networks to predict function values at target locations from scattered nodal data on source mesh.

Result: Identified optimal neural network configuration that balances accuracy and efficiency, performing reliably across various mesh resolutions and topologies.

Conclusion: The framework enables fast, accurate field reconstruction and data transfer without mesh connectivity requirements, as demonstrated in numerical experiments on adaptive meshes.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based interpolation framework for transferring numerical approximations on different unstructured meshes. Traditional projection or interpolation techniques often depend on mesh connectivity, explicit element mappings, or local reconstruction procedures, which can be computationally demanding and sensitive to mesh misalignment. Instead, we formulate the problem as a data-driven regression task that predicts function values at arbitrary target locations from scattered nodal data on the source mesh. By systematically exploring and comparing several neural network architectures, we identify a configuration that balances accuracy and efficiency and that performs reliably across a range of mesh resolutions and topologies. The resulting model enables fast and accurate evaluation without requiring access to mesh connectivity or element-wise information. Numerical experiments on adaptive meshes suggest that the framework is effective for field reconstruction and data transfer tasks. The code used in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [8] [An Efficient Unconditionally Energy-Stable Numerical Scheme for Bose--Einstein Condensate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12411)
*Jing Guo,Cheng Wang,Dong Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A numerical framework for computing Bose-Einstein condensate ground states using gradient flow with explicit time stepping, preserving energy dissipation and L² norm conservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for Bose-Einstein condensates that combines explicit computation with theoretical guarantees like unconditional energy dissipation and norm conservation.

Method: Gradient flow approach with Lagrange multiplier for L² conservation, explicit approximation of chemical potential, exponential time differencing for diffusion, and L² normalization.

Result: The method achieves unconditional free energy dissipation, L² norm conservation at each step, and provides theoretical convergence analysis with optimal error estimates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is the first to combine explicit computation, unconditional energy dissipation, norm conservation, and theoretical convergence guarantees, validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed and analyzed for computing the ground state of Bose--Einstein condensates. A gradient flow approach is developed, incorporating both a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the $L^2$ conservation and a free energy dissipation. An explicit approximation is applied to the chemical potential, combined with an exponential time differencing (ETD) operator to the diffusion part, as well a stabilizing operator, to obtain an intermediate numerical profile. Afterward, an $L^2$ normalization is applied at the next numerical stage. A theoretical analysis reveals a free energy dissipation under a maximum norm bound assumption for the numerical solution, and such a maximum norm bound could be recovered by a careful convergence analysis and error estimate. In the authors' knowledge, the proposed method is the first numerical work that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (1) an explicit computation at each time step, (2) unconditional free energy dissipation, (3) $L^2$ norm conservation at each time step, (4) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate these theoretical results, demonstrating excellent agreement with established reference solutions.

*Linfeng Xia,Heng Yuan,Bo Wang,Wei Cai*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Fast boundary integral method using FMM for acoustic wave scattering in multi-layered 2D media with multiple scatterers, achieving O(N) complexity in low frequency regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve acoustic wave scattering in multi-layered media with multiple scatterers, avoiding unknowns on interfaces and reducing problem size compared to free-space Green's function approaches.

Method: Boundary integral formulation with layered-medium Green's function, discretized by low-order Nyström method, solved by GMRES accelerated by improved layered media FMM and overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning.

Result: Achieves O(N) complexity in low frequency regime, with numerical results validating accuracy, efficiency and robustness under complex settings and various incident angles.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and efficient solver for acoustic wave scattering in layered media.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast boundary integral method accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM) for acoustic wave scattering governed by the scalar Helmholtz equation in multi-layered two-dimensional media. Multiple scatterers are randomly distributed in the multi-layered medium with some scatterers possibly intersecting layer interfaces. The boundary integral formulation employs a layered-medium Green's function to enforce transmission conditions across interfaces, thus avoiding unknowns on the interfaces and significantly reducing the size of the discretized problem compared to approaches that use a free-space Green's function. To demonstrate the FMM speedup, a low-order Nyström method is used to discretize the boundary integral equation and then the resulting dense linear system is solved by GMRES iterative solver accelerated by an improved layered media FMM and a overlapping domain decomposition preconditioning. In the low frequency regime, the proposed algorithm achieves an $\mathcal O(N)$ complexity. Numerical results validate the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the method under complex settings and various incident angles. The proposed framework provides a scalable and efficient solver for acoustic wave scattering in layered media.

*Ying Gao,Hongfei Fu,Xiaoying Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A linear, decoupled, mass- and energy-conserving numerical scheme for multi-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrödinger systems using fourth-order compact differences and relaxation technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, high-order accurate numerical method for multi-dimensional CNLS systems that preserves physical invariants (mass and energy) while being computationally efficient.

Method: Combines fourth-order compact difference approximation in space with relaxation technique in time-staggered mesh framework, solving primal unknowns and auxiliary relaxation variables sequentially.

Result: Proved unique solvability and discrete conservation laws; established optimal-order error estimates without coupling mesh conditions; demonstrated strong performance in long-term simulations maintaining physical invariants and high-order accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme provides an effective, high-order accurate, and physically conservative numerical method for multi-dimensional CNLS systems with rigorous theoretical foundation.

Abstract: This paper presents a linear, decoupled, mass- and energy-conserving numerical scheme for the multi-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) system. The scheme combines the fourth-order compact difference approximation in space with the relaxation technique in a time-staggered mesh framework, solving the primal unknowns and introduced auxiliary relaxation variables sequentially with high efficiency and high-order accuracy. We show the unique solvability and discrete conservation laws of the developed scheme. In particular, for the first time, leveraging an auxiliary error equation system combined with the cut-off technique, optimal-order error estimates in the discrete H1-norm for the primal variables at the time nodes, and in the discrete L2-norm for the auxiliary relaxation variables at the intermediate time nodes, are rigorously proved without any coupling mesh conditions, which contribute to the primary theoretical contribution of this paper for multi-dimensional CNLS system. Numerical experiments demonstrate convincingly the strong performance of the proposed scheme in long-term simulations, maintaining both physical invariants and high-order accuracy.

We analyze the convergence of our algorithms and test their performances with several numerical examples.

### [13] [Sharpened PCG Iteration Bound for High-Contrast Heterogeneous Scalar Elliptic PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12726)
*Philip Soliman,Filipe Cumaru,Alexander Heinlein*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: New PCG iteration bound using clustered eigenspectra edge eigenvalues provides sharper convergence estimates than classical condition number bounds, especially for high-contrast problems with simpler coarse spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical condition number-based bounds for PCG method are too pessimistic for systems with clustered eigenspectra, failing to capture actual convergence behavior accurately.

Method: Developed a new iteration bound using edge eigenvalues of each cluster in the spectral distribution, validated on high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner.

Result: The new bound is orders of magnitude sharper than classical bounds, successfully distinguishes performance of different coarse spaces, and can be estimated from Ritz values in early PCG iterations.

Conclusion: Simpler coarse spaces can be competitive for high-contrast problems, complex preconditioners aren't always needed, and the bound provides practical early convergence estimation.

Abstract: A new iteration bound for the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is presented that more accurately captures convergence for systems with clustered eigenspectra, where the classical condition number-based bound is too pessimistic. By using the edge eigenvalues of each cluster in the spectral distribution, the bound is shown to be orders of magnitude sharper than the classical bound for certain examples. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on a high-contrast elliptic PDE preconditioned with a two-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner, where the performance of different (algebraic) coarse spaces is successfully distinguished. A key contribution of this work is the observation that, for certain high-contrast problems, simpler coarse spaces can be made competitive in terms of PCG convergence. Conversely, more complex preconditioners are not always required. Finally, it is shown that the bound can be estimated effectively from Ritz values computed during early PCG iterations.

### [14] [Error bounds for numerical differentiation using kernels of finite smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12776)
*Oleg Davydov*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Improved error bounds for kernel-based numerical differentiation using growth functions for finite smoothness kernels like polyharmonic splines and Wendland kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing error bounds don't adequately account for the Hölder class smoothness of kernel derivatives, limiting accuracy. Also, standard methods require determining sets for polynomials, which restricts applicability.

Method: Develop new error estimates that incorporate Hölder class smoothness of kernel derivatives and apply to deficient point sets, relaxing polynomial determining set requirements.

Result: The new estimates improve the order of error bounds and extend applicability to more general point configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides more accurate error bounds for kernel-based numerical differentiation and broadens the scope of applicable point sets beyond traditional polynomial determining sets.

Abstract: We provide improved error bounds for kernel-based numerical differentiation in terms of growth functions when kernels are of a finite smoothness, such as polyharmonic splines, thin plate splines or Wendland kernels. In contrast to existing literature, the new estimates take into account the Hölder class smoothness of kernel's derivatives, which helps to improve the order of the estimate. In addition, the new estimates apply to certain deficient point sets, relaxing a standard assumption that an approximation with conditionally positive definite kernels must rely on determining sets for polynomials.

### [15] [Preserving Extreme Singular Values with One Oblivious Sketch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12802)
*John M. Mango,Ronald Katende*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper studies when a single linear sketch can control extreme singular values of rank-r matrices, addressing the gap between classical embeddings requiring Θ(r/ε²) and a conjecture that O(r log r) suffices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical oblivious embeddings provide (1±ε) distortion but fail to give constant-factor control of extreme singular values or condition numbers, which is crucial for numerical stability and iterative solver performance.

Method: Combines sparse oblivious sketches with deterministic geometric balancing maps to collapse nonzero singular values to a common scale, and proves lower bounds on sketch size for relative ε-accurate singular values.

Result: Shows that balancing improves conditioning and accelerates iterative solvers in experiments, while coherent or nearly rank-deficient matrices exhibit predicted failure modes. Proves Ω((r+log(1/δ))/ε²) lower bound for oblivious sketches.

Conclusion: Geometric balancing enables better control of extreme singular values with smaller sketch sizes than classical embeddings, though fundamental limits exist for oblivious sketches achieving relative accuracy.

Abstract: We study when a single linear sketch can control the largest and smallest nonzero singular values of every rank-$r$ matrix. Classical oblivious embeddings require $s=Θ(r/\varepsilon^{2})$ for $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ distortion, but this does not yield constant-factor control of extreme singular values or condition numbers. We formalize a conjecture that $s=O(r\log r)$ suffices for such preservation. On the constructive side, we show that combining a sparse oblivious sketch with a deterministic geometric balancing map produces a sketch whose nonzero singular values collapse to a common scale under bounded condition number and coherence. On the negative side, we prove that any oblivious sketch achieving relative $\varepsilon$-accurate singular values for all rank-$r$ matrices must satisfy $s=Ω((r+\log(1/δ))/\varepsilon^{2})$. Numerical experiments on structured matrix families confirm that balancing improves conditioning and accelerates iterative solvers, while coherent or nearly rank-deficient inputs manifest the predicted failure modes.

Conclusion: The finite-volume algorithm effectively handles the complex wave kinetic equation with combined 3-wave and 4-wave interactions, successfully reproducing the expected energy cascade behavior.

Abstract: Building on recent developments in numerical schemes designed to capture energy cascades for 3-wave kinetic equations~\cite{das2024numerical, walton2022deep, walton2023numerical, walton2024numerical}, we construct in this work a finite-volume algorithm for a significantly more complex wave kinetic equation whose collision operator incorporates both 3-wave and 4-wave interactions. This model arises in the context of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed scheme, and our numerical experiments demonstrate that it successfully captures the energy cascade behavior predicted by the equation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance error analysis for wave equation discretizations using hybrid nonconforming methods like HDG, HHO, and weak Galerkin methods, particularly focusing on time-integrated primal variable estimates.

Method: Hybrid nonconforming space discretization methods including hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG), hybrid high-order (HHO), and weak Galerkin methods on simplices, considering both equal-order and mixed-order settings with piecewise constant unknowns.

Result: Achieved superclose bounds for equal-order case and optimal bounds for mixed-order case on L^2-error of time-integrated primal variable. Developed novel approximation estimates for interpolation operator from HDG literature.

Conclusion: The paper provides improved error estimates for hybrid nonconforming methods applied to wave equations, with key contributions in interpolation operator analysis that enable enhanced convergence rates.

Abstract: We present improved $L^2$-error estimates on the time-integrated primal variable for the wave equation in its first-order formulation. The space discretization relies on a hybrid nonconforming method, such as the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin, the hybrid high-order or the weak Galerkin methods. We consider both equal-order and mixed-order settings on simplices, and include the lowest-order case with piecewise constant unknowns on the faces and in the cells. Our main result is a superclose, resp., optimal bound on the above error in the equal-, resp., mixed-order case. A key result of independent interest to achieve these estimates are novel approximation estimates for an interpolation operator inspired from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin literature.

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether variational principles can be associated with the Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary conditions, deriving time-harmonic energies from Hamilton's principle and constructing coercive augmentations for practical numerical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if energy functionals with clear physical interpretation exist whose stationary points correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary conditions, addressing challenges in accurate approximation at high wavenumbers.

Method: Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, deriving time-harmonic energies, constructing strongly coercive augmentations of indefinite functionals while preserving physical interpretation.

Result: Successfully derived variational principles for the Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary conditions and developed coercive functionals that maintain physical meaning.

Conclusion: The developed variational principles enable practical numerical methods using finite element spaces and neural network architectures for solving Helmholtz problems with impedance boundary conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Variational Principles can be associated with the Helmholtz equation subject to impedance (absorbing) boundary conditions. This model has been extensively studied in the literature from both mathematical and computational perspectives. It is classical with wide applications, yet accurate approximation at high wavenumbers remains challenging. We address the question of whether there exist energy functionals with a clear physical interpretation whose stationary points, the zeros of their first variation, correspond to solutions of the Helmholtz problem. Starting from Hamilton's principle for the wave equation, we derive time-harmonic energies. The resulting functionals are generally indefinite. As a next step, we construct strongly coercive augmentations of these indefinite functionals that preserve their physical interpretation. Finally, we show how these variational principles lead to practical numerical methods based on finite element spaces and neural network architectures.

*Liu Liu,Xueyu Zhu,Zhenyi Zhu*

TL;DR: BI-APNNs framework accelerates training convergence and improves accuracy for semiconductor Boltzmann equation problems by using bi-fidelity decomposition of macroscopic density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow convergence of macroscopic density in near fluid-dynamic regime (small Knudsen numbers) in original APNNs methodology.

Method: Novel bi-fidelity decomposition of macroscopic density ρ, with separate neural network learning only minor correction term ρ_corr, building on micro-macro decomposition from APNNs.

Result: Significantly accelerates training convergence, improves forward problem accuracy in fluid-dynamic limit, and yields more accurate/robust inverse problem results compared to standard APNNs.

Conclusion: Bi-fidelity formulation is powerful enhancement for multiscale kinetic equations, especially effective for inverse problems with partial observation data.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Bi-fidelity Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (BI-APNNs) framework, designed to efficiently solve forward and inverse problems for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation. Our approach builds upon the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNNs) methodology \cite{APNN-transport}, which employs a micro-macro decomposition to handle the model's multiscale nature. We specifically address a key bottleneck in the original APNNs: the slow convergence of the macroscopic density $ρ$ in the near fluid-dynamic regime, i.e., for small Knudsen numbers $\varepsilon$. The core innovation of BI-APNNs is a novel bi-fidelity decomposition of the macroscopic quantity $ρ$, which accurately approximates the true density at small $\varepsilon$, and can be efficiently pre-trained. A separate and more compact neural network is then tasked with learning only the minor correction term, $ρ_{\text{corr}}$. This strategy not only significantly {\it accelerates} the training convergence but also improves the accuracy of the forward problem solution, particularly in the challenging fluid-dynamic limit. Meanwhile, we demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that our new BI-APNNs yields substantially more accurate and robust results for inverse problems compared to the standard APNNs. Validated on both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson systems, our work shows that the bi-fidelity formulation is a powerful enhancement for tackling multiscale kinetic equations, especially when dealing with inverse problems constrained by partial observation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous discrete exponential convergence results from perturbative framework to broader class of exponentially decaying initial data without requiring proximity to equilibrium.

Method: Finite-volume discretization analysis using Boltzmann entropy properties, propagation of initial L∞ bounds from scheme monotonicity, and controlled linearizations within nonlinear entropy estimates.

Result: Established discrete exponential convergence to equilibrium for broader class of initial data, with time-discrete dissipation providing crucial stabilization and control over nonlinear terms.

Conclusion: The numerical scheme's inherent time-discrete dissipation plays essential stabilizing role, enabling extension of convergence results beyond perturbative framework.

Abstract: In this article, we study the long-time behavior of a finite-volume discretization for a nonlinear kinetic reaction model involving two interacting species. Building upon the seminal work of [Favre, Pirner, Schmeiser, ARMA, 2023], we extend the discrete exponential convergence to equilibrium result established in [Bessemoulin-Chatard, Laidin, Rey, IMAJNA, 2025], which was obtained in a perturbative framework using weighted $L^2$ estimates. The analysis applies to a broader class of exponentially decaying initial data, without requiring proximity to equilibrium, by exploiting the properties of the Boltzmann entropy. The proof relies on the propagation of the initial $L^\infty$ bounds, derived from monotonicity properties of the scheme, allowing controlled linearizations within the nonlinear entropy estimates. Moreover, we show that the time-discrete dissipation inherent to the numerical scheme plays a crucial stabilizing role, providing control over the nonlinear terms.

Motivation: To establish rigorous error bounds for numerical approximations of mean field game systems, which are important in modeling large populations of rational agents.

Method: Express MFG solutions as zeros of a nonlinear abstract mapping, characterize stability via invertibility of differential, apply Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem with discrete Lp maximal regularity estimates.

Result: Proved existence of solutions to semidiscrete MFG system and derived error estimates; established quasi-optimal error bounds for sufficiently regular solutions.

Conclusion: The approach provides theoretical foundation for finite element approximations of mean field games, with quasi-optimal convergence rates under sufficient regularity conditions.

Abstract: We derive a priori error estimates for semidiscrete finite element approximations of stable solutions to time-dependent mean field game systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Expressing solutions to the MFG system as zeros of a nonlinear abstract mapping, we show that the stability of solutions is equivalent to the invertibility of its differential. This characterization allows us to apply the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart approximation theorem in combination with discrete L p maximal regularity estimates to prove existence of solutions to the semidiscrete MFG system and to derive the error estimate. Finally, for solutions satisfying sufficient regularity assumptions, we establish quasi-optimal error bounds, meaning the approximation achieves the best possible convergence rate when the solution has sufficient smoothness.

Motivation: To address computational challenges in kinetic simulations by reducing costs while maintaining accuracy, exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models.

Method: Integrates parareal temporal parallelization with dynamic spatial domain adaptation using perturbative analysis, employing coarse fluid solver for temporal propagation and fine kinetic solver for resolution, with domain adaptation criteria based on velocity equilibrium deviation and macroscopic quantities.

Result: Significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution, demonstrating substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The fully hybrid methodology effectively handles stiffness through asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition and provides an efficient approach for kinetic simulations across various regimes.

Abstract: We present a novel multiscale numerical approach that combines parallel-in-time computation with hybrid domain adaptation for linear collisional kinetic equations in the diffusive regime. The method addresses the computational challenges of kinetic simulations by integrating two complementary strategies: a parareal temporal parallelization method and a dynamic spatial domain adaptation based on perturbative analysis. The parallel in time approach employs a coarse fluid solver for efficient temporal propagation coupled with a fine, spatially-hybridized, kinetic solver for accurate resolution. Domain adaptation is governed by two criteria: one measuring the deviation from local velocity equilibrium, and another based on macroscopic quantities available throughout the computational domain. An asymptotic preserving micro-macro decomposition framework handles the stiffness of the original problem. This fully hybrid methodology significantly reduces computational costs compared to full kinetic approaches by exploiting the lower dimensionality of asymptotic fluid models while maintaining accuracy through selective kinetic resolution. The method demonstrates substantial speedup capabilities and efficiency gains across various kinetic regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed solver provides a practical solution for resilient eigenvalue computations in large-scale systems, maintaining performance while tolerating hardware failures.

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems serve as fundamental substrates for applications in large-scale scientific simulations and machine learning, often requiring computation on massively parallel platforms. As these platforms scale to hundreds of thousands of cores, hardware failures become a significant challenge to reliability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel fault-tolerant eigenvalue solver based on erasure-coded computations -- a technique that enhances resilience by augmenting the system with redundant data a priori. This transformation reformulates the original eigenvalue problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem, enabling fault-oblivious computation while preserving numerical stability and convergence properties. We formulate the augmentation scheme, establish the necessary conditions for the encoded blocks, and prove the relationship between the original and transformed problems. We implement an erasure-coded TraceMin eigensolver and demonstrate its effectiveness in extracting eigenvalues in the presence of faults. Our experimental results show that the proposed solver incurs minimal computational overhead, maintains robust convergence, and scales efficiently with the number of faults, making it a practical solution for resilient eigenvalue computations in large-scale systems.

Conclusion: The model provides a thermodynamically consistent framework with rigorous mathematical foundations, bridging phase-field approaches with classical fluid dynamics in non-isothermal settings.

Abstract: We propose a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for the flow of a mixture of two different viscous incompressible fluids of equal density in a bounded domain. We prove the well-posedness of local-in-time strong solutions by means of maximal regularity and contraction mapping arguments. We introduce a suitable entropic weak formulation of the problem, replacing the heat equation by the total energy inequality and an entropy production inequality, and we rigorously prove global-in-time existence of such weak solutions, developing a novel approximation scheme. We also show that an entropic weak solution to this non-isothermal phase-field model converges to a distributional (or $BV$) solution to a non-isothermal Navier--Stokes/mean curvature flow, under an energy convergence assumption.

Motivation: To extend the understanding of Fokker-Planck equations from finite to infinite graphs, developing mathematical tools for analyzing gradient flow structures and long-term behavior in infinite-dimensional settings.

Method: Constructs infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifold structure using novel classification method for injectivity and functional analysis for surjectivity. Uses relative energy method, approximation techniques, and continuity arguments to study the ODE system.

Result: Proves global existence and asymptotic convergence of solutions, demonstrates gradient flow structure with exponential convergence to unique Gibbs distribution, establishes local Talagrand-type inequality, and compares Hilbert manifold metric with Wasserstein distances.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends gradient flow analysis to infinite graphs, providing mathematical foundations for studying Fokker-Planck equations in infinite-dimensional settings with convergence guarantees and metric comparisons.

Abstract: We study the gradient flow structure and long-time behavior of Fokker-Planck equations (FPE) on infinite graphs, along with a Talagrand-type inequality in this setting. We begin by constructing an infinite-dimensional Hilbert manifold structure, extending the approach of [S. N. Chow, W. Huang, Y. Li, H. M. Zhou, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 203, 969-1008 (2012)] through a novel classification method to establish injectivity of the map from quotient space to tangent space and employing functional analysis techniques to prove surjectivity. Using a combination of the relative energy method, approximation techniques, and continuity arguments, we establish the global existence and asymptotic convergence of solutions to the infinite-dimensional ODE system associated with the FPE. Specifically, we demonstrate that the FPE admits a gradient flow structure, with solutions converging exponentially to the unique Gibbs distribution. Furthermore, we prove a local Talagrand-type inequality and compare the Hilbert manifold metric induced by our framework with classical Wasserstein distances.

Motivation: To extend Calderón's inverse conductivity problem to anisotropic manifolds where conductivity depends on both electric potential and field, which has applications in medical imaging and geophysics.

Method: Analysis on conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds using boundary voltage-current measurements to determine conductivity derivatives and establish unique recovery conditions.

Result: Proves that all derivatives of conductivity with respect to potential and field at zero field are uniquely determined by boundary measurements, and full unique recovery when conductivity is analytic in the field variable.

Conclusion: Boundary measurements suffice to determine conductivity properties in anisotropic settings with potential-dependent conductivity, with complete recovery possible under analyticity conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates Calderón's problem on a conformally transversally anisotropic manifold $ (M,g) $ of dimension $n \geq 3$, where the conductivity $ a(s,x,p) $ might depend on both the electric potential and the electric field.

Motivation: To analyze evolutionary dynamics of populations structured by phenotypic traits undergoing asexual reproduction, competition, selection, and mutation, particularly focusing on small-effect mutations.

Method: Apply logarithmic transformation to convert integro-differential equation into Hamilton-Jacobi equation with constraint, then derive first-order asymptotic expansion assuming small mutation effects.

Result: Successfully derived rigorous first-order asymptotic expansion of solution, enabling approximation of phenotypic density moments and connecting Hamilton-Jacobi approach with biologically relevant quantities.

Conclusion: The method establishes a bridge between mathematical Hamilton-Jacobi solutions and biologically meaningful phenotypic density approximations, making the approach more suitable for modeling purposes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an integro-differential equation which describes the evolutionary dynamics of a population structured by a phenotypic trait. This population undergoes asexual reproduction, competition, selection, and mutation. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the model, assuming that the mutations have small effects. A standard approach for the analysis of the qualitative properties of the solutions of such an equation is to apply a logarithmic transformation, which yields a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with constraint. When the reproduction term is a concave function of the trait, it has been established that the solution is classical. We rigorously derive a first-order asymptotic expansion of the solution. This expansion allows us to approximate the moments of the phenotypic density. This result establishes a connection between the approximations of the phenotypic density obtained via the Hamilton-Jacobi approach and relevant biological quantities, which are more suitable from a modeling perspective.

TL;DR: The paper studies boundary regularity at infinity for p-Laplace type equations in unbounded domains, using Wiener-type integrals and circular inversion to transform the problem from infinity to the origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize boundary regularity at infinity for nonlinear elliptic equations in unbounded domains, particularly for p-Laplace type equations when p ≥ n ≥ 2.

Method: Uses circular inversion to map infinity to the origin, transforming the original nonlinear equation to a similar weighted equation. Then applies Wiener criterion at the origin and transforms it back to provide Wiener-type criteria at infinity.

Result: For p > n, infinity is regular if and only if the boundary ∂Ω is unbounded. For p = n, this simplified criterion does not hold, as shown by a counterexample. The simplified criterion also extends to p-harmonic functions in Ahlfors Q-regular metric measure spaces with Q < p.

Conclusion: The paper establishes Wiener-type criteria for boundary regularity at infinity in unbounded domains for p-Laplace equations, with different behavior observed between p > n and p = n cases.

Abstract: We study boundary regularity at the infinity point $\boldsymbol{\infty}$ for nonlinear elliptic equations of $p$-Laplace type in unbounded open sets $Ω\subset \mathbf{R}^n$. We consider the case $p \ge n \ge 2$ and characterize the regularity at $\boldsymbol{\infty}$ by means of Wiener-type integrals. Our approach uses circular inversion, which maps $\boldsymbol{\infty}$ to the origin and the original nonlinear equation to a similar weighted equation. The Wiener criterion at the origin for such equations is then transformed back to provide Wiener-type criteria at $\boldsymbol{\infty}$. When $p>n$, the criteria simplify so that $\boldsymbol{\infty}$ is regular if and only if the boundary $\partialΩ$ is unbounded. For $p=n$ this is not true, as shown by an example. This simplified criterion is also proved for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded open subsets of Ahlfors $Q$-regular metric measure spaces with $Q<p$, supporting a Poincaré inequality.

Conclusion: The proposed control strategies effectively manage mosquito populations by stabilizing aquatic stage dynamics and tracking desired population trajectories, offering promising approaches for malaria vector control.

Abstract: This paper presents an age-structured, non-autonomous logistic model describing the aquatic and adult stages of the dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes. We propose a biological control strategy targeting the aquatic compartment and implement a tracking control for its emergence. A feedback control law guarantees stabilization of the emergent population density, specifically the global asymptotic stability of the logistic model. Additionally, a feedforward controller combined with feedback is introduced to steer the emergent density toward a time-varying reference trajectory. The analytical findings are corroborated and illustrated by numerical simulations.

Abstract: We revisit the vortex filament conjecture for three-dimensional inviscid and incompressible Euler flows with helical symmetry and no swirl. Using gluing arguments, we provide the first construction of a smooth helical vortex filament in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose cross-sectional vorticity is compactly supported in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for all times. The construction extends to a multi-vortex solution comprising several helical filaments arranged along a regular polygon. Our approach yields fine asymptotics for the vorticity cores, thus improving related variational results for smooth solutions in bounded helical domains and infinite pipes, as well as non-smooth vortex patches in the whole space.

*Zexin Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies uniform regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to a Lotka-Volterra strong competition system with Dirichlet boundary conditions, establishing optimal uniform boundedness results and sharp interface estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous results on uniform regularity from symmetric coefficients and homogeneous competition terms to the more general asymmetric and nonhomogeneous case, providing optimal regularity estimates.

Method: Develops an Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman type monotonicity formula for the system and employs blow-up analysis to prove uniform interior and global Lipschitz boundedness as β→∞.

Result: Proves that uniform boundedness of solutions implies uniform interior and global Lipschitz boundedness as β→∞, and derives sharp quantitative pointwise estimates for densities near interfaces between different components.

Conclusion: The established uniform optimal regularity results are optimal and extend previous work to asymmetric coefficients and nonhomogeneous competition terms, with applications to interface behavior analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the uniform regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the following Lotka-Volterra type system of strong competition with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
  \begin{align*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -Δu_{i,β} = f_{i,β}(x, u_{i,β}) - βu_{i,β}^{p_i} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}}^k a_{ij} u_{j,β}^{p_j}, \quad u_{i,β} > 0 & \text{in } Ω,
  u_{i,β} = \varphi_{i,β} & \text{on } \partialΩ,
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{align*}
  where $N \geq 1$, $1 \leq i \leq k$ with $k \geq 3$, $β> 0$, $p_i \geq 1$, $a_{ij} > 0$ for $i \neq j$, and $Ω$ is a $C^{1,\text{Dini}}$ bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$. First, we prove that the uniform boundedness of the solutions implies their uniform interior and global Lipschitz boundedness as $β\to +\infty$. Such uniform results are optimal; partial versions thereof are known in the literature for symmetric coefficients (i.e., $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for all $i \neq j$) and homogeneous competition terms (i.e., $p_i = 1$ for all $i$). Here, we establish an Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman type monotonicity formula for the system and then employ blow-up analysis to show that these results also hold in the asymmetric or nonhomogeneous case. Next, as consequences of the uniform optimal regularity, we derive sharp quantitative pointwise estimates for the densities near the interface between different components.

*Pritam Ganguly*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper extends the classical Rellich theorem to rank-one Riemannian symmetric spaces, establishing sharp L^p-growth estimates for eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and proving nonexistence of L^p-solutions for optimal parameter ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the classical Euclidean Rellich theorem to non-Euclidean settings, specifically rank-one Riemannian symmetric spaces including hyperbolic spaces, and understand how exponential volume growth affects spectral properties.

Method: Study eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in exterior domains, analyze asymptotic behavior and L^p-integrability of solutions to the Helmholtz equation using geometric analysis techniques.

Result: Obtained sharp Rellich-type quantitative L^p-growth estimates in geodesic annuli, proved nonexistence of L^p-solutions for optimal range 1≤p≤2 and spectral parameters satisfying |Im(λ)|≤(2/p-1)ρ, and established a Rellich-type uniqueness theorem using Hardy-type norms.

Conclusion: The results geometrically extend the Euclidean Rellich theorem, revealing that exponential volume growth and p-dependent L^p-spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator give rise to genuinely non-Euclidean spectral phenomena.

Abstract: We study eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $Δ_X$ in exterior domains $Ω$ of rank-one Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type $X$, a class that includes all hyperbolic spaces. Extending the classical $L^2$-Rellich theorem for the Euclidean Laplacian, we investigate the asymptotic behavior and $L^p$-integrability of solutions to the Helmholtz equation
  \[
  Δ_X f + (λ^2 + ρ^2) f = 0 \quad \text{in } Ω,
  \]
  where $λ\in \mathbb{C}\setminus i\mathbb{Z}$ and $ρ$ is the half-sum of positive roots.
  We obtain sharp Rellich-type quantitative $L^p$-growth estimates of~$f$ in geodesic annuli, leading to the nonexistence of $L^p(Ω)$-solutions for the optimal range $1 \leq p \leq 2$ and spectral parameters $λ$ satisfying $|Im(λ)| \leq (2/p - 1)ρ$. As a by-product of our study, we also establish a Rellich-type uniqueness theorem for eigenfunctions in terms of Hardy-type norms. Our results geometrically extend the Euclidean Rellich theorem, revealing how exponential volume growth and the dependence of the $L^p$-spectrum of $Δ_X$ on $p$ give rise to genuinely non-Euclidean spectral phenomena.

*Gustavo de Paula Ramos*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves existence of ground states for normalized semilinear elliptic problems with point interactions in specific parameter regimes where such solutions don't exist without the point interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the existence of ground state solutions for normalized semilinear elliptic problems with point interactions, particularly in parameter regimes where similar solutions are absent in the standard defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation framework.

Method: The authors use mathematical analysis to prove that for specific parameter combinations (N=2 with p>2, or N=3 with α<0 and 2<p<3), there exists a computable threshold μ₀ such that for 0<μ<μ₀, the normalized semilinear elliptic problem with point interaction admits ground states.

Result: The main result shows that ground state solutions exist for the given normalized semilinear elliptic problem with point interaction when the parameters satisfy the specified conditions and the normalization constant μ is below a computable threshold μ₀.

Conclusion: Point interactions can enable the existence of ground state solutions in normalized semilinear elliptic problems in parameter regimes where such solutions are absent in the standard defocusing NLSE without point interactions.

Abstract: Suppose that either (i) $N = 2$, $α\in \mathbb{R}$ and $p > 2$ or (ii) $N = 3$, $α< 0$ and $2 < p < 3$. We prove that there exists an explicitly computable $μ_0 = μ_0 (N, α, p) > 0$ such that if $0 < μ< μ_0$, then the following normalized semilinear elliptic problem with a point interaction admits ground states: \[ \begin{cases} - Δ_αu + ωu + u |u|^{p - 2} = 0 &\text{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^N; \\ \|u\|_{\mathscr{L}^2}^2 = μ, \end{cases} \] where $- Δ_α$ denotes the Laplacian of point interaction (centered at the origin) with inverse scattering length $- 2 (N - 1) πα$ and we want to solve for $ω\in \mathbb{R}$, $u \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$. We remark that this kind of solutions does not exist in the framework of the defocusing NLSE without a point interaction.

*Aritro Pathak*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Provides pointwise upper and lower bounds for Green's function of elliptic operators with Laplacian principal part and boundary-diverging drift terms in unit balls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish Green's function estimates for non-coercive elliptic operators with singular drift terms near boundaries, where traditional energy methods fail.

Method: Develops techniques to obtain bounds for operators with drift terms diverging near boundary like inverse distance powers (exponent < 1), using explicit constants and local uniform estimates.

Result: Obtains first such estimates for non-coercive drifts with explicit dependence on radius, valid for C^{1,α} locally regular drifts and those majorized by radially integrable functions.

Conclusion: These are pioneering estimates for singular drift settings, suggesting extensions to more general singular potentials and scenarios where conventional methods are inapplicable.

Abstract: We introduce a technique to obtain pointwise upper and lower bounds for the Green's function of elliptic operators whose principal part is the Laplacian and that include a drift term diverging near the boundary like a power of the inverse distance with exponent less than 1, in the unit ball B(0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 3. The constants in the upper estimates are uniform in B(0,r) for each r < 1, with explicit dependence on r. The drift here belongs to C^{1,α}_{\mathrm{loc}} and may, more generally, be majorized by a function radially integrable up to the boundary. These appear to be the first such estimates for non-coercive drifts and remain new even for smooth drifts, suggesting extensions to singular potentials and other settings where energy methods fail.

### [41] [BMO solvability with singular drifts on ample sawtooth domains implies $L^p$ solvability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12747)
*Aritro Pathak*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows that for elliptic operators with singular drifts satisfying Carleson measure conditions, BMO solvability in 'ample' sawtooth domains implies weak A∞ condition for elliptic measure, which is equivalent to Lp Dirichlet problem solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish quantifiable absolute continuity conditions for elliptic measures with singular drifts, extending previous perturbative Lp Dirichlet solvability results by Hofmann-Lewis and Kenig-Pipher.

Method: Using 'ample' sawtooth domains of the unit ball where boundaries coincide with the unit ball except for arbitrarily small fractions, and proving that BMO solvability in these subdomains implies weak A∞ condition.

Result: BMO solvability in ample sawtooth domains implies elliptic measure satisfies weak A∞ condition with respect to surface measure, equivalent to Lp Dirichlet problem solvability for some 1<p<∞.

Conclusion: The results provide a quantifiable connection between BMO solvability and weak A∞ conditions for elliptic measures with singular drifts, with methods extendable to general bounded Lipschitz domains.

Abstract: For a linear elliptic operator with a singular drift that satisfies a finite Carleson measure condition, we prove that there exist `ample' sawtooth domains of the unit ball $B(0,1)\subset \R^{n+1}$ so that a BMO solvability assumption in these sawtooth subdomains implies that the elliptic measure satisfies the weak $A_\infty$ condition with respect to the surface measure on this `ample' sawtooth domain. This is a quantifiable absolute continuity condition, which is equivalent to saying the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem is solvable for some $1<p<\infty$. Such singular drifts have been considered in the literature in the context of perturbative $L^p$ Dirichlet solvability problems, by Hofmann-Lewis and Kenig-Pipher. By an ample sawtooth domain, we mean a sawtooth domain whose boundary coincides with the boundary of the unit ball, except for an arbitrarily small fraction. The methods can be naturally extended to show the result for more general bounded Lipschitz domains.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of fully nonlinear second-order mean field games with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, showing existence and uniqueness results through variational inequality reformulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address MFG systems with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, which appear in various applications but lack comprehensive theoretical analysis, particularly regarding existence and uniqueness.

Method: Reformulate the partial differential inclusion (PDI) as a nonstandard variational inequality (VI), prove existence on bounded convex domains using uniform ellipticity and Cordes condition, and show uniqueness for strictly monotone couplings.

Result: Established existence of solutions for stationary MFG systems with general coupling operators and nonnegative distributional source terms, and proved uniqueness for strictly monotone couplings.

Conclusion: The MFG PDI/VI system can be obtained as limits of PDE systems with differentiable Hamiltonians, with continuous dependence of solutions demonstrated.

Abstract: We analyse fully nonlinear second-order mean field games (MFG) with nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, which take the form of a coupled system of a fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and a Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck partial differential inclusion (PDI) featuring the set-valued subdifferential of the Hamiltonian. We show the existence of solutions of some stationary MFG systems with quite general coupling operators and nonnegative distributional source terms, on general bounded convex domains, under the primary assumptions of uniform ellipticity and the Cordes condition on the diffusion coefficient. The existence proof is founded on an original, and equivalent, reformulation of the PDI as a nonstandard variational inequality (VI), that offers significant flexibility in passages to limits. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the solution of the PDI/VI system is proved in the case of strictly monotone couplings. We then show how the MFG PDI/VI system in the fully nonlinear setting can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of PDE systems with differentiable Hamiltonians, and we give further results on the continuous dependence of the solution.

*Yubo Chen,Wendong Wang,Guoxu Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows that sufficiently strong Couette flow can prevent finite-time blow-up in 2D Patlak-Keller-Segel systems by providing mixing effects that inhibit bacterial concentration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how external flows can prevent blow-up in chemotaxis systems, specifically investigating the stabilizing effect of Couette flow on the Patlak-Keller-Segel system where solutions normally blow up when initial mass exceeds 8π.

Method: Analyze the Patlak-Keller-Segel system near Couette flow (Ay,0) on ℝ², establishing quantitative conditions on the amplitude A that ensure global existence of solutions rather than finite-time blow-up.

Result: Proved that if the Couette flow amplitude A is sufficiently large (with explicit bound C* < 2,058,614), solutions remain global in time. Similar results hold for the coupled Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with appropriate amplitude conditions.

Conclusion: Strong Couette flow provides effective mixing that prevents concentration and blow-up in chemotaxis systems, with precisely quantified amplitude thresholds for global existence.

Abstract: When the initial mass of the density function is greater than $8 π$, the solutions to the 2D Patlak-Keller-Segel system will blow up in a finite time on $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this paper, we investigate the mixing effect arising from a Couette flow with quantized amplitude, which makes it difficult for bacteria to concentrate. For the Patlak-Keller-Segel system near Couette flow $(Ay,0)$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is proved that if the amplitude $A$ is sufficiently large in the form of $C_* \left(\| \langle D_x\rangle^{m} \langle {D_x}^{-1}\rangle^εn_{\mathrm{in}} \|_{L^2}^2+1\right)^{{9}/{2}} < \infty$, the solutions are global in time. In particular, in this case, an upper bound for $C_*$ is precisely estimated as $2,058,614$. For the Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system near Couette flow on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is also proved that if the amplitude is sufficiently large in the form of $C_*\|(n_{\rm in}, |D_x|^{1/3} n_{\rm in},ω_{\rm in})\|_{Y_{m,ε}}^9$, the solutions are global in time.

### [44] [The doubling property of the elliptic measure, for elliptic operators with drifts satisfying an average diverging condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12942)
*Aritro Pathak*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper shows doubling of elliptic measure for operators with drift terms that diverge like inverse distance to boundary on average, under small Carleson constant conditions, generalizing previous pointwise smallness results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend elliptic measure doubling results from pointwise small drift conditions to average smallness conditions (Carleson measure type), connecting to recent perturbative Dirichlet solvability results in domains with drifts.

Method: Working in 1-sided chord arc domains, using Hardy inequalities with Alhfors-David regular boundary via stopping time arguments.

Result: Established doubling of elliptic measure for operators with divergent drift terms under small Carleson constant assumptions, new even for half-space.

Conclusion: Generalizes earlier drift smallness conditions from pointwise to average (Carleson) conditions, providing new elliptic measure doubling results in various domain types.

Abstract: We show doubling of the elliptic measure corresponding to the operator with an elliptic principal term and a drift that diverges, on average on Whitney cubes, like the inverse distance to the boundary, with a small constant. Essentially a small Carleson constant assumption on the drift, this generalizes earlier results with the hypothesis of pointwise smallness of such a drift. This relates to recent perturbative results of rough Dirichlet solvability in domains with drifts or potentials that satisfy a Carleson measure condition, which have also been considered earlier by Hofmann-Lewis and Kenig-Pipher. While we work in 1-sided chord arc domains, these results are new even for the half-space. In the process, we also prove Hardy inequalities in such domains with Alhfors-David regular boundary, using a stopping time argument.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses open problem (Problem 11b) by Yudovich regarding vanishing viscosity limits in mathematical hydrodynamics, specifically for rotating boundary conditions.

Method: Constructs solution using higher order asymptotic approximation and boundary layer expansion. Applies Prandtl-Batchelor theory with rotation flow A/r e_θ determined by Batchelor-Wood formula.

Result: Successfully establishes vanishing viscosity limit and validates boundary layer expansion. Obtains asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity. Also provides existence result for large perturbations of fast rotation.

Conclusion: Partially resolves Yudovich's open problem and provides theoretical foundation for vanishing viscosity limits in rotating boundary flow problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the vanishing viscosity limit result of the 2D stationary Navier-Stokes equations outside a rotating disc. On the boundary of the disc, the fluid is subjected to a small perturbation of a non zero rotation of rigid body. While at the spacial infinity, the fluid stays at rest. Due to the Prandtl-Batchelor theory, the limiting Euler solution is chosen to be the rotation flow $\frac{A}{r} e_θ$ for some suitable constant $A$, which is determined by the Batchelor-Wood formula. When the viscosity approaches to zero, we will construct a solution to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations by using higher order asymptotic approximation and show the validity of the boundary layer expansion. Also the asymptotic behavior of the solution at spacial infinity is obtained. Our result partially answers one of the open problems (Problem 11b) raised by V. I. Yudovich in [Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737].
  As an application, we can show an existence result to the 2D stationary Navier-Stokes equations with fixed viscosity outside a disc when the fluid is subjected to a large perturbation of a fast rotation of rigid body at the boundary.

*Atsushi Nakayasu,Takayuki Yamada*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper extends the mathematical analysis of a PDE-based thickness measure from simple geometries to annular domains with curvature, proving convergence to geometric thickness as diffusion parameter approaches zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to rigorously validate the PDE-based thickness formulation for general shapes beyond simple geometries, as its convergence to geometric thickness had only been proven for intervals and straight bands.

Method: The authors used mathematical analysis of elliptic PDEs on annular domains, employing modified Bessel functions and estimating the difference between PDE-based and geometric thickness with respect to the diffusion parameter.

Result: The paper proves that PDE-based thickness converges to geometric thickness as diffusion parameter tends to zero, with explicit expressions involving modified Bessel functions for annuli and sharp inequalities for their ratios.

Conclusion: The results provide rigorous mathematical foundation for PDE-based thickness, demonstrating its reliability as a tool in shape analysis and topology optimization for general curved geometries.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical analysis of an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) designed to compute the geometric thickness of a given shape. The PDE-based formulation provides a direct and systematic approach to evaluate thickness through the elliptic equation, whose solution yields a vector field from which the thickness is extracted as the divergence. While the convergence of this PDE-based thickness to the geometric thickness had been rigorously justified only for simple geometries such as intervals and straight bands, its validity for more general shapes remained open. In this work, we extend the analysis to annular domains, where curvature effects are nontrivial. We prove that the PDE-based thickness converges to the geometric thickness as the diffusion parameter tends to zero by estimating the difference between two notions of thickness with the square root of the diffusion parameter. Explicit expressions involving modified Bessel functions are obtained for annuli, together with sharp inequalities for their ratios. These results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the PDE-based thickness and demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool in shape analysis and topology optimization.

Method: The authors investigate Harnack estimates for weak solutions to nonlocal equations involving fractional Laplacian operators, divergence-free vector fields in critical/supercritical regimes, and distributional forcing terms in fractional Sobolev spaces.

Result: The paper obtains analytical results for Harnack estimates and applies them to prove well-posedness of critical stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations, existence of weak solutions to 2D fractional Navier-Stokes equations with measure-valued initial data, and well-posedness of generalized martingale problems.

Conclusion: The developed Harnack estimates provide powerful analytical tools that enable rigorous treatment of various critical stochastic PDEs and fluid dynamics problems with nonlocal operators and irregular data.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Harnack estimates for weak solutions to the following nonlocal equation: $$ \partial_t u = Δ^{α/2} u + b \cdot \nabla u + f, $$ where $Δ^{α/2}$ denotes the fractional Laplacian, $b$ is a divergence-free vector field in a critical or supercritical regularity regime, and $f$ is a distribution in a fractional Sobolev space with negative indices. As applications of the analytical results obtained in this paper, we establish the well-posedness of critical stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations driven by additive Brownian noise, prove the existence of weak solutions to the two-dimensional fractional Navier--Stokes equations with measure-valued initial vorticity, and demonstrate the well-posedness of generalized martingale problems associated with critical stochastic differential equations.

Result: Applied to compressible flow around elastic wing membrane and classical cylinder with hyper-elastic bar benchmark; results compared favorably with literature.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides accurate fluid-structure interaction simulations with exact displacement transfer across different discretizations.

Abstract: A mixed continuous / discontinuous Galerkin scheme is introduced for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction problems in an isogeometric analysis framework. The properties of Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline basis functions are leveraged to enable an exact transfer of the structural displacement to the fluid domain, while using different discretizations and refinements on the two sides of the coupling interface. The proposed approach is applied to the simulation of a compressible flow around an elastic wing membrane and to a classical fluid-structure benchmark involving the flow around a cylinder equipped with a hyper-elastic bar. For both cases, the results obtained are compared to those found in the literature to assess the accuracy of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper proves that the Morse decomposition of the global attractor for the Chafee-Infante problem remains robust under non-local perturbations of the diffusion term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the Morse structure of dynamical systems persists when subjected to non-local perturbations, specifically for the Chafee-Infante problem.

Method: Analyzing the robustness of Morse decomposition by considering non-local perturbations of the diffusion term, requiring the non-local function to remain close to a positive constant.

Result: The Morse structure of the local limit problem is preserved under such non-local perturbations.

Conclusion: The Morse decomposition for the Chafee-Infante problem's global attractor is robust with respect to non-local perturbations when the perturbing function stays near a positive constant.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the robustness of the Morse decomposition for the global attractor of the Chafee-Infante problem with respect to non-local perturbations. Focusing on a non-local perturbation of the diffusion term, we establish that the Morse structure of the local limit problem is preserved as long as the non-local function multiplying the laplacian operator remains close to a positive constant.

TL;DR: Analysis of Tollmien-Schlichting wave dispersion relation in shear flows for small viscosity Navier-Stokes equations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simple presentation and study mathematical properties of the dispersion relation for Tollmien-Schlichting waves in shear flows

Method: Study of dispersion relation properties for shear flows in strips or half planes with small viscosity

Result: Characterization of instability conditions where horizontal wave number lies between lower and upper marginal stability curves

Conclusion: Simple presentation of Tollmien-Schlichting wave dispersion relation and its mathematical properties for small viscosity shear flows

Abstract: It is well-known that shear flows in a strip or in the half plane are unstable for the Navier-Stokes equations if the viscosity $ν$ is small enough, provided the horizontal wave number $α$ lies in a small interval, between the so called lower and upper marginal stability curves. The corresponding instabilities are called Tollmien-Schlichting waves. In this letter, we give a simple presentation of the dispersion relation of these waves and study its mathematical properties.

*Bogi Kim,Jehan Oh*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes gradient higher integrability results for weak solutions to degenerate parabolic double phase equations, with different gap conditions for bounded solutions versus solutions with certain continuity properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the regularity properties of solutions to degenerate parabolic equations of double phase type, which combine p-growth and q-growth terms with a coefficient function, and to determine the precise gap conditions needed for higher integrability.

Method: Mathematical analysis of weak solutions to the degenerate parabolic double phase equation using techniques from partial differential equations and regularity theory, establishing gradient higher integrability under specific gap conditions between p and q.

Result: For bounded solutions, gradient higher integrability holds when q ≤ p + α. For solutions with continuity in time and L^s integrability in space, the condition is q ≤ p + sα/(n+s). These provide an interpolation between gap bounds in the parabolic double phase setting.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes precise gap conditions for gradient higher integrability in degenerate parabolic double phase equations, showing different thresholds for bounded solutions versus solutions with specific continuity properties, providing a complete interpolation framework.

Abstract: We establish gradient higher integrability results for weak solutions to degenerate parabolic equations of double phase type $$ u_t-\operatorname{div} \left(|Du|^{p-2}Du + a(x,t)|Du|^{q-2}Du\right)=0 $$ in $Ω_T := Ω\times (0,T)$, where $a(\cdot)\in C^{α,\fracα{2}}(Ω_T)$. For bounded solutions, we prove that the result holds under the gap condition $$ q \leq p + α. $$ Moreover, for solutions with $$ u\in C(0,T;L^s(Ω)), \quad s \geq 2, $$ we obtain higher integrability under the gap condition $$ q \leq p + \frac{sα}{n+s}. $$ These results provide an interpolation between the gap bounds in the parabolic double phase setting.

### [56] [A sharp commutator estimate for all Riesz modulated energies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13461)
*Elias Hess-Childs,Matthew Rosenzweig,Sylvia Serfaty*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves an optimal functional inequality controlling the derivative of Riesz modulated energy during transport, achieving the sharp N^(s/d-1) error rate for all Riesz potentials including sub-Coulomb cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work had non-optimal additive N-dependent errors in functional inequalities for Riesz modulated energy, which is essential for studying mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases.

Method: Uses a new potential truncation scheme based on wavelet-type representation of Riesz potential to handle singularity, reducing proof to averaging over Kato-Ponce type estimates via commutator analysis.

Result: Obtained optimal N^(s/d-1) error rate for all cases including sub-Coulomb, and showed expected convergence rates for mean-field limits of Hamiltonian and gradient flows when s < d-2.

Conclusion: Resolves the entire potential Riesz case by complementing recent work on super-Coulomb case, with applications to sharp convergence rates for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for Coulomb/Riesz gases.

Abstract: We prove a functional inequality in any dimension controlling the derivative along a transport of the Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.
  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\mathsf{s}<\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\mathsf{d}-2\le \mathsf{s}<\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case.

*Faiq Raees,Jie Liu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Study of singularity formation in 1D nonlinear wave models with quadratic time-derivative nonlinearities, constructing generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that capture observed dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations, particularly comparing models that violate the null condition versus Lorentz-invariant null-form models.

Method: Construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions, proving no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, and establish asymptotic stability for relevant branches.

Result: Found that generalized self-similar solutions with logarithmic growth provide correct blow-up description inside backward light cones, capturing both ODE-type blow-up in both models.

Conclusion: Provides a coherent and unified picture of blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations through generalized self-similar solutions.

Abstract: We study singularity formation in two one-dimensional nonlinear wave models with quadratic time-derivative nonlinearities. The non-null model violates the null condition and typically develops finite-time blow-up; the null-form model is Lorentz-invariant and enjoys small-data global existence, yet still admits blow-up for large data. Building on our earlier work on spatial-derivative nonlinearities, we construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that captures the observed dynamics. We prove that no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, while the generalized self-similar solutions -exhibiting logarithmic growth- provide the correct blow-up description inside backward light cones. We further establish asymptotic stability for the relevant branches, including the ODE-type blow-up in both models. These results yield a coherent and unified picture of blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations.

*Nailya Manatova*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence of solutions to quintic gKdV equation that blow up in finite time with rate (T-t)^{-ν} for ν ∈ (1/2,1), constructed near solitons and corresponding to soliton concentration at infinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous results on exotic blow-up for the quintic gKdV equation beyond the technical restriction ν > 11/13, covering all ν > 1/2 and treating the critical case ν = 1/2 separately.

Method: Modified virial-energy functional approach to allow all ν > 1/2 and simplify energy estimates, constructing solutions arbitrarily close to solitons that concentrate at spatial infinity.

Result: Proved existence of energy space solutions that blow up with rate ‖∂ₓu(t)‖₂ ∼ (T-t)^{-ν} for ν ∈ (1/2,1), corresponding to infinite point blow-up via soliton concentration.

Conclusion: Successfully extended exotic blow-up results for quintic gKdV to all ν > 1/2 using modified virial-energy functional, complementing previous work and leaving ν = 1/2 as critical case for future study.

Abstract: For the quintic, mass critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, for any $ν\in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, we prove the existence of solutions in the energy space that blow up in finite time $T>0$ with the blow-up rate $\|\partial_x u(t)\|_{L^2} \sim (T-t)^{-ν}$ (infinite point blow-up). These solutions are constructed arbitrarily close to the family of solitons and correspond to the concentration of a soliton traveling at $+\infty$ in space as $t\uparrow T$. This complements the previous results obtained in the work of Martel, Merle, Raphaël in 2015 on infinite point exotic blow-up, which were valid under the technical restriction $ν>\frac {11}{13}$. The value $ν=\frac 12$ corresponds to a critical case to be treated elsewhere. At the technical level, we implement a modification of the virial-energy functional, to allow all $ν> \frac 12$ and simplify the proof of energy estimates.

Result: Successfully extended Treves' characterization of hypoellipticity for analytic operators of principal type to the ultradifferentiable category, showing that the operators behave well in ultradifferentiable classes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that analytic pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators are compatible with ultradifferentiable classes, and provides an extension of important hypoellipticity results to this broader functional framework.

Abstract: We show that analytic pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators behave well for ultradifferentiable classes satisfying minimal regularity properties. As an application we investigate the ultradifferentiable regularity properties of several examples of analytic differential operators. In particular we extend Treves' characterization of the hypoellipticity of analytic operators of principal type to the ultradifferentiable category.

*Mengyi Chen,Pengru Huang,Kostya S. Novoselov,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A framework for learning macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic systems using only small-system simulations, employing partial evolution and hierarchical upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct simulation of large microscopic systems for macroscopic modeling is computationally prohibitive; machine learning offers an alternative but faces challenges with spatially extended systems.

Method: Uses partial evolution scheme to generate training data from local patches, identifies closure variables for macroscopic observables, learns dynamics with custom loss, and employs hierarchical upsampling for large-system snapshot generation.

Result: Demonstrated accuracy and robustness across various stochastic spatially extended systems including SPDEs, lattice spin systems, and NbMoTa alloy system.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables learning of macroscopic dynamics from small-system simulations, overcoming computational limitations of large-system direct simulation.

Abstract: Macroscopic dynamical descriptions of complex physical systems are crucial for understanding and controlling material behavior. With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system.

TL;DR: Combining two-color laser fields with mechanical strain enables precise control over high-harmonic generation in monolayer WS2, providing orthogonal manipulation of harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control over high-harmonic emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways in 2D materials remains challenging.

Method: First-principles simulations combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering in monolayer WS2.

Result: Two-color field phase provides sub-femtosecond switch for quantum coherence, while tensile strain amplifies harmonic yield through enhanced intraband current and Berry curvature effects, showing linear strain dependence and amplified perpendicular polarization.

Conclusion: This establishes a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and provides an all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties, positioning WS2 as a model system for attosecond physics.

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable gradient-based optimization in nuclear fusion simulations by integrating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll into differentiable workflows.

Method: Uses JAX auto-differentiable ODE solver for pulsed power circuit and plasma parameters, with Tesseract providing a differentiable abstraction layer to incorporate Gkeyll plasma simulations via gradient-based Newton iteration.

Result: Achieved end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers, neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid prototyping.

Conclusion: Tesseract successfully bridges the gap between differentiable programming frameworks and non-differentiable production solvers, enabling progressive prototyping in multiphysics fusion simulations.

Abstract: This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.

Motivation: Climate change progress is too slow, so more radical technologies like stratospheric aerosol injection are being considered to limit climate change.

Method: Methodology for evaluating effects of injecting 20Mt of SO2 annually on global radiative balance, photovoltaic potentials, and renewable energy systems.

Result: Average annual PV potential reductions range from 0.25% to 4%, up to 12% in Northern Europe during summer. Renewable energy systems largely absorb these reductions with minor capacity shifts.

Conclusion: Large-scale renewable energy systems' inherent flexibility helps mitigate cost changes, but understanding this flexibility is crucial to avoid design errors.

Abstract: Climate change is one of the 21st centurys major challenges. However, the progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is perceived as being too slow. Hence, more radical technologies such as stratospheric aerosol injection are entering discussions to limit climate change. This study presents a methodology for evaluating the effects of injecting 20Mt of SO$_2$ into the atmosphere annually on the global radiative balance, photovoltaic potentials, and renewable energy systems under a targeted temperature reduction of 2°C. Results show that the average annual reduction of PV potentials ranges from 0.25% to 4% up to 12% in Northern Europe during summer. The modeled renewable energy systems largely absorb these reductions resulting in minor capacity shifts with larger changes confined to a few systems. The results show that the inherent flexibility of large scale renewable energy systems helps mitigating changes in cost, but understanding this flexibility is crucial to avoid errors in design.

Motivation: To develop rapid surrogate models for energetic particle confinement optimization in tokamak fusion devices, overcoming computational challenges from large time scale separations.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) solving inhomogeneous adjoint of drift kinetic equation with Lorentz collision operator in axisymmetric geometry.

Result: PINN successfully learned escape times for majority of geometry, demonstrating capability to handle rapid transit time vs slow collision time scale separation.

Conclusion: Carefully designed PINNs provide viable path toward rapid surrogate models for broader optimization frameworks in fusion energy research.

Abstract: An adjoint formulation of energetic particle confinement in axisymmetric geometry is derived and evaluated using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The PINN estimates the escape time of energetic ions by solving an inhomogeneous adjoint of the drift kinetic equation with a Lorentz collision operator, yielding predictions of the escape time of fast ions in tokamak geometry due to direct ion orbit loss and collisional transport. This is the first time a PINN has been used to solve the drift kinetic equation in tokamak geometry, a challenging problem due to the large time scale separation present between the rapid transit time of energetic ions, and their slow collision time scale. It is shown that a careful and intentional design of a PINN is able to learn the escape time for the majority of the geometry considered, suggesting a path toward constructing a rapid surrogate for use in a broader optimization framework.

Motivation: To investigate the effects of PAW produced by different plasma systems on lettuce growth and development parameters.

Method: Used three plasma systems (transient spark, fountain dielectric barrier discharge, microwave plasma) to generate PAW, measured physiochemical properties and RONS concentrations, conducted 8-day seed germination tests and 6-week plant growth experiments measuring various growth parameters.

Result: PAW enhanced plant development and affected physiological parameters, with effects dependent on the specific RONS contents in the PAW.

Conclusion: PAW can be used to enhance plant growth and development, with its effectiveness determined by the specific reactive oxygen and nitrogen species concentrations produced by different plasma systems.

Abstract: Cold air plasma typically generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which are transported into water to produce plasma-activated water (PAW). This study examines the effect of PAW produced by three different plasma systems on lettuce: transient spark, fountain dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave plasma. Physiochemical PAW properties and concentrations of RONS (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitrite, and nitrate) were measured. Seed germination parameters were recorded in 8-day paper tests. The effect of PAW irrigation was investigated after 6 weeks of plant growth in the soil by measuring the germination rate, plant and root length, dry and fresh plant weight, number of leaves, and photosynthetic pigments. PAW, dependent upon its RONS contents, enhances plant development and affects its physiological parameters.

Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~μ$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.

Conclusion: The method extends ray-tracing framework and provides a more reliable tool for wave heating simulations in magnetized plasmas.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust numerical method for calculating the total absorption rate of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas, capable of determining the absorption ratio among different plasma components. The method adopts Ronnmark's expressions for the plasma dispersion function, $Z(ζ)$, and the dielectric tensor, K, to overcome the convergence issues and computational inefficiency of the traditional Bessel function summation approach for evaluating the hot plasma dispersion relation, D, particularly at large $k_\perp$. It has been implemented and validated across multiple frequency regimes, including ion cyclotron (ICRF), lower hybrid (LHRF), and electron cyclotron (ECRF) ranges of frequencies, with results benchmarked against conventional $Z(ζ)$ and Bessel function expansions. Integrated into the BORAY ray-tracing code, the method uses expressions derived from the anti-Hermitian part of the dielectric tensor to compute absorption ratios. This work extends the ray-tracing framework, providing a more reliable tool for wave heating simulations.

Motivation: To generalize Contreras' work on Tonelli Lagrangians from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to infinite-dimensional contexts, specifically half-Lie groups like diffeomorphism groups, and extend Bauer-Harms-Michor's results from geodesic flows to Euler-Lagrange flows.

Method: Introduces Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics, defines three Mañé critical energy thresholds, and proves global existence of Euler-Lagrange flow under mild regularity and completeness assumptions.

Result: Shows that any two points in half-Lie groups can be connected by global Tonelli minimizers above the lowest energy threshold, and such minimizers are flow lines of Euler-Lagrange flow under additional Lagrangian assumptions.

Conclusion: Establishes global well-posedness of Euler-Poincaré equations for Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups, providing a comprehensive extension of finite-dimensional results to infinite-dimensional settings.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with a strong right-invariant Riemannian metric. These are right-invariant Lagrangians defined on the tangent bundle of a half-Lie group with quadratic growth on each fiber. The main examples of half-Lie groups are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. We show that the Euler--Lagrange flow exists globally. We then introduce three thresholds of the energy, called the Ma~ne critical values, and prove that under mild regularity and completeness assumptions on the half-Lie group, any two points can be connected by a global Tonelli minimizer above the lowest of these energy thresholds. Under an additional assumption on the Lagrangian, such a minimizer is a flow line of the Euler--Lagrange flow. This extends the work of Contreras from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to the infinite-dimensional context. Moreover, our results also extend the recent work of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to Euler--Lagrange flows of Tonelli Lagrangians. As an application, we obtain global well-posedness of all Euler--Poincare'e equations associated with Tonelli Lagrangians on half-Lie groups equipped with strong right-invariant Riemannian metrics.

TL;DR: The paper provides conditions for positive (1,1)-currents to induce metric structures that are Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kähler manifolds, and extends Kähler-Ricci flow results to Alexandrov surfaces in dimension 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when positive (1,1)-currents on compact Kähler manifolds can generate metric structures that approximate smooth Kähler manifolds, and to extend Kähler-Ricci flow theory to singular surfaces.

Method: Develop sufficient conditions for positive (1,1)-currents to induce Gromov-Hausdorff convergent metric structures, and apply Kähler-Ricci flow techniques to Alexandrov surfaces with bounded integral curvature.

Result: Established conditions under which (1,1)-currents produce metric limits of Kähler manifolds, and proved that oriented compact Alexandrov surfaces without cusps can initiate Kähler-Ricci flows.

Conclusion: The work connects singular metric structures with smooth Kähler geometry through Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and extends the applicability of Kähler-Ricci flows to broader classes of surfaces.

Abstract: Given a compact Kähler manifold $X$ and a closed, positive $(1,1)$-current $T$ on $X$, we find sufficient conditions for $T$ to induce a metric structure $(X,d_T)$ which is the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of compact Kähler manifolds either in a "static" way or at time zero of smooth Kähler-Ricci flows. In dimension $1$ we extend works of T. Richard and M. Simon, showing that any oriented compact Alexandrov surface with bounded integral curvature and without cusp is the initial datum of a Kähler-Ricci flow.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust separation in constrained airspace for Urban Air Mobility operations, particularly as traffic densities increase.

Method: Pairwise Conflict Avoidance based on delayed departures using kinematic principles, expanded to multi-agent scenarios through optimization that systematically determines departure times.

Result: Significant reduction in total delay while ensuring collision-free operations, demonstrated through numerical simulations across diverse multi-agent environments and real-world UAM use cases.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable framework for emerging urban air mobility systems, effectively managing increasing traffic densities while maintaining safety.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conflict-free multi- agent flight scheduling that ensures robust separation in con- strained airspace for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations application. First, we introduce Pairwise Conflict Avoidance (PCA) based on delayed departures, leveraging kinematic principles to maintain safe distances. Next, we expand PCA to multi-agent scenarios, formulating an optimization approach that systematically determines departure times under increasing traffic densities. Performance metrics, such as average delay, assess the effectiveness of our solution. Through numerical simulations across diverse multi-agent environments and real- world UAM use cases, our method demonstrates a significant reduction in total delay while ensuring collision-free operations. This approach provides a scalable framework for emerging urban air mobility systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand localization phenomena in quantum stochastic mechanics, particularly how scattering centers affect wavefunction localization and how this relates to physical systems like particles in Bose-Einstein condensates.

Method: Used the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers, analyzed static localization in 1D square wells with Dirac delta scattering centers, studied both fixed and pseudo-random positions with uniform distribution, and examined dynamics and affine quantization versions.

Result: Demonstrated increasing localization of ground state wavefunction with increasing coupling strength g, and further localization enhancement when averaging over many random scattering center positions. The affine quantization version reduces to contiguous square wells with arbitrary wall positions independent of g.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into localization mechanisms in quantum stochastic systems, showing how scattering centers and their random distributions enhance localization, with potential applications to understanding particles in Bose-Einstein condensates and related quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for finding optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles, which is a complex combinatorial optimization problem.

Method: Reinforcement learning with geometric graph representation of nanoparticles, using composition-conserving atomic swap actions on icosahedral structures.

Result: Agent discovers established ground state structures, works robustly across different initial orderings, and can extrapolate to unseen nanoparticle sizes, though limited with multiple alloying elements.

Conclusion: RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can effectively navigate nanoparticle ordering spaces and offers transferable optimization that reduces repeated search costs.

Abstract: We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discretisation methods struggle to balance mesh flexibility with strict conservation fidelity, limiting their effectiveness in complex interfacial systems with multiphysics interactions.

Method: Developed a 3D EbFVM with advanced discretisation techniques for unstructured meshes, including parametric shape functions, robust flux integration schemes, and curvilinear coordinate mappings.

Result: The framework successfully captures intricate transport phenomena, strong field couplings, and scale disparities across geometrically complex domains in lubrication-driven benchmark problems.

Conclusion: The 3D EbFVM provides a versatile and generalisable tool for accurate modeling of transport phenomena in geometrically and physically challenging multiphysics applications.

Abstract: Accurately depicting multiphysics interactions in interfacial systems requires computational frameworks capable of reconciling geometric adaptability with strict conservation fidelity. However, traditional spatiotemporal discretisation methods often compromise between mesh flexibility and flow conservation enforcement, hence constraining their effectiveness in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, we respond to these computational demands by developing a novel three-dimensional adaptation of the Element-based Finite Volume Method (EbFVM) -- a hybrid numerical strategy that merges the geometric flexibility of Finite Element Methods with the conservation-centric principles of Finite Volume Methods. The proposed framework introduces advanced discretisation techniques tailored to unstructured, irregular mesh entities, including detailed parametric shape functions, robust flux integration schemes and rigorous body-fitted curvilinear coordinate mappings. Through a series of lubrication-driven benchmark problems, we demonstrate the EbFVM's capacity to capture intricate transport phenomena, strong field couplings and scale disparities across geometrically complex domains. By enabling accurate modelling in geometrically and physically challenging interfacial systems, the three-dimensional EbFVM offers a versatile and generalisable tool for simulating transport phenomena in a plethora of multiphysics applications.

TL;DR: Quantum skyrmionic qubits using DMI-stabilized spin states show promise for quantum computation but suffer from DMI-induced decoherence during gate operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states that exploit quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, departing from classical deterministic computing.

Method: Proposed skyrmionic qubit framework using DMI-stabilized states in 2D spin lattices with competing interactions, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic and open boundary conditions. Implemented quantum gates and analyzed energy density and entanglement entropy.

Result: Quantum skyrmionic phase emerges under PBC while OBC favor classical-like skyrmions. Quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, while classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation demonstrated.

Conclusion: Skyrmionic states are promising qubit candidates, but DMI plays a dual role - stabilizing qubits while inducing decoherence during gate operations.

Abstract: Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.

Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks of classical PDE solving methods by leveraging quantum computing principles for acceleration and developing efficient uncertainty quantification.

Method: Use quantum algorithm with Hamming weight-preserving circuits and unary basis encoding to accelerate matrix multiplication. Apply quantum orthogonal circuits to eliminate spectral normalization in uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieved significant computational complexity improvement (O(d log d/ε²) vs O(d²)). Successfully solved forward and inverse PDE problems. Developed first UQ method specifically for Separable PINNs.

Conclusion: QO-SPINNs provide an efficient quantum-enhanced framework for PDE solving with robust uncertainty quantification, validated through numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum Orthogonal Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QO-SPINNs), a novel architecture for solving Partial Differential Equations, integrating quantum computing principles to address the computational bottlenecks of classical methods. We leverage a quantum algorithm for accelerating matrix multiplication within each layer, achieving a $\mathcal O(d\log d/ε^2)$ complexity, a significant improvement over the classical $\mathcal O(d^2)$ complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of the matrix, $ε$ the accuracy level. This is accomplished by using a Hamming weight-preserving quantum circuit and a unary basis for data encoding, with a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the overall architecture provided. We demonstrate the practical utility of our model by applying it to solve both forward and inverse PDE problems. Furthermore, we exploit the inherent orthogonality of our quantum circuits (which guarantees a spectral norm of 1) to develop a novel uncertainty quantification method. Our approach adapts the Spectral Normalized Gaussian Process for SPINNs, eliminating the need for the computationally expensive spectral normalization step. By using a Quantum Orthogonal SPINN architecture based on stacking, we provide a robust and efficient framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) which, to our knowledge, is the first UQ method specifically designed for Separable PINNs. Numerical results based on classical simulation of the quantum circuits, are presented to validate the theoretical claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for complex fermionic systems is challenging due to the need to capture time-evolving many-body correlations and the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions, which complicates their representation.

Method: The approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem using a neural network framework that treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting parallelizable training.

Result: The method achieves excellent agreement with reference solutions across four benchmark problems: 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and laser-driven H2 molecule, demonstrating scalability, accuracy, and flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

Abstract: The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty in constructing accurate and transferable coarse-grained models efficiently, particularly for Martini 3 which has expanded chemical resolution but complicates organic molecule mapping due to context-dependent rules and lack of standardized procedures.

Method: Combines curated bead dictionary with hierarchical rule-based algorithm to automatically generate Martini 3 models from SMILES strings, capable of mapping large molecules up to 126 heavy atoms.

Result: Generated Martini 3 models for over 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. Benchmarking of 1,081 structures showed strong agreement with experimental octanol-water free-energy and partition-coefficient values.

Conclusion: The framework enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations in drug discovery and materials design, overcoming limitations of existing automated approaches.

Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($ΔG_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.

TL;DR: First detection of HNC isomer in low-temperature plasmas with [HNC]/[HCN] ratio ~10^-4, much lower than interstellar values due to different kinetics involving vibrationally hot intermediates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HNC isomer remains unexplored in molecular plasmas despite HCN being well-known in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments.

Method: Used quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy to detect and quantify HNC and HCN in low-temperature plasmas from N2/H2/CH4 mixtures, confirmed with molecular spectroscopic databases.

Result: Observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of ~10^-4, far lower than interstellar media where ratios can reach unity.

Conclusion: HNC plays an overlooked role in plasma chemistry with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.

Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a well-known product in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments, but its isomer, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), remains unexplored in molecular plasmas. Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a resource-efficient method for reducing the restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size while maintaining accuracy, especially for large systems requiring extended basis sets.

Method: ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme that outperforms traditional orbital energy-based truncation, tested on H2O2, O2, CH2, and Ir(ppy)3 complex using CASCI and iQCC methods.

Result: ZAPT-FNO provides systematic convergence of correlation energies and singlet-triplet energy gaps, enabling accurate T1-S0 gap calculations in large systems like Ir(ppy)3 with 260 electrons approaching experimental values.

Conclusion: ZAPT-FNO method is promising for improving quantum chemical modeling accuracy efficiently, enabling simulation of open-shell states in large materials with realistic active space sizes without compromising basis-set quality.

Abstract: We present an open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, which utilizes the second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2), to reduce the restricted opten-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size with controllable accuracy. Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.

Motivation: Addresses the challenge of designing functionally graded materials for complex-shaped domains where traditional methods struggle with arbitrary geometries and smooth profile generation.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process Regression to generate smooth FGM volume fraction profiles that respect boundary conditions, coupled with a modified genetic algorithm (using projection operators instead of standard crossover) for optimization.

Result: The algorithm successfully handles complex-shaped domains, generates diverse FGM profiles, and demonstrates efficacy through numerous thermoelastic optimization examples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective approach for FGM design on arbitrary geometries, offering control over profile smoothness and design space size through tunable parameters.

Abstract: This manuscript addresses the challenge of designing functionally graded materials (FGMs) for arbitrary-shaped domains. Towards this goal, the present work proposes a generic volume fraction profile generation algorithm based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The proposed algorithm can handle complex-shaped domains and generate smooth FGM profiles while adhering to the specified volume fraction values at boundaries/part of boundaries. The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator. We present numerous thermoelastic optimization examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed profile generation algorithm and optimization framework.

Method: Developed two PINN approaches: adaptive with self-adaptive loss weighting and conservative enforcing explicit conservation laws. Tested on three benchmark problems: single soliton propagation, two-soliton interaction, and undular bore evolution.

Result: Results within O(10^-5) of established numerical solutions. Adaptive PINN significantly better for complex nonlinear interactions, conservative PINN better for long-term behavior. Conservation enforcement can be harmful for highly nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: PINN effectiveness is problem-specific. Conservation enforcement doesn't always improve performance and may require special training methods for nonlinear systems. PINNs can provide accurate mesh-free solutions to complex PDEs.

Abstract: Standard physics-informed neural network implementations have produced large error rates when using these models to solve the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symmetric deep neural networks can approximate symmetric Korobov functions with convergence rates that scale polynomially with dimension, avoiding the curse of dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the curse of dimensionality in approximating symmetric functions using neural networks, particularly for functions with permutation symmetry.

Method: Construct symmetric deep neural networks specifically designed to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove theoretical convergence bounds.

Result: Both convergence rate and constant prefactor scale polynomially with ambient dimension, significantly improving over previous methods that suffered from exponential scaling.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient approximation and learning of symmetric functions without the curse of dimensionality, with generalization-error rates that also avoid exponential scaling.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely used as universal approximators for functions with inherent physical structures, including permutation symmetry. In this paper, we construct symmetric deep neural networks to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove that both the convergence rate and the constant prefactor scale at most polynomially with respect to the ambient dimension. This represents a substantial improvement over prior approximation guarantees that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Building on these approximation bounds, we further derive a generalization-error rate for learning symmetric Korobov functions whose leading factors likewise avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: MDIntrinsicDimension is a Python package that estimates intrinsic dimension from molecular dynamics trajectories using rotation- and translation-invariant projections and state-of-the-art estimators, providing three analysis modes and both overall and time-resolved ID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations generate high-dimensional trajectories, and estimating the minimal number of variables (intrinsic dimension) needed to describe conformational changes provides atomistic insights into biomolecular structure, dynamics, and function.

Method: The package combines rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators, offering three analysis modes: whole-molecule ID, sliding windows along sequence, and per-secondary-structure elements.

Result: Applied to fast folding-unfolding trajectories from DESRES dataset, the method shows that intrinsic dimension complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments.

Conclusion: MDIntrinsicDimension provides a valuable tool for analyzing MD trajectories by estimating intrinsic dimension, revealing conformational heterogeneity and transitions that complement traditional geometric analysis methods.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insights into the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules by generating time-resolved, high-dimensional trajectories. Analyzing such data benefits from estimating the minimal number of variables required to describe the explored conformational manifold, known as the intrinsic dimension (ID). We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time. We illustrate the approach on fast folding-unfolding trajectories from the DESRES dataset, demonstrating that ID complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A two-level fluid-kinetic coupling method combining DSMC for near-wall treatment and HOLB for bulk flow simulation, enabling simulation of wall-bounded flows up to Re~1000 with accurate near-wall instability capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable simulation of wall-bounded turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers by combining the strengths of kinetic and fluid solvers, overcoming computational limitations of using either method alone.

Method: Two-level coupling procedure: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) for kinetic treatment of near-wall layer, and high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as fluid solver in bulk flow.

Result: Validated on plane Poiseuille and Couette flows at finite Knudsen numbers; preliminary evidence shows regeneration cycles of coherent structures above critical Reynolds number, which was previously unattainable by either solver separately.

Conclusion: The DSMC-HOLB coupling provides a computationally feasible approach for simulating wall-bounded turbulent flows and may enable new insights into wall micro-corrugations' role in triggering transition to turbulence.

Abstract: We present a two-level (fluid-kinetic) coupling procedure for the simulation of wall-bounded flows at Reynolds numbers up to thousands. The method combines a kinetic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) treatment of the near-wall layer, with a high-order Lattice-Boltzmann (HOLB) scheme as a fluid solver in the bulk flow. Given the kinetic nature of HOLB, this coupling is expected to provide a physically accurate treatment of the near-wall instabilities which trigger the transition to turbulence above a critical threshold around $Re_c \sim 750$.
  The coupled DSMC-HOLB solver is validated by simulating plane Poiseuille and Couette flows far from equilibrium, i.e at finite Knudsen number regimes. Based on this validation, we provide the first preliminary evidence that the combination of HOLB and DSMC permits to observe the regeneration cycles of coherent structures which arise above a critical value of the Reynolds number. This task would be hardly attainable by either of the two solvers separately; while DSMC can capture strong near-wall non-equilibrium effects, it lacks the compute power to deal with both near-wall and bulk flow at the same time. We look to HOLB to make it computationally feasible to perform such a simulation. The present two-level coupling procedure may pave the way to a new generation of fluid-kinetic simulations of wall-bounded turbulent flows, thus helping to gain deeper insights into the role of wall micro-corrugations in triggering the dynamic instabilities that drive the transition to turbulent regimes.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Modal OWNS (M-OWNS) method combines modal ansatz with non-modal parabolisation for efficient analysis of disturbance development in boundary layers, overcoming PSE step-size limitations while maintaining stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more robust and computationally efficient method for investigating disturbance development in boundary layers that overcomes the limitations of conventional PSE and non-modal OWNS frameworks.

Method: Combines modal ansatz from parabolised stability equations (PSE) with recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy from non-modal OWNS to stabilize streamwise-marching modal algorithm.

Result: M-OWNS permits arbitrarily small streamwise step-sizes while maintaining stability, captures fine-scale baseflow variations, and is more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS while recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.

Conclusion: Modal OWNS framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over conventional methods while retaining capability to capture both modal and non-modal disturbance development.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to solve the modal form of the linearised one-way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations for investigating disturbance development in developing subsonic and supersonic boundary layers. The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.

### [90] [A stochastic flow approach to De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates for SPDEs with smooth transport noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12692)
*Antonio Agresti,Max Sauerbrey,Mark Veraar*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper resolves the open problem of Hölder continuity for parabolic SPDEs with transport noise by transforming them into random PDEs using stochastic flows, establishing new estimates for flow inverses and developing a novel Itô-Wentzell formula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hölder continuity remained a key open problem in the regularity theory of parabolic SPDEs with transport noise, even though boundedness had been established. The classical De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory ensures Hölder continuity for deterministic elliptic/parabolic PDEs, but extending this to stochastic settings was unresolved.

Method: Uses Kunita's stochastic method of characteristics to transform SPDEs into random PDEs via stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms. Develops new a-priori estimates for inverse stochastic flows and a novel Itô-Wentzell formula adapted to rough random fields.

Result: Establishes Hölder continuity for solutions to parabolic SPDEs with transport noise when noise coefficients are sufficiently regular in space. Proves existence of global, regular solutions to quasilinear SPDEs with transport noise.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser regularity theory to parabolic SPDEs with transport noise, resolving a major open problem and providing new tools for analyzing stochastic partial differential equations.

Abstract: The celebrated De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory ensures that solutions to uniformly elliptic or parabolic PDEs are bounded and Hölder continuous, even with merely bounded measurable coefficients. For parabolic SPDEs with transport noise, boundedness has recently been established, but Hölder continuity remains a key open problem in the regularity theory of parabolic SPDEs. In this work, we resolve this question under the assumption that the noise coefficients are sufficiently regular in space. Our approach relies on Kunita's stochastic method of characteristics, which allows us to transform the original SPDE-via a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms-into a random PDE to which the classical De Giorgi-Nash-Moser estimates apply. This program is accomplished through new a-priori estimates for the inverse of stochastic flows of diffeomorphisms, and a novel version of the Itô-Wentzell formula adapted to rough random fields. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, we establish the existence of global, regular solutions to quasilinear SPDEs with transport noise.

*Hadi Madanian,Terry Z. Liu*

TL;DR: Analysis of ion distribution evolution during quasi-parallel shock reformation using Earth's bow shock observations, showing how foreshock structures create new shock layers through cross-field current imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how collisionless shocks in space plasmas mediate energy exchange between particles and fields, specifically analyzing the reformation cycle of quasi-parallel shocks.

Method: Used multi-point in-situ observations in Earth's foreshock region to study transient foreshock structures as they generate new shocks.

Result: Found that backstreaming ions create cavitons that change shock geometry, leading to cross-field current imbalances that nonlinearly grow new shock layers within 4.5-11.2 ion inertial lengths from main bow shock.

Conclusion: Plasma compression at new shock layers occurs through compactification of cold upstream ion beams by electrostatic fields, eventually expanding to form new sheaths during shock reformation.

Abstract: Collisionless shocks in space and astrophysical plasmas mediate energy exchange between charged particles and fields in two or more plasma flows. In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock. We find that plasma compression at the new thin shock layer is due to compactification of the cold upstream ion beam by high amplitude magnetic field-aligned electrostatic fields. At later stages, the plasma compression expands to form a new sheath.
