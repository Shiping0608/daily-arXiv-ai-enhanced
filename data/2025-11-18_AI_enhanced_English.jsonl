The modal framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over the conventional non-modal OWNS framework. Notably, we demonstrate that modal OWNS (M-OWNS) retains the capability to capture non-modal disturbance development. Our technique leverages the modal ansatz of parabolised stability equations (PSE) whilst employing the recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy of non-modal OWNS to stabilise the streamwise-marching modal algorithm. A key contribution is that we overcome the minimum streamwise step-size requirement that constrains conventional PSE in capturing short-scale disturbance evolution. We demonstrate through canonical test cases that fine-scale variations in the baseflow can be captured effectively. The M-OWNS procedure permits arbitrarily small streamwisemarching step-sizes whilst maintaining stability. Crucially, we find the algorithm to be more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS, whilst recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "Modal OWNS (M-OWNS) method combines modal ansatz with non-modal parabolisation for efficient analysis of disturbance development in boundary layers, overcoming PSE step-size limitations while maintaining stability.", "motivation": "To develop a more robust and computationally efficient method for investigating disturbance development in boundary layers that overcomes the limitations of conventional PSE and non-modal OWNS frameworks.", "method": "Combines modal ansatz from parabolised stability equations (PSE) with recursion-parameter parabolisation strategy from non-modal OWNS to stabilize streamwise-marching modal algorithm.", "result": "M-OWNS permits arbitrarily small streamwise step-sizes while maintaining stability, captures fine-scale baseflow variations, and is more robust than conventional non-modal OWNS while recovering identical modal and non-modal phenomena.", "conclusion": "Modal OWNS framework offers significant advantages in robustness and computational efficiency over conventional methods while retaining capability to capture both modal and non-modal disturbance development."}}

In dimension $1$ we extend works of T. Richard and M. Simon, showing that any oriented compact Alexandrov surface with bounded integral curvature and without cusp is the initial datum of a K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper provides conditions for positive (1,1)-currents to induce metric structures that are Gromov-Hausdorff limits of K\u00e4hler manifolds, and extends K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow results to Alexandrov surfaces in dimension 1.", "motivation": "To understand when positive (1,1)-currents on compact K\u00e4hler manifolds can generate metric structures that approximate smooth K\u00e4hler manifolds, and to extend K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow theory to singular surfaces.", "method": "Develop sufficient conditions for positive (1,1)-currents to induce Gromov-Hausdorff convergent metric structures, and apply K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow techniques to Alexandrov surfaces with bounded integral curvature.", "result": "Established conditions under which (1,1)-currents produce metric limits of K\u00e4hler manifolds, and proved that oriented compact Alexandrov surfaces without cusps can initiate K\u00e4hler-Ricci flows.", "conclusion": "The work connects singular metric structures with smooth K\u00e4hler geometry through Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and extends the applicability of K\u00e4hler-Ricci flows to broader classes of surfaces."}}
