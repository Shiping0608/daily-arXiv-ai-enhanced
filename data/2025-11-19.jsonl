Such integrals appear in the Galerkin discretizations of integral equations and nonlocal partial differential equations. The polytope is decomposed into a number of convex hulls of a singular and regular face. This expresses the singularity in a single variable which is effectively handled by Gauss-Jacobi quadrature. The decomposition algorithm is applicable to general finite polytopes. The Cartesian product of two simplices and two cubes will be discussed as special cases and numerical examples will be presented to illustrate the convergence of the resulting quadrature scheme."}

This paper introduces a methodology leveraging CUR decomposition for solving large-scale generalized Sylvester as well as non-Sylvester multi-term equations on low-rank matrix manifolds. The approach decomposes the original equation into two smaller subproblems: one involving all columns with a small subset of rows, and the other involving all rows with a small subset of columns. The rows and columns are strategically selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method. We further utilize the CUR properties and propose a novel iterative scheme that removes the dependencies between selected and unselected rows (and likewise for columns), thereby enabling the subset problems to be solved independently. We present a Krylov-based scheme for solving the resulting subproblems, which scales effectively to large problems and does not rely on a Sylvester structure. The method incorporates rank adaptivity, dynamically adjusting computational rank to reach the desired accuracy. The methodology is demonstrated in three representative settings: (i) implicit time integration of matrix differential equations on low-rank manifolds, leading to multi-term linear matrix equations; (ii) large-scale steady-state generalized Lyapunov equations including cases of size up to $10^{13}$ unknown entries; and (iii) non-Sylvester linear matrix equations with Hadamard product terms, such as those arising in nonlinear partial differential equations."}

Unlike the method-of-lines approach for moving domain simulation, the grid velocity is implicitly embedded into the curvilinear geometric representation of space-time elements. Several key issues in moving domain simulation, including the discrete geometric conservation law (GCL), solution and flux approximation, and aliasing error control, are discussed in the context of the nodal STFR framework. Conditions and the corresponding numerical strategies to reduce aliasing errors due to the curvilinear space-time representation of moving domain problems, including the discrete GCL errors (i.e. one type of aliasing errors in the space-time framework), are then explained and examined. Since a space-time tensor product is used to construct the FR formulation in this study, all space-time schemes show the temporal superconvergence property, similar to that presented by the implicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (IRK-DG) schemes, in moving domain simulation. Specifically, a nominal $k$th order scheme can achieve a ($2k-1$)th order superconvergence rate when solutions on $k$ Gauss-Legendre points are used to construct polynomials in the time dimension. The robustness of temporal superconvergence in the existence of aliasing errors induced by the curvilinear space-time representation, and upon de-aliasing operations based on polynomial filtering, has been examined with numerical experiments."}

We find that inelastic electron cooling is essential for achieving a physically consistent, neutralized beam. Increasing the background pressure enhances ion-neutral collisions, leading to more charge- and momentum-exchange events that reduce ion mean energies, broaden the beam, and increase sidewall losses. Including inelastic processes flattens the potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, and preserves beam collimation farther downstream. Single-particle trajectory analyses show that primary electrons undergo mixed escape and temporary trapping, while low energy post-inelastic electrons remain confined, sustaining the neutralization cloud. Sheath diagnostics reveal that at the beam dump, classical Child-Langmuir and Hutchinson models underpredict the sheath length due to residual electrons, while near the sidewall, the sheath is truncated by beam-sheath interference within the compact domain.

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design."}

In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd.

In a two-dimensional benchmark, we observe exponential energy growth and resulting artificial fragmentation under standard contact penalty settings and time step choices, which motivates a systematic analysis of instability sources. Three mechanisms are isolated and quantified: (i) diverging initial cohesive stiffness, which constrains the stable time step; (ii) discontinuous stiffness jumps at the cohesive-contact interface; and (iii) discontinuity introduced by cohesive softening. Analytical error estimates, phase-space diagnostics, and energy growth metrics reveal that repeated cohesive-contact switching can accumulate small per-step energy errors into long-term energy drift. Within the explored parameter space, maintaining stability requires time steps well below the usual limit. To mitigate these energy artifacts, we assess an adaptive penalty strategy that ties the contact stiffness to the evolving cohesive stiffness. This modification eliminates the discontinuity and restores energy conservation, but it allows larger interpenetration, making it suitable as a diagnostic rather than a definitive remedy. Overall, our study identifies the root causes of unphysical energy drift and demonstrates that penalty-based contact is not a viable approach for long-term, energy-consistent fragmentation simulations with physically meaningful fragment statistics."}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade.

We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons.

This implies that the associated integral operator is a quasi-projection in the sense of Jia (2004). Moreover, the approximation of smooth functions in Sobolev spaces by this quasi-projection yields the optimal approximation order. More recently, for applications in isogeometric analysis, the optimal approximation order should also be obtained for functions in a slightly larger space, the so-called bent Sobolev space defined in \\cite{Bazilevsetal2006,daVeigaetal2014}.

To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant.

We are able to vary independently the swelling degree and the relative size of vesicles, the viscosities of fluids internal and external to vesicles, and the Capillary number, so to observe a rich dynamical phenomenology which goes well beyond what observed for single vesicles, matching quantitatively with experimental findings. Tank-treading, tumbling, and trembling motions are enriched by dynamical states where inner and outer vesicles can perform different motions.

To comply with industrial waste regulations, vinasse must be stored, which enables evaporation, leaving behind a residual sludge. However, treating vinasse remains an environmental and industrial challenge, having a high nutrient concentration and acidity that can degrade soil quality and harm surrounding vegetation. While previous studies have modeled sludge generation and transport in urban water systems, research on industrial wastewater, such as the alcohol industry, remains limited, affecting the search for opportunities to improve the treatment process.. This paper proposes a System Dynamics Model (SDM) to assess the costs associated with three management strategies: natural drying of vinasse, relocation to an alternative site, and implementation of a coagulation- flocculation treatment to accelerate sludge production. This paper makes two contributions. First, we describe a pioneer SDM applicable to sludge management, which includes variables such as sludge transport, coagulant quantity, and ambient temperature to make hypothetical scenarios that affect the treatment processes of vinasse. Second, we present the expected results of the associated costs of the scenarios proposed in the model, helping decision-makers to manage vinasse. The model is calibrated with historical data provided by a company in the North of Chile, helping to improve the decision-making for vinasse treatment."}

They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure."}

We find that inelastic electron cooling is essential for achieving a physically consistent, neutralized beam. Increasing the background pressure enhances ion-neutral collisions, leading to more charge- and momentum-exchange events that reduce ion mean energies, broaden the beam, and increase sidewall losses. Including inelastic processes flattens the potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, and preserves beam collimation farther downstream.

Unlike the method-of-lines approach for moving domain simulation, the grid velocity is implicitly embedded into the curvilinear geometric representation of space-time elements. Several key issues in moving domain simulation, including the discrete geometric conservation law (GCL), solution and flux approximation, and aliasing error control, are discussed in the context of the nodal STFR framework. Conditions and the corresponding numerical strategies to reduce aliasing errors due to the curvilinear space-time representation of moving domain problems, including the discrete GCL errors (i.e. one type of aliasing errors in the space-time framework), are then explained and examined. Since a space-time tensor product is used to construct the FR formulation in this study, all space-time schemes show the temporal superconvergence property, similar to that presented by the implicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (IRK-DG) schemes, in moving domain simulation. Specifically, a nominal $k$th order scheme can achieve a ($2k-1$)th order superconvergence rate when solutions on $k$ Gauss-Legendre points are used to construct polynomials in the time dimension. The robustness of temporal superconvergence in the existence of aliasing errors induced by the curvilinear space-time representation, and upon de-aliasing operations based on polynomial filtering, has been examined with numerical experiments."}

We prove well-posedness and stability of the flow, and that, in the long term, the energy always converges to its minimal value. The analysis is based on a change of variable to study the flow in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the evolution is no longer a gradient flow but described by a monotone operator. Under a restrictive assumption we prove the convergence of our modified JKO scheme towards this flow as the time step vanishes.

In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \\to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\\langle v \\rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\\langle v \\rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications."}

While historically studied in an ``almost-everywhere'' or asymptotic sense, $D_N$ for finite N is increasingly an object of interest for its nontrivial properties that depend on the Diophantine properties of $ρ$. This behavior is periodic in N with respect to the quotients of the continued fraction convergents, which grow quickly for some irrationals. Thus the stable computation of the sum is necessary for forming conjectures about its properties. However, computing the exact value of the sum and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability in the sum itself and the failure of sampling methods to capture its jump discontinuities. This paper presents a novel computational algorithm that fully defines the discrepancy function and its associated pdf through its discontinuities. This allows the calculation of $D_N(x,ρ)$ to machine precision with minimal storage in O(N) time. This vast improvement in computability over the O(N^2) naive version enables, for the first time, the direct computation of the exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, and with it, key properties of the discrepancy: $ \\|D_N \\|_{\\infty}$ (half of the support of the pdf), $ \\|D_N \\|_{2}^2$ (the variance of the pdf), and the kurtosis of the pdf. A key strength of the algorithm lies in its ability to produce clear, exact figures, allowing the development of mathematical intuition and the quick testing of conjectures. As an example, a newly conjectured pattern is presented: when $ρ$ is well-approximated by rational $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, the pdf exhibits a predictable spiked-trapezoidal pattern when $N=kq_n$. These shapes degrade as $k$ increases, at a speed depending on how well $\\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ approximates $ρ$."}

Couette flow induces mixing and generates magnetic induction, while the constant magnetic field stabilizes $z$-dependent modes. In contrast, the $z$-averaged magnetic field exhibits algebraic growth. Letting $μ$ denote the inverse fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, we analyze how $μ$ governs stability thresholds in Sobolev spaces.\n  We identify a nonlinear transient-growth regime characterized by the sharp threshold $5/6\\le γ\\le 1 $. For $x$-average-free initial data of size $μ^γ$, solutions are nonlinearly stable; however, for certain initial data, the solution departs from the linear dynamics at rate $μ^{γ-1}$ due to a first-order nonlinear instability. The exponent $γ= 5/6$ is optimal for the associated energy functional and cannot be improved in Sobolev spaces without secondary transient-growth mechanisms. Below this threshold, solutions necessarily transition away from the linear dynamics at a minimal rate.\n  As a consequence, the $3d$ results yield sharp Sobolev stability thresholds for the $2d$ MHD equations around Couette flow without a constant magnetic field. In particular, the threshold is strictly larger than in prior $2d$ results with a constant field, revealing destabilizing effects normally suppressed by a constant magnetic field. Crucially, this stabilization is restricted to the direction of the magnetic field."}

In the PINN framework, the governing partial differential equations, along with initial and boundary conditions, are encoded directly into the loss function, enabling the network to learn solutions that are consistent with the underlying physics. In this work, we employ the PINN framework to solve the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for three two-dimensional incompressible, steady, laminar flow problems without using any labeled data. The boundary and initial conditions are enforced in a hard manner, ensuring they are satisfied exactly rather than penalized during training. We validate the PINN predicted velocity profiles, drag coefficients and pressure profiles against the conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for moderate to high values of Reynolds number ($Re$). It is observed that the PINN predictions show good agreement with the CFD results at lower $Re$. We also extend our analysis to a transient condition and find that our method is equally capable of simulating complex time-dependent flow dynamics. To quantitatively assess the accuracy, we compute the $L_2$ normalized error, which lies in the range $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ - $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for our chosen case studies."}

As the particle number grows to infinity and their size goes to zero we derive the monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations as mean-field limit. We do this under the assumption that the particles have initial velocities given by a Lipschitz velocity profile and prove the mean-field limit for times of the order of the inverse Lipschitz constant. Notably this is not a perturbative result. In particular, we do not require the inertia of the particles to vanish in the limit. Thereby the result improves upon the perturbative derivation in [HS23] in the case of a monokinetic limit density."}

We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the \"curse of dimensionality\" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models."}

We present a unified workflow that reconstructs the Helmholtz free-energy surface from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with zero-point energy corrections from harmonic/quasi-harmonic theory. The framework propagates statistical uncertainties, mitigates finite-size effects, and employs active learning to optimize sampling in the volume-temperature space. It applies seamlessly to both crystalline and liquid phases. We demonstrate the methodology by computing heat capacities, thermal expansion, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, and melting properties for nine elemental FCC and BCC metals using 20 classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials, with all predictions accompanied by quantified confidence intervals.

At its core, an alternating architecture decouples the optimization by parameterizing the state, adjoint and topology fields with three distinct Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs). These networks are trained through a collaborative and stable alternating optimization scheme applicable to both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems. The Ginzburg-Landau energy functional is incorporated into the topology network's loss function, acting as an intrinsic regularizer that promotes well-defined designs with smooth and distinct interfaces. By employing physics-informed losses derived from either variational principles or strong-form PDE residuals, the broad applicability of the APF-FNNs is demonstrated across a spectrum of 2D and 3D multi-physics benchmarks, including compliance minimization, eigenvalue maximization, and Stokes/Navier-Stokes flow optimization. The proposed APF-FNNs consistently yield high-performance and high-resolution topologies, establishing a powerful and versatile foundation for physics-driven computational design."}
