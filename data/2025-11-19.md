### [1] [Quadrature for Singular Integrals over convex Polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13974)
*Johannes Tausch*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: New algorithm for efficient numerical approximation of weakly singular integrals over convex polytopes using decomposition and Gauss-Jacobi quadrature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly singular integrals appear in Galerkin discretizations of integral equations and nonlocal PDEs, requiring efficient numerical approximation methods.

Method: Decompose polytope into convex hulls of singular and regular faces, expressing singularity in single variable handled by Gauss-Jacobi quadrature.

Result: Algorithm applicable to general finite polytopes, with special cases discussed for Cartesian products of simplices and cubes. Numerical examples demonstrate convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed quadrature scheme provides an effective method for approximating weakly singular integrals over convex polytopes with demonstrated convergence.

Abstract: A new algorithm for the efficient numerical approximation of weakly singular integrals over convex polytopes is introduced. Such integrals appear in the Galerkin discretizations of integral equations and nonlocal partial differential equations. The polytope is decomposed into a number of convex hulls of a singular and regular face. This expresses the singularity in a single variable which is effectively handled by Gauss-Jacobi quadrature. The decomposition algorithm is applicable to general finite polytopes. The Cartesian product of two simplices and two cubes will be discussed as special cases and numerical examples will be presented to illustrate the convergence of the resulting quadrature scheme.

### [2] [A CUR Krylov Solver for Large-Scale Linear Matrix Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14015)
*Saeed Akbari,Damiano Lombardi,Hessam Babaee*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel CUR decomposition-based method for solving large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations using strategically selected rows and columns, with rank adaptivity and applicability to both Sylvester and non-Sylvester structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient solvers for large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations remains a central challenge in numerical linear algebra and is largely unresolved, particularly for problems with billions or trillions of unknowns.

Method: Leverages CUR decomposition to split the original equation into two smaller subproblems using strategically selected rows and columns via discrete empirical interpolation method, with a novel iterative scheme that removes dependencies between selected and unselected rows/columns, and a Krylov-based scheme for solving subproblems.

Result: The method scales effectively to large problems (demonstrated for sizes up to 10^13 unknown entries), handles both Sylvester and non-Sylvester structures, incorporates rank adaptivity, and successfully applies to matrix differential equations, generalized Lyapunov equations, and non-Sylvester equations with Hadamard product terms.

Conclusion: The proposed CUR decomposition methodology provides an efficient, scalable solution for large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations across various applications, overcoming previous limitations in handling massive problems and non-Sylvester structures.

Abstract: Developing efficient solvers for large-scale multi-term linear matrix equations remains a central challenge in numerical linear algebra and is still largely unresolved. This paper introduces a methodology leveraging CUR decomposition for solving large-scale generalized Sylvester as well as non-Sylvester multi-term equations on low-rank matrix manifolds. The approach decomposes the original equation into two smaller subproblems: one involving all columns with a small subset of rows, and the other involving all rows with a small subset of columns. The rows and columns are strategically selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method. We further utilize the CUR properties and propose a novel iterative scheme that removes the dependencies between selected and unselected rows (and likewise for columns), thereby enabling the subset problems to be solved independently. We present a Krylov-based scheme for solving the resulting subproblems, which scales effectively to large problems and does not rely on a Sylvester structure. The method incorporates rank adaptivity, dynamically adjusting computational rank to reach the desired accuracy. The methodology is demonstrated in three representative settings: (i) implicit time integration of matrix differential equations on low-rank manifolds, leading to multi-term linear matrix equations; (ii) large-scale steady-state generalized Lyapunov equations including cases of size up to $10^{13}$ unknown entries; and (iii) non-Sylvester linear matrix equations with Hadamard product terms, such as those arising in nonlinear partial differential equations.

### [4] [High-order Nodal Space-time Flux Reconstruction Methods for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Curvilinear Moving Grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14128)
*Meilin Yu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Development of high-order nodal space-time flux reconstruction methods for hyperbolic conservation laws on moving grids, with focus on geometric conservation law, aliasing error control, and temporal superconvergence properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in moving domain simulations, including discrete geometric conservation law, solution/flux approximation, and aliasing error control in curvilinear space-time representations.

Method: Nodal space-time flux reconstruction framework on curvilinear moving grids, embedding grid velocity implicitly into space-time elements, using space-time tensor product construction with polynomial filtering for de-aliasing.

Result: Achieved temporal superconvergence where kth order schemes can achieve (2k-1)th order convergence rates using Gauss-Legendre points, with robustness maintained despite aliasing errors from curvilinear representations.

Conclusion: The space-time flux reconstruction framework successfully handles moving domain problems with embedded grid velocity, provides temporal superconvergence similar to IRK-DG schemes, and maintains robustness when addressing aliasing errors through de-aliasing operations.

Abstract: High-order nodal space-time flux reconstruction (STFR) methods have been developed to solve hyperbolic conservation laws on curvilinear moving grids. Unlike the method-of-lines approach for moving domain simulation, the grid velocity is implicitly embedded into the curvilinear geometric representation of space-time elements. Several key issues in moving domain simulation, including the discrete geometric conservation law (GCL), solution and flux approximation, and aliasing error control, are discussed in the context of the nodal STFR framework. Conditions and the corresponding numerical strategies to reduce aliasing errors due to the curvilinear space-time representation of moving domain problems, including the discrete GCL errors (i.e. one type of aliasing errors in the space-time framework), are then explained and examined. Since a space-time tensor product is used to construct the FR formulation in this study, all space-time schemes show the temporal superconvergence property, similar to that presented by the implicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (IRK-DG) schemes, in moving domain simulation. Specifically, a nominal $k$th order scheme can achieve a ($2k-1$)th order superconvergence rate when solutions on $k$ Gauss-Legendre points are used to construct polynomials in the time dimension. The robustness of temporal superconvergence in the existence of aliasing errors induced by the curvilinear space-time representation, and upon de-aliasing operations based on polynomial filtering, has been examined with numerical experiments.

*Jean-Philippe Chancelier,Pierre Carpentier,Guy Cohen,Thierry Dargent,Richard Epenoy*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Fuel-optimal spatial vehicle control with stochastic engine failures, solved using dualization and Arrow-Hurwicz algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address temporary stochastic engine failures that prevent reaching target despite fuel optimization in deterministic settings.

Method: Formulate stochastic optimal control with probability constraint, dualize constraint, use Arrow-Hurwicz stochastic algorithm.

Result: Numerical results presented for interplanetary mission application.

Conclusion: Successfully solved fuel minimization with reliability constraint using stochastic optimization approach.

Abstract: The problem under consideration is to drive a spatial vehicle to a target at a given final time while minimizing fuel consumption. This is a classical optimal control problem in a deterministic setting. However temporary stochastic failures of the engine may prevent reaching the target after the engine usage is recovered. Therefore, a stochastic optimal control problem is formulated under the constraint of ensuring a minimal probability of hitting the target. This problem is modeled, improved and finally solved by dualizing the probability constraint and using an Arrow-Hurwicz stochastic algorithm. Numerical results concerning an interplanetary mission are presented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the importance of modified Hamiltonians for Poisson integrators and investigate their stability properties on different types of systems.

Method: Using Lotka-Volterra dynamics as examples, the authors construct a non-integrable 5-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and perform numerical investigations to study stability properties.

Result: The paper provides numerical analysis of Hamiltonian Poisson integrators' behavior on both integrable and non-integrable Lotka-Volterra systems.

Conclusion: The existence of a modified Hamiltonian is crucial for Poisson integrators, and numerical investigations reveal important stability properties across different system types.

Abstract: Hamiltonian Poisson integrators are Poisson integrators that admit a modified Hamiltonian. In this article, we illustrate the importance of the existence of a modified Hamiltonian for Poisson integrators in the context of integrable and non-integrable systems. Examples of Hamiltonian systems are provided by Lotka-Volterra dynamics; in order to investigate stability properties of Hamiltonian Poisson integrators on non-integrable systems, we exhibit a non-integrable $5$-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and pursue numerical investigations of it.

### [7] [Unfitted Lattice Green's Function Method for Exterior Scattering in Complex Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14346)
*Siyuan Wang,Qing Xia*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A finite-difference boundary integral method for 2D exterior scattering using lattice Green's functions that eliminates singularities and works with arbitrary geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a numerical method that combines the advantages of boundary integral methods (dimension reduction, no artificial boundaries) with finite differences for complex geometries.

Method: Uses discrete fundamental solutions (lattice Green's functions) for Helmholtz equation on infinite lattice, constructs boundary algebraic equations via discrete potentials, and incorporates boundary conditions through Lagrange interpolation on unfitted cut cells.

Result: Numerical results show the method is accurate and robust for various scatterer shapes including circular, triangular, and multiple-body configurations.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges boundary integral and finite difference approaches, maintaining key advantages of both while eliminating singularities and handling complex geometries.

Abstract: This paper develops a finite-difference analogue of the boundary integral/element method for the numerical solution of two-dimensional exterior scattering from scatterers of arbitrary shapes. The discrete fundamental solution, known as the lattice Green's function (LGF), for the Helmholtz equation on an infinite lattice is derived and employed to construct boundary algebraic equations through the discrete potentials framework. Unlike the continuous fundamental solution used in boundary integral methods, the LGF introduces no singularity, which simplifies numerical implementation. Boundary conditions are incorporated through local Lagrange interpolation on unfitted cut cells. The resulting method retains key advantages of boundary integral approaches-including dimension reduction and the absence of artificial boundary conditions--while enabling finite differences for complex geometries. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method for various scatterers, including circular, triangular, and multiple-body configurations.

### [8] [Approximate Duals of B-splines for the Exact Representation of Splines on Coarse Knot Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14443)
*Joachim Stöckler*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper presents enhanced approximate duals of B-splines for optimal approximation in bent Sobolev spaces, with explicit constructions for orders 2-3 and numerical validation for orders 3-6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve optimal approximation order for functions in bent Sobolev spaces in isogeometric analysis applications, requiring enhanced approximate duals that can exactly represent spline functions using minimal interior knots.

Method: Construction of enhanced approximate duals as splines with local support, whose integral operators provide exact representation of spline functions with respect to coarse knot vectors using few interior knots.

Result: Explicit constructions provided for m=2 and m=3, with numerical examples demonstrating optimal approximation order for splines of order 3≤m≤6 in bent Sobolev spaces.

Conclusion: The analysis provides explicit construction methods and computational hints for enhanced approximate duals, enabling optimal approximation in bent Sobolev spaces for isogeometric analysis applications.

Abstract: Approximate duals of B-splines were first used by Chui et al. (2004) for the purpose of constructing tight wavelet frames on bounded intervals. They are splines with local support, whose inner product with a polynomial in the spline space provides the exact coefficient in the representation of the same polynomial in the B-spline basis. This implies that the associated integral operator is a quasi-projection in the sense of Jia (2004). Moreover, the approximation of smooth functions in Sobolev spaces by this quasi-projection yields the optimal approximation order. More recently, for applications in isogeometric analysis, the optimal approximation order should also be obtained for functions in a slightly larger space, the so-called bent Sobolev space defined in \cite{Bazilevsetal2006,daVeigaetal2014}. This requires the construction of enhanced approximate duals, whose corresponding integral operator provides the exact representation of all spline functions with respect to a coarse knot vector, using only few interior knots of the given knot vector. Our analysis provides an explicit construction and hints for an efficient computation of enhanced approximate duals. Explicit representations as linear combinations of B-splines are provided for $m=2$ and $m=3$, and two numerical examples for splines of order $3\le m\le 6$ demonstrate the optimal approximation order for functions in bent Sobolev spaces.

### [9] [A System Dynamics Approach to Evaluating Sludge Management Strategies in Vinasse Treatment: Cost-Benefit Analysis and Scenario Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14607)
*Agustin Olivares,Paul Leger,Rodrigo Poblete*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A System Dynamics Model (SDM) is developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of three vinasse management strategies in Chile's pisco industry: natural drying, relocation, and coagulation-flocculation treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vinasse from alcohol production (10-15L per 1L alcohol) poses environmental challenges due to high nutrient concentration and acidity, degrading soil quality. Limited research exists on industrial wastewater management in alcohol industry.

Method: Developed a System Dynamics Model incorporating variables like sludge transport, coagulant quantity, and ambient temperature to simulate scenarios affecting vinasse treatment processes. Calibrated with historical data from a Chilean company.

Result: The model provides expected cost results for three management strategies, enabling decision-makers to assess cost-effectiveness of different vinasse treatment approaches.

Conclusion: The SDM serves as a pioneering tool for sludge management in alcohol industry, helping improve decision-making for vinasse treatment through scenario analysis and cost assessment.

Abstract: In the Chilean local alcohol industry (pisco indus- try), for one liter of alcohol produced 10-15 liters of vinasse as the main wastewater of the process. To comply with industrial waste regulations, vinasse must be stored, which enables evaporation, leaving behind a residual sludge. However, treating vinasse remains an environmental and industrial challenge, having a high nutrient concentration and acidity that can degrade soil quality and harm surrounding vegetation. While previous studies have modeled sludge generation and transport in urban water systems, research on industrial wastewater, such as the alcohol industry, remains limited, affecting the search for opportunities to improve the treatment process.. This paper proposes a System Dynamics Model (SDM) to assess the costs associated with three management strategies: natural drying of vinasse, relocation to an alternative site, and implementation of a coagulation- flocculation treatment to accelerate sludge production. This paper makes two contributions. First, we describe a pioneer SDM applicable to sludge management, which includes variables such as sludge transport, coagulant quantity, and ambient temperature to make hypothetical scenarios that affect the treatment processes of vinasse. Second, we present the expected results of the associated costs of the scenarios proposed in the model, helping decision-makers to manage vinasse. The model is calibrated with historical data provided by a company in the North of Chile, helping to improve the decision-making for vinasse treatment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works only provided optimal H1-norm error estimates but not optimal L2-norm estimates due to nonlinear coupled terms in the two-phase MHD system.

Method: Uses fully discrete convex-splitting FEM with semi-implicit backward Euler time scheme, Taylor-Hood/Mini elements for velocity/pressure, and novel Ritz/Stokes quasi-projections for L2-norm analysis.

Result: Achieved optimal L2-norm error estimates, ensured mass conservation and unconditional energy stability of the finite element scheme.

Conclusion: Numerical examples validate the theoretical analysis, providing comprehensive error estimates for the two-phase MHD system.

Abstract: In this paper, we perform an optimal L2-norm error analysis of a fully discrete convex-splitting finite element method (FEM) for the two-phase diffuse interface magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. The method use the semi-implicit backward Euler scheme in time and use the standard inf-sup stable Taylor-Hood/Mini elements to discretize the velocity and pressure. The previous works provided the optimal H1-norm error estimates for all components, but not the optimal L2-norm estimates, which are caused by the nonlinear coupled terms. The optimal L2-norm error analysis is achieved through the novel Ritz and Stokes quasi-projections. In addition, the mass conservation and unconditional energy stability of the finite element convex-splitting scheme are ensured. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.

### [13] [Blow-up, decay, and convergence to equilibrium for focusing damped cubic Klein-Gordon and Duffing equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13851)
*Thomas Perrin*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Sharp trichotomy for damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation: solutions either blow up in finite time, decay exponentially to zero, or converge to a ground state, for initial data with energy slightly above ground state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study long-time dynamics of damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation and its space-independent reduction (Duffing equation) on compact 3D Riemannian manifolds.

Method: Under geometric control condition on damping and assumption on stationary solutions, establish trichotomy using complete classification of Duffing dynamics above constant solution energy.

Result: Proved sharp trichotomy: three possible behaviors (blow-up, exponential decay to zero, convergence to ground state) for initial data with energy slightly above ground state.

Conclusion: Provides complete dynamical classification and constructs Klein-Gordon solutions realizing all three behaviors, with spectral criterion ensuring ground states are nonconstant.

Abstract: We study long-time dynamics of the damped focusing cubic Klein-Gordon equation on a compact three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, together with its space-independent reduction, the damped focusing Duffing equation. Under the geometric control condition on the damping and an assumption on the set of stationary solutions, we establish a sharp trichotomy for initial data with energy slightly above that of the ground state: every solution either blows up in finite time, decays exponentially to zero, or converges to a ground state. We provide a complete classification of the Duffing dynamics above the energy of the constant solution, use it to construct Klein-Gordon solutions realising each of the three behaviours, and derive a simple spectral criterion ensuring that the ground states are nonconstant--and hence that the solutions realising the three regimes lie above the ground-state energy.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Novel variational framework for unsteady Stokes equations with Caputo fractional time derivative, addressing analytical challenges through specialized functional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The nonlocal nature of fractional derivatives makes classical methods like Faedo-Galerkin inadequate for analyzing fractional Stokes equations, requiring new mathematical approaches.

Method: Developed new functional spaces for fractional setting, reformulated weak solutions consistent with fractional dynamics, implemented generalized Galerkin scheme.

Result: Successfully extended classical theory to handle fractional Stokes equations, providing rigorous analysis framework for nonlocal fractional dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundation for studying broader classes of fractional PDEs in fluid mechanics and related areas, overcoming limitations of classical methods.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel variational framework for the study of the unsteady Stokes equations in a bounded open Lipschitz domain in R^n, involving a Caputo fractional derivative in time. The nonlocal nature of the fractional derivative presents significant analytical challenges, making classical methods such as the Faedo-Galerkin approach inadequate in their standard form for a full analysis of the problem. To address these difficulties, we develop and rigorously analyze new functional spaces specifically designed for the fractional setting. These spaces allow us to reformulate weak solutions in a manner consistent with the fractional dynamics, thereby enabling the successful implementation of a generalized Galerkin scheme. Our formulation not only extends the classical theory but also provides a foundation for the study of broader classes of fractional partial differential equations in fluid mechanics and related areas.

*Frank Kemayou,Roger Tagne Wafo,Samuel Bowong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Mathematical model for banana-plantain nematode interactions with age-dependent infection dynamics, proving solution existence/uniqueness and analyzing disease-free equilibrium stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate nematode (Radopholus similis) infection dynamics in banana plantations, particularly prevalent in Central Africa, and develop control strategies.

Method: Developed mathematical model with age-dependent root infection/mortality rates, used semi-group theory for solution analysis, and implemented semi-implicit Euler method for numerical simulations.

Result: Proved well-defined model with positive bounded solutions, derived threshold parameter for disease-free equilibrium stability, and showed nematicides effectively mitigate yield losses.

Conclusion: The model provides realistic infection dynamics representation, and impulsive control strategies using nematicides help reduce nematode damage and improve crop yield.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and analyse a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between banana and plantain plants and the nematode \textit{Radopholus similis}, a pest species occurring in banana plantations worldwide, with particularly high prevalence in Central Africa. The model incorporates root infection and mortality rates as functions of root age, providing a more realistic representation of the infection dynamics. We prove that the model is well-defined by establishing the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution using the theory of semi-groups for nonlinear evolutionary systems. We further show that the solution is positive and bounded. Under additional assumptions on the regularity of the parameters and the data, we prove that the mild solution is indeed a classical solution. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of the solution by deriving a threshold parameter \(\mathcal{N}\), which determines the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the proposed model using the semi-implicit Euler method. The biological consistency of the numerical solutions is established, and simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results and estimate yield losses caused by nematodes. We conclude the numerical analysis by implementing an impulsive control strategy, which confirms that the use of nematicides - whether chemical or biological - helps to mitigate the devastating effects of nematodes and enhances crop yield.

*Giuseppe Toscani,Mattia Zanella*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of Fokker-Planck equations for predator-prey systems showing exponential convergence to equilibrium using energy distances, with explicit convergence rates determined by interaction dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the temporal evolution of statistical distributions in predator-prey populations and establish rigorous convergence to equilibrium for systems with time-dependent coefficients.

Method: Introduced Energy-type distances and analyzed the system in homogeneous Sobolev spaces, examining the dissipative contribution of interaction terms to determine convergence rates.

Result: Proved exponential convergence to equilibrium with explicitly determined rates, recovering Lotka-Volterra dynamics at macroscopic level and identifying equilibrium density families dependent on diffusion coefficients.

Conclusion: The approach reveals intrinsic energy dissipation mechanisms governing predator-prey dynamics and provides a new framework for analyzing convergence to equilibrium in problems with time-dependent coefficients.

Abstract: We study a system of Fokker-Planck equations recently introduced to describe the temporal evolution of statistical distributions of population densities with predator-prey interactions. At the macroscopic level, the system recovers a Lotka-Volterra model and defines an explicit family of equilibrium densities that depend on the form of the diffusion coefficient. By introducing Energy-type distances, we rigorously establish exponential convergence to equilibrium in appropriate homogeneous Sobolev spaces, with a rate explicitly determined by the dissipative contribution of the interaction term. The analysis highlights the intrinsic energy dissipation mechanism governing the dynamics and clarifies how the evolution of expected quantities determines the emergence of a stable equilibrium configuration. This approach provides a new perspective on the convergence to equilibrium for problems with time-dependent coefficients.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Schrödinger operators with magnetic potentials in bounded domains, showing exponential decay of ground states away from boundary regions where the magnetic field vanishes maximally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how magnetic fields affect the behavior of ground states in quantum systems, particularly the localization properties near boundaries where magnetic fields vanish.

Method: Study the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map Λ_β for Schrödinger operators (D+βA)² with magnetic potentials in bounded Lipschitz domains, assuming the magnetic field B=∇×A is of finite type.

Result: For sufficiently large field strength β>β₀, the ground state for Λ_β decays exponentially away from neighborhoods of boundary subsets where B vanishes to maximal order.

Conclusion: Strong magnetic fields localize ground states near boundary regions where the magnetic field vanishes most strongly, exhibiting exponential decay behavior.

Abstract: Consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $Λ_β$ associated with the Schrödinger operator $(D+β\A)^2$ with a magnetic potential in a bounded Lipschitz domain $Ω$, where $β>1$ is the field strength parameter. Assume that the magnetic field $\B=\nabla \times \A$ is of finite type. We show that if $β>β_0$, the ground state for $Λ_β$ decays exponentially away from a neighborhood of the subset of $\partialΩ$, on which $\B$ vanishes to the maximal order.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the existence of multiple segregated solutions in critical coupled Schrödinger systems with repulsive coupling, particularly when the coupling term is sublinear and non-smooth, which presents analytical challenges.

Method: Constructs a tailored complete metric space and combines finite-dimensional reduction with a novel tail minimization argument to overcome the sublinear and non-smooth nature of the coupling term.

Result: Proves existence of infinitely many non-radial segregated solutions for all sufficiently large integers k, with solutions exhibiting multiple bumps concentrating on two separate circles and developing dead cores near each other's concentration points.

Conclusion: The approach successfully handles the analytical difficulties of sublinear non-smooth coupling terms and establishes rich solution structures in critical coupled Schrödinger systems with repulsive interactions.

Abstract: We study the existence of multiple segregated solutions to the critical coupled Schrödinger system
  $-Δu_1 = K_1(| y|) \lvert u_{1}\rvert^{2^{*}-2}u_{1}+β\lvert u_{2}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}\lvert u_{1}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{1}, -Δu_{2} = K_2(\lvert y\rvert) \lvert u_{2}\rvert^{2^{*}-2}u_{2}+β\lvert u_{1}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}}\lvert u_{2}\rvert^{\frac{2^{*}}{2}-2}u_{2}, y\in\mathbb R^N, u_{1},u_{2}\geq0,u_{1},u_{2}\in C_{0}(\mathbb R^{N})\cap D^{1,2}(\mathbb R^N),$
  with $N \geq 5$, $2^* = \frac{2N}{N-2}$, radial potentials $K_1, K_2 > 0$,and repulsive coupling $β< 0$.Under the assumption that $K_1$ and $K_2$ attain local maxima at distinct radii $r_0 \ne ρ_0$ with precise asymptotic expansions near these points, we prove the existence of infinitely many non-radial segregated solutions $(u_{1,k}, u_{2,k})$ for all sufficiently large integers $k$. These solutions exhibit multiple bumps concentrating on two separate circles of radius $r_0$ and $ρ_0$ respectively. Moreover, each component develops a ``dead core'' near the concentration points of the other. The proof overcomes the sublinear and non-smooth nature of the coupling term ($2^*/2 -1 < 1$) by constructing a tailored complete metric space and combining a finite-dimensional reduction with a novel tail minimization argument.

TL;DR: Analysis of gradient flow using Sinkhorn divergences instead of optimal transport geometry, showing well-posedness, stability, and long-term energy convergence to minimum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study gradient flows in probability measure spaces using Sinkhorn divergences (debiased entropic optimal transport) as an alternative to traditional optimal transport geometry.

Method: Formal limit of minimizing movement/JKO scheme with Sinkhorn divergence replacing squared Wasserstein distance; analysis via change of variables to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space where evolution becomes monotone operator; numerical illustrations.

Result: Proved well-posedness and stability of the flow; showed energy always converges to minimal value in long term; under restrictive assumption, proved convergence of modified JKO scheme to flow as time step vanishes.

Conclusion: Sinkhorn divergence-based gradient flow provides a well-defined alternative to optimal transport gradient flows with interesting properties and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: We analyze the gradient flow of a potential energy in the space of probability measures when we substitute the optimal transport geometry with a geometry based on Sinkhorn divergences, a debiased version of entropic optimal transport. This gradient flow appears formally as the limit of the minimizing movement scheme, a.k.a. JKO scheme, when the squared Wasserstein distance is substituted by the Sinkhorn divergence. We prove well-posedness and stability of the flow, and that, in the long term, the energy always converges to its minimal value. The analysis is based on a change of variable to study the flow in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the evolution is no longer a gradient flow but described by a monotone operator. Under a restrictive assumption we prove the convergence of our modified JKO scheme towards this flow as the time step vanishes. We also provide numerical illustrations of the intriguing properties of this newly defined gradient flow.

Motivation: To establish existence of solutions for nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love plate model under any applied forces and boundary conditions, and provide conditions ensuring plate rigidity

Method: Mathematical analysis proving existence of solutions for the nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love plate model, then deriving sufficient conditions for plate rigidity

Result: Proved existence of solutions for Kirchhoff-Love plate model for any applied forces and boundary conditions; provided sufficient conditions ensuring plate rigidity

Conclusion: Results substantially generalize Rabier's existence theorem which assumed clamped boundary conditions, providing broader applicability for plate analysis

Abstract: A plate is rigid if its admissible displacement fields inducing vanishing two-dimensional strain tensors must vanish. We prove that the nonlinear model of Kirchhoff-Love for such a plate has a solution for any applied forces and boundary conditions. Then we give sufficient conditions on the data ensuring the rigidity of the plate. Together, these results substantially generalize an existence theorem by Rabier whereby the plate is assumed to be clamped on its entire boundary.

Motivation: To understand how diffusion affects passive-scalar mixing in fluid flows, particularly whether diffusion can fundamentally suppress mixing rather than just enhance it.

*Niklas Knobel*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of 3D MHD equations near Couette flow with perpendicular magnetic field, identifying nonlinear transient-growth regime with sharp stability threshold γ=5/6-1 in Sobolev spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how magnetic fields stabilize Couette flow in MHD systems and determine precise stability thresholds governed by Reynolds numbers.

Method: Study 3D incompressible MHD equations near Couette flow with constant perpendicular magnetic field, analyzing stability in Sobolev spaces using energy functionals and nonlinear transient-growth analysis.

Result: Identified sharp stability threshold γ=5/6-1: for x-average-free initial data of size μ^γ, solutions are stable; otherwise, nonlinear instability occurs at rate μ^{γ-1}. The 3D results provide sharp thresholds for 2D MHD without constant magnetic field.

Conclusion: Constant magnetic field stabilizes only in its direction, and the threshold γ=5/6 is optimal without secondary mechanisms. 2D results show destabilizing effects normally suppressed by constant magnetic fields.

Abstract: We study the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations near Couette flow with a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the shear plane. Couette flow induces mixing and generates magnetic induction, while the constant magnetic field stabilizes $z$-dependent modes. In contrast, the $z$-averaged magnetic field exhibits algebraic growth. Letting $μ$ denote the inverse fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, we analyze how $μ$ governs stability thresholds in Sobolev spaces.
  We identify a nonlinear transient-growth regime characterized by the sharp threshold $5/6\le γ\le 1 $. For $x$-average-free initial data of size $μ^γ$, solutions are nonlinearly stable; however, for certain initial data, the solution departs from the linear dynamics at rate $μ^{γ-1}$ due to a first-order nonlinear instability. The exponent $γ= 5/6$ is optimal for the associated energy functional and cannot be improved in Sobolev spaces without secondary transient-growth mechanisms. Below this threshold, solutions necessarily transition away from the linear dynamics at a minimal rate.
  As a consequence, the $3d$ results yield sharp Sobolev stability thresholds for the $2d$ MHD equations around Couette flow without a constant magnetic field. In particular, the threshold is strictly larger than in prior $2d$ results with a constant field, revealing destabilizing effects normally suppressed by a constant magnetic field. Crucially, this stabilization is restricted to the direction of the magnetic field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous mean-field limit for microscopic particle systems with inertia, without requiring the inertia to vanish in the limit, addressing limitations of previous perturbative approaches.

Method: Consider microscopic model of spherical particles with inertia in Stokes flow, take particle number to infinity and size to zero, assume initial velocities given by Lipschitz velocity profile, prove mean-field limit for times of order inverse Lipschitz constant.

Result: Successfully derived monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations as mean-field limit, achieving non-perturbative result that works for finite particle inertia.

Conclusion: The work provides improved derivation of mean-field limit for particle systems with inertia, extending beyond perturbative approaches and allowing finite inertia in the limit.

Abstract: We consider a microscopic model of spherical particles with inertia in a Stokes flow. As the particle number grows to infinity and their size goes to zero we derive the monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations as mean-field limit. We do this under the assumption that the particles have initial velocities given by a Lipschitz velocity profile and prove the mean-field limit for times of the order of the inverse Lipschitz constant. Notably this is not a perturbative result. In particular, we do not require the inertia of the particles to vanish in the limit. Thereby the result improves upon the perturbative derivation in [HS23] in the case of a monokinetic limit density.

Motivation: Heterogeneous porous materials are crucial in engineering systems, and microstructure characterization/reconstruction is essential for physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and performance enhancement.

Includes chunking strategy for large 3D microstructures and spatial location masks for heterogeneous generation.

Result: Method performs stochastic and controllable reconstruction with small sample sizes, generates large-size 3D microstructures (512 and 1024), and excels at creating spatially heterogeneous complex microstructures across various materials.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness through comparative analysis, providing new insights for structure-property linkage research and material inverse design.

Abstract: Heterogeneous porous materials play a crucial role in various engineering systems. Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.

TL;DR: Dynamic fragmentation simulations using cohesive-zone models with penalty-based contact suffer from severe instabilities causing exponential energy growth and artificial fragmentation, requiring time steps well below normal limits for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the severe instabilities observed in explicit dynamic fragmentation simulations that combine extrinsic cohesive-zone models with penalty-based contact, which exhibit exponential energy growth and artificial fragmentation.

Method: Systematic analysis isolating three instability mechanisms: diverging initial cohesive stiffness, discontinuous stiffness jumps at cohesive-contact interface, and cohesive softening discontinuities. Used analytical error estimates, phase-space diagnostics, and energy growth metrics.

Result: Identified that repeated cohesive-contact switching accumulates small per-step energy errors into long-term energy drift. Adaptive penalty strategy tying contact stiffness to evolving cohesive stiffness eliminates discontinuity and restores energy conservation but allows larger interpenetration.

Conclusion: Penalty-based contact is not viable for long-term, energy-consistent fragmentation simulations with physically meaningful fragment statistics due to inherent instabilities causing unphysical energy drift.

Abstract: Dynamic fragmentation simulations are essential for predicting material response at high strain rates, yet explicit dynamic simulations that combine an extrinsic cohesive-zone model (CZM) with penalty-based contact often exhibit severe instabilities. In a two-dimensional benchmark, we observe exponential energy growth and resulting artificial fragmentation under standard contact penalty settings and time step choices, which motivates a systematic analysis of instability sources. Three mechanisms are isolated and quantified: (i) diverging initial cohesive stiffness, which constrains the stable time step; (ii) discontinuous stiffness jumps at the cohesive-contact interface; and (iii) discontinuity introduced by cohesive softening. Analytical error estimates, phase-space diagnostics, and energy growth metrics reveal that repeated cohesive-contact switching can accumulate small per-step energy errors into long-term energy drift. Within the explored parameter space, maintaining stability requires time steps well below the usual limit. To mitigate these energy artifacts, we assess an adaptive penalty strategy that ties the contact stiffness to the evolving cohesive stiffness. This modification eliminates the discontinuity and restores energy conservation, but it allows larger interpenetration, making it suitable as a diagnostic rather than a definitive remedy. Overall, our study identifies the root causes of unphysical energy drift and demonstrates that penalty-based contact is not a viable approach for long-term, energy-consistent fragmentation simulations with physically meaningful fragment statistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand facility effects on ion thruster plumes under ground-test conditions, particularly how plasma processes govern beam neutralization and wall interactions.

Method: Used fully kinetic 3D Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision solver coupled with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo neutral background for detailed plasma process examination.

Result: Inelastic electron cooling flattens potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, preserves beam collimation. Higher pressure increases ion-neutral collisions, reduces ion energies, broadens beam, increases sidewall losses. Classical sheath models underpredict sheath length.

Conclusion: Inelastic processes are essential for physically consistent beam neutralization, and facility background pressure significantly impacts beam characteristics and wall interactions.

Abstract: We investigate facility effects on a reduced-scale gridded ion thruster plume using a fully kinetic, three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision (PIC-MCC) solver coupled with a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) neutral background. This approach enables detailed examination of key plasma processes governing beam neutralization and wall interactions under ground-test conditions. We find that inelastic electron cooling is essential for achieving a physically consistent, neutralized beam. Increasing the background pressure enhances ion-neutral collisions, leading to more charge- and momentum-exchange events that reduce ion mean energies, broaden the beam, and increase sidewall losses. Including inelastic processes flattens the potential, sustains quasi-neutrality, and preserves beam collimation farther downstream. Single-particle trajectory analyses show that primary electrons undergo mixed escape and temporary trapping, while low energy post-inelastic electrons remain confined, sustaining the neutralization cloud. Sheath diagnostics reveal that at the beam dump, classical Child-Langmuir and Hutchinson models underpredict the sheath length due to residual electrons, while near the sidewall, the sheath is truncated by beam-sheath interference within the compact domain. Current-flow analysis indicates that higher background pressure conditions yield lower beam energies and increased sidewall currents.

TL;DR: Analysis of oscillatory non-hydrodynamic modes in kinetic theory, showing they correspond to plasma oscillations and are limited to one pair per spatial dimension due to PT-transformation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why non-hydrodynamic frequencies can be oscillatory in resistive magnetohydrodynamics despite typically being purely imaginary in uncharged kinetic theory, and to explore the interplay between Israel-Stewart relaxation and Ampère-Maxwell law.

Method: Used Drude model analysis, applied Onsager-Casimir principle to examine PT-transformation properties, and conducted kinetic theory analysis of charged particles.

Result: Found that oscillatory modes are exact plasma oscillation solutions in Drude model, explained by distinct PT properties (distribution function even, electric field odd), and established maximum of one oscillatory pair per spatial dimension.

Conclusion: The oscillatory nature of certain non-hydrodynamic modes arises from fundamental symmetry properties and is strictly limited in kinetic theory of charged particles, with all other modes remaining on the imaginary axis.

Abstract: It is well known that, at zero wavenumber, the non-hydrodynamic frequencies of uncharged kinetic theory are purely imaginary. On the other hand, it was recently shown that, in resistive magnetohydrodynamics, the interplay between the Israel-Stewart relaxation equation and the Ampère-Maxwell law can give rise to a pair of oscillating non-hydrodynamic modes. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in detail. We first demonstrate that these oscillatory modes are exact solutions of the Drude model, corresponding to ordinary plasma oscillations. We then invoke the Onsager-Casimir principle to explain that their oscillatory nature reflects the distinct PT-transformation properties of the degrees of freedom: the distribution function is even, while the electric field is odd. Finally, we establish that, in a kinetic theory of charged particles, there can be at most one such pair of oscillatory modes per spatial dimension, while all other modes still must sit on the imaginary axis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices by reducing circuit depth in quantum many-body dynamics simulations.

Method: Derives exact ansatz from contraction of time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto two-electron space, starting from mean-field Slater determinant and correlating once rather than sequential correlation/decorrelation.

Result: Successfully demonstrated by simulating time evolution of hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction.

Conclusion: CETE algorithm shows potential for simulating strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum devices with reduced circuit depth.

Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate PINNs' capability in solving complex fluid dynamics problems without requiring labeled training data, using physics-based constraints directly in the loss function.

Method: Hard enforcement of boundary/initial conditions in PINN framework, solving dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for 2D incompressible steady/transient laminar flows.

Result: Good agreement with CFD at lower Re, L2 errors range from 10^-4 to 10^-1; method successfully handles time-dependent flow dynamics.

Conclusion: PINNs provide effective physics-constrained solutions for fluid dynamics problems, particularly at lower Reynolds numbers, without needing labeled data.

Abstract: In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful and robust framework for solving nonlinear differential equations across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, including biology, geophysics, astrophysics and fluid dynamics. In the PINN framework, the governing partial differential equations, along with initial and boundary conditions, are encoded directly into the loss function, enabling the network to learn solutions that are consistent with the underlying physics. In this work, we employ the PINN framework to solve the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for three two-dimensional incompressible, steady, laminar flow problems without using any labeled data. The boundary and initial conditions are enforced in a hard manner, ensuring they are satisfied exactly rather than penalized during training. We validate the PINN predicted velocity profiles, drag coefficients and pressure profiles against the conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for moderate to high values of Reynolds number ($Re$). It is observed that the PINN predictions show good agreement with the CFD results at lower $Re$. We also extend our analysis to a transient condition and find that our method is equally capable of simulating complex time-dependent flow dynamics. To quantitatively assess the accuracy, we compute the $L_2$ normalized error, which lies in the range $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for our chosen case studies.

Motivation: The Gross-Pitaevskii model is fundamental in physics but lacks consistent theory for far-from-equilibrium states and fully developed turbulence, especially for strong interactions.

Method: Developed theory for 2D N-component GP model, used analytical results in many-component limit and direct numerical simulations of single-component GP model.

Result: For attractive interactions: attraction enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to critical-balance state independent of pumping level. For repulsive interactions: repulsion suppressed by collective effects, giving universality independent of bare coupling constant.

Conclusion: Presented first consistent theory of strong turbulence in GP model, revealing universal regimes in both focusing and defocusing cases, confirmed by analytical and numerical approaches.

Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.

TL;DR: Framework for analyzing and controlling oscillation quenching using coupling functions, with novel inhomogeneous states identified and a PI controller developed to maintain oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oscillatory dynamics in systems can be disrupted by time-varying interactions, leading to oscillation quenching where oscillations are suppressed.

Method: Used coupling functions to study bifurcations and transitions in limit-cycle oscillators with time-varying diffusive and periodic coupling, while keeping coupling strength invariant. Applied dynamical Bayesian inference to develop a PI controller.

Result: Identified novel inhomogeneous states not previously reported. Successfully developed a controller that maintains oscillations and prevents quenching.

Conclusion: The framework has broad implications for identifying and controlling oscillation quenching in various systems with time-varying interactions.

Abstract: The oscillatory dynamics of natural and man-made systems can be disrupted by their time-varying interactions, leading to oscillation quenching phenomena in which the oscillations are suppressed. We introduce a framework for analyzing, assessing, and controlling oscillation quenching using coupling functions. Specifically, by observing limit-cycle oscillators we investigate the bifurcations and dynamical transitions induced by time-varying diffusive and periodic coupling functions. We studied the transitions between oscillation quenching states induced by the time-varying form of the coupling function while the coupling strength is kept invariant. The time-varying periodic coupling function allowed us to identify novel, non-trivial inhomogeneous states that have not been reported previously. Furthermore, by using dynamical Bayesian inference we have also developed a Proportional Integral (PI) controller that maintains the oscillations and \red{prevents oscillation quenching from occurring}. In addition to the present implementation and its generalizations, the framework carries broader implications for identification and control of oscillation quenching in a wide range of systems subjected to time-varying interactions.

TL;DR: A unified workflow for computing Helmholtz free-energy surfaces from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression with quantum corrections, applicable to both solids and liquids with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing free-energy calculation methods have limitations: phonon approaches neglect anharmonicity and liquids, while MD is computationally expensive and lacks quantum effects at low temperatures.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process Regression on MD data to reconstruct free-energy surfaces, adds zero-point energy corrections from harmonic theory, employs active learning for optimal sampling, and propagates statistical uncertainties.

Result: Successfully computed thermodynamic properties (heat capacities, thermal expansion, bulk moduli, melting properties) for 9 FCC/BCC metals using 20 interatomic potentials, all with confidence intervals.

Conclusion: The automated, general, and uncertainty-aware workflow enables high-throughput thermodynamics and provides systematic benchmarking for interatomic potentials.

Abstract: Accurate free-energy calculations are essential for predicting thermodynamic properties and phase stability, but existing methods are limited: phonon-based approaches neglect anharmonicity and liquids, while molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding, neglects low-temperature quantum effects, and often requires manual planning and post-processing of simulations. We present a unified workflow that reconstructs the Helmholtz free-energy surface from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with zero-point energy corrections from harmonic/quasi-harmonic theory. The framework propagates statistical uncertainties, mitigates finite-size effects, and employs active learning to optimize sampling in the volume-temperature space. It applies seamlessly to both crystalline and liquid phases. We demonstrate the methodology by computing heat capacities, thermal expansion, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, and melting properties for nine elemental FCC and BCC metals using 20 classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials, with all predictions accompanied by quantified confidence intervals. Automated, general, and uncertainty-aware, the workflow advances high-throughput thermodynamics and provides a systematic benchmark for interatomic potentials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XPINN framework solves nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation by dynamically decomposing domain into pre-shock and post-shock regions, using localized subnetworks with Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition coupling to capture discontinuities without artificial diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions in hyperbolic PDEs. The Buckley-Leverett equation with nonconvex flux presents particular challenges for conventional solvers.

Method: Extended PINN (XPINN) with dynamic domain decomposition into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions. Localized subnetworks learn distinct flow behaviors, coupled via Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition for flux continuity across moving shock interfaces.

Result: XPINN accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution compared to standard PINNs using smaller models with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: XPINN is an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems, offering improved performance over standard PINNs for problems with discontinuities and complex wave dynamics.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code of this work is available on github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.

TL;DR: Introduces an irreversibility-regularized strategy for PINNs that enforces the Second Law of Thermodynamics as soft constraints during training, significantly improving accuracy across various physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PINNs often neglect the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, leading to unphysical solutions or training failures.

Method: A simple, generalized irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during PINN training.

Result: Reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude across benchmarks including traveling wave propagation, combustion, ice melting, corrosion, and crack propagation.

Conclusion: The framework is broadly applicable to PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MiAD introduces mirage infusion to enable diffusion models to change atom states (existent/non-existent), improving S.U.N. crystal generation by 2.5x and achieving 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for crystal generation cannot change the number of atoms during generation, limiting sampling variability and model performance.

Method: Mirage infusion technique that allows diffusion models to toggle atom states between existent and non-existent, implemented in Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD) - an equivariant joint diffusion model.

Result: 2.5x improvement in model quality compared to unmodified models; achieves 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20 dataset, substantially exceeding state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Mirage infusion enables more flexible crystal generation by allowing atom count changes, significantly improving diffusion model performance for de novo crystal design.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: To address the curse of dimensionality in learning multidimensional random field models from limited data, and to improve the training of stochastic neural networks for uncertainty quantification tasks.

Method: Proves generalization error bounds for SNNs, improves previous Wasserstein-distance training approach, and conducts numerical experiments on multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks.

Result: When noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, convergence rate may not explicitly depend on model dimensionality, partially alleviating curse of dimensionality. Approach successfully trains SNNs for multidimensional uncertainty models.

Conclusion: Wasserstein-distance approach enables effective training of stochastic neural networks for multidimensional random field reconstruction, with improved generalization bounds that mitigate dimensionality challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADATG: Adaptive two-grid foundation model with Hilbert encoding for seismic data that separates high/low frequencies and uses progressive training from coarse to fine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision transformers fail to effectively capture both high- and low-frequency seismic information due to sequential tokenization ignoring intrinsic patterns in seismic data.

Method: Uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components, hierarchical Hilbert encoding, and adaptive training strategy that starts with coarse-level information then refines to fine-level features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the training methods for seismic foundation models.

Conclusion: Highlights importance of data encoding and training strategies tailored to seismic data's distinct frequency characteristics for enhancing visual seismic foundation models.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

Conclusion: Convex relaxations provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional optimal transport, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool in mathematics and data science but faces severe computational and statistical challenges in high dimensions. We propose convex relaxation approaches based on marginal and cluster moment relaxations that exploit locality and correlative sparsity in the distributions. These methods approximate high-dimensional couplings using low-order marginals and sparse moment statistics, yielding semidefinite programs that provide lower bounds on the OT cost with greatly reduced complexity. For Gaussian distributions with sparse correlations, we prove reductions in both computational and sample complexity, and experiments show the approach also works well for non-Gaussian cases. In addition, we demonstrate how to extract transport maps from our relaxations, offering a simpler and interpretable alternative to neural networks in generative modeling. Our results suggest that convex relaxations can provide a promising path for dimension reduction in high-dimensional OT.

Conclusion: APF-FNNs establish a powerful and versatile foundation for physics-driven computational design through their unified framework that combines neural networks with physics principles and regularization.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified and physics-driven framework of alternating phase-field Fourier neural networks (APF-FNNs) for topology optimization. At its core, an alternating architecture decouples the optimization by parameterizing the state, adjoint and topology fields with three distinct Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs). These networks are trained through a collaborative and stable alternating optimization scheme applicable to both self-adjoint and non-self-adjoint systems. The Ginzburg-Landau energy functional is incorporated into the topology network's loss function, acting as an intrinsic regularizer that promotes well-defined designs with smooth and distinct interfaces. By employing physics-informed losses derived from either variational principles or strong-form PDE residuals, the broad applicability of the APF-FNNs is demonstrated across a spectrum of 2D and 3D multi-physics benchmarks, including compliance minimization, eigenvalue maximization, and Stokes/Navier-Stokes flow optimization. The proposed APF-FNNs consistently yield high-performance and high-resolution topologies, establishing a powerful and versatile foundation for physics-driven computational design.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Detection of rapid downflows (150-217 km/s) in solar flare ribbon plasma showing two distinct stages: initial chromospheric condensations from impulsive energy release, followed by flare-induced coronal rain, with persistent ~50s quasi-periodic pulsations throughout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms driving rapid downflows in solar flare ribbons and investigate their relationship with energy release processes and magnetic field dynamics.

Method: Used IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements, ASO-S/HXI hard X-ray imaging, LYRA Lyman-alpha measurements, hard X-ray spectral analysis, and machine learning K-means clustering for line profile analysis.

Result: Identified two distinct downflow stages: Stage 1 (max 176 km/s) synchronized with HXR/Lyman-alpha peaks from chromospheric condensations; Stage 2 (max 217 km/s) persisting after energy release ends, attributed to flare-induced coronal rain. Both stages showed ~50s quasi-periodic pulsations.

Conclusion: Multiple mechanisms drive flare ribbon downflows - chromospheric condensations during impulsive energy release and flare-induced coronal rain later. The persistent ~50s pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade, independent of loop length.

Abstract: We detect rapid downflows of 150-217 km/s in IRIS Si IV 1402.77 nm measurements of an X9-class solar flare on 2024 October 3rd. The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: In non-uniform plasmas, MHD waves lose their clear distinction between Alfvén waves (incompressible, magnetic tension-driven) and magneto-sonic waves (compressible, pressure-driven), allowing waves to exhibit hybrid properties in different regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how plasma non-uniformity affects the fundamental properties and classification of MHD waves, which behave distinctly differently in uniform versus non-uniform environments.

Method: Theoretical analysis of MHD wave behavior in non-uniform plasma environments, comparing properties with the well-established behavior in uniform plasmas.

Result: In non-uniform plasmas, MHD waves can exhibit hybrid characteristics - appearing as magneto-sonic waves in some regions and Alfvén waves in others, with Alfvén waves even showing pressure variations contrary to their behavior in uniform plasmas.

Conclusion: Plasma non-uniformity fundamentally alters MHD wave behavior, breaking down the traditional clear distinction between Alfvén and magneto-sonic waves and enabling waves to display properties of both types depending on their location in the equilibrium.

Abstract: Non-uniformity plays an important role for MHD waves. For a uniform plasma of infinite extent the MHD waves can be subdivided in two classes with distinct properties. The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.

Result: The analysis reveals the complementary nature of different formation mechanisms and their potential coexistence in prominence mass formation and maintenance, with significant progress in numerical modeling of evaporation-condensation and in-situ condensation processes.

Conclusion: While substantial progress has been made in understanding prominence formation through multi-scale physical processes, open questions remain about connecting these mechanisms to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors, highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex dynamics of compound vesicles (modeling leukocytes or nucleate cells) under shear flow confinement, extending beyond single vesicle behavior and matching experimental observations.

Method: 2D model combining molecular dynamics and mesoscopic hydrodynamics with thermal fluctuations, varying swelling degree, relative vesicle sizes, fluid viscosities, and Capillary number.

Result: Observed rich dynamical states where inner and outer vesicles perform different motions; thermal fluctuations crucial for trembling/swinging; undulating motion with periodic oscillation and membrane buckling at high filling fractions.

Conclusion: Compound vesicles exhibit complex dynamics dependent on relative size, swelling degree, and thermal noise, showing features missing in previous analytical/numerical studies and matching experimental findings.

Abstract: We report a numerical study addressing the dynamics of compound vesicles confined in a channel under shear flow. The system comprises a smaller vesicle embedded within a larger one and can be used to mimic, for example, leukocytes or nucleate cells. A two-dimensional model, which combines molecular dynamics and mesoscopic hydrodynamics including thermal fluctuations, is adopted to perform an extended investigation. We are able to vary independently the swelling degree and the relative size of vesicles, the viscosities of fluids internal and external to vesicles, and the Capillary number, so to observe a rich dynamical phenomenology which goes well beyond what observed for single vesicles, matching quantitatively with experimental findings. Tank-treading, tumbling, and trembling motions are enriched by dynamical states where inner and outer vesicles can perform different motions. We show that thermal fluctuations are crucial during trembling and swinging dynamics, as observed in experiments. Undulating motion of the external vesicle, characterized by periodic oscillation of the inclination and buckling of the membrane, is observed at high filling fractions. This latter state exhibits features that are shown to depend on the relative size, the swelling degree of both vesicles as well as on thermal noise lacking in previous analytical and numerical studies.

Motivation: To understand how particle inertia affects transport characteristics of active Brownian particles in microfluidic channels under flow, which is relevant for natural and artificial environments.

Method: Investigation of inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under Poiseuille flow, analyzing interplay between particle inertia and fluid flow.

Result: Overdamped particles exhibit negative average velocity (upstream movement); increasing mass leads to positive velocity with maximum at optimal mass; effective diffusion coefficient peaks at optimal mass; self-propelled velocity enhances upstream movement; rotation rate enhances diffusion at higher masses.

Conclusion: Inertia modifies swimmer-flow interactions and enables new dynamical regimes where mass-dependent trajectories can be used for selective control and mass-based particle separation in engineered environments and lab-on-a-chip devices.

Abstract: The diffusive behavior of small entities is strongly influenced by the flow of the surrounding medium, which is ubiquitous in natural and artificial environments. In this study, we investigate the transport characteristics of the inertial active Brownian particles (ABPs) in a microfluidic channel under a Poiseuille flow. The interplay between the inertia of the particles and the imposed fluid flow leads to interesting diffusive behaviors. For instance, in the overdamped regime ($m \to 0$), particles exhibit a negative average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ due to upstream movement. As $m$ increases, particles tend to move along the flow direction with an increase in $\langle v \rangle$ in the positive direction, exhibiting a maximum at optimal $m$, and diminish for higher $m$ values. The effective diffusion coefficient $D_{eff}$ also shows a peak at this optimal $m$. Interestingly, at higher $m$ values, $D_{eff}$ decreases with increasing the noise strength. The self-propelled velocity of the particles further enhances the upstream movement. Further, the rotation rate of the particles also contributes positively to the upstream motion, and enhances the diffusion of the particles by many orders in the limit of higher $m$. This study reveals that inertia not only modifies swimmer flow interactions but also enables new dynamical regimes, where mass-dependent trajectories can be harnessed for selective control. Such control holds promise for mass based particle separation in precisely engineered environments and lab on a chip devices for technological applications.

### [52] [Computational study of irrational rotations via exact discontinuity tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13879)
*Hannah Kravitz*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: A novel O(N) algorithm computes the discrepancy sum D_N(x,ρ) for irrational rotations to machine precision, enabling exact calculation of its probability density function and key statistical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing the exact value of discrepancy sum D_N(x,ρ) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability and failure of sampling methods to capture jump discontinuities, making stable computation necessary for forming conjectures.

Method: The paper presents a computational algorithm that defines the discrepancy function and its pdf through discontinuities, allowing machine-precision calculation in O(N) time with minimal storage.

Result: The algorithm enables direct computation of exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, revealing key properties: support range, variance, and kurtosis. A new conjectured pattern is presented showing predictable spiked-trapezoidal pdf patterns.

Conclusion: The algorithm's ability to produce exact figures allows development of mathematical intuition and quick testing of conjectures, representing a vast improvement over the O(N²) naive approach.

Abstract: The discrepancy sum $D_N(x,ρ)$ for irrational rotations has been of interest to mathematicians for over a century. While historically studied in an ``almost-everywhere'' or asymptotic sense, $D_N$ for finite N is increasingly an object of interest for its nontrivial properties that depend on the Diophantine properties of $ρ$. This behavior is periodic in N with respect to the quotients of the continued fraction convergents, which grow quickly for some irrationals. Thus the stable computation of the sum is necessary for forming conjectures about its properties. However, computing the exact value of the sum and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability in the sum itself and the failure of sampling methods to capture its jump discontinuities. This paper presents a novel computational algorithm that fully defines the discrepancy function and its associated pdf through its discontinuities. This allows the calculation of $D_N(x,ρ)$ to machine precision with minimal storage in O(N) time. This vast improvement in computability over the O(N^2) naive version enables, for the first time, the direct computation of the exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, and with it, key properties of the discrepancy: $ \|D_N \|_{\infty}$ (half of the support of the pdf), $ \|D_N \|_{2}^2$ (the variance of the pdf), and the kurtosis of the pdf. A key strength of the algorithm lies in its ability to produce clear, exact figures, allowing the development of mathematical intuition and the quick testing of conjectures. As an example, a newly conjectured pattern is presented: when $ρ$ is well-approximated by rational $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, the pdf exhibits a predictable spiked-trapezoidal pattern when $N=kq_n$. These shapes degrade as $k$ increases, at a speed depending on how well $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ approximates $ρ$.
