The method, referred to as the Adaptive Ch Method, automatically prioritizes adjusting the local cover size C then refines local nodal spacing h to achieve a prescribed tolerance. Numerical examples for one- and two-dimensional Poisson problems demonstrate accurate solutions across a wide range of shape parameter values, while preserving the advantages of local collocation. The proposed approximation approach is truly meshless, requiring no element, connectivity or continuity to construct trial functions or weights."}

Mathematically, this corresponds to recovering the coefficients of a damped wave operator, or equivalently, a quadratic operator pencil in the frequency domain.\n  The Lippmann-Schwinger equation maps the unknown reflectivity and loss distribution to the measured scattered data. This mapping is nonlinear, as it requires knowledge of the internal wavefield, which itself depends on the reflectivity and loss distribution. The Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos method addresses this nonlinearity by approximating the internal solutions through the lifting of states from a reduced-order model constructed directly from the measured data.\n  In this work, we extend the method to dissipative problems, enabling the approximation of internal partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in media with both reflectivity and loss distributions. We present two complementary constructions of such internal solutions: one based on spectral data and another on frequency-domain measurements over a finite interval. This development establishes a direct link between data-driven reduced-order models for inverse problems and port-Hamiltonian dynamical systems, with reduced models obtained either from the associated spectral measure or via rational approximation. Compared to the Born approximation, which replaces the internal field with the background field, our approach yields more accurate internal reconstructions and enables faster and more robust recovery of the contrast as evidenced by our numerical experiments."}

When $0<\\varepsilon\\ll 1$, the rapidly oscillatory solution constrains the step size selection and numerical accuracy, resulting in significant computational challenges. Motivated by linearization through introducing auxiliary polynomial variables, a new class of explicit exponential integrators (EIs) has recently been developed. The methods do not require the linear part to be diagonal or with all eigenvalues to be integer multiples of a fixed value - a general assumption in multiscale methods - and attain arbitrarily high convergence order without any order conditions. The main contribution of this work is to establish a rigorous error analysis for the new class of methods. To do this, we first demonstrate the equivalence between the high-dimensional system and the original problem by employing algebraic techniques. Building upon these fundamental results, we prove that the numerical schemes have a uniform convergence order of $O(h^{k+1})$ for the solution when using at most $k$-degree auxiliary polynomial variables with time step sizes smaller than $\\varepsilon$. For larger step sizes under the bounded oscillatory energy condition, the methods achieve a convergence order of $O(\\varepsilon h^k)$ for the solution. These theoretical results are further applied to second-order oscillatory equations, yielding improved uniform accuracy with respect to $\\varepsilon$. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the optimality of the derived error estimates."}

Specifically, PAS-Net augments the trunk input in the physics informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) with a prescribed (or learnable) locally rescaled coordinate transformation centered at reference points. This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework. We test the proposed PAS-Net on three different problems: (i) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, (ii) a nonlinear diffusion-reaction system with sharp spatial gradients, and (iii) a two-dimensional eikonal equation.

In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples."}

At the plasma edge, the EXB shear flow collapses while turbulence transport and spreading enhances significantly when approaching the density limit. The heat flux width increases with normalized density. An energy production ratio model is used to quantify the contribution of edge turbulence spreading to the origin of the SOL turbulence. Experimental data show that the energy production ratio is much larger than 1, indicating that turbulence spreading at separatrix is the origin of the SOL turbulence. The heat flux widths increase with edge turbulence spreading as well as the energy production ratio. The impact of blob-induced transport on the heat flux width is investigated in detail. Especially, the average blob-induced spreading is about 81% of the total edge spreading in the high-density scenario. Blobs with larger radial scales enhance edge spreading into the SOL, thus dominating the SOL turbulence and consequently broadening the heat flux width. These results suggest that edge turbulence spreading plays a crucial role in broadening the heat flux width as plasma approaches the density limit."}

We perform two sets of coil current scans: (1) scans where each coil current is varied individually, using the \"standard\", \"high iota\" and \"low iota\" configurations as starting points; (2) a scan of over 200,000 magnetic configurations in which the coil currents are randomly sampled. In both cases we constrain the coil currents to the normal range of W7-X. We verify the principal roles of the non-planar, planar and control coils: the non-planar coils establish island chains with a certain phase; the planar coils modify the location of the island chain by both controlling the iota profile and shifting the configuration \"inward\" and \"outward\"; the control coil affects the island size and phase. We also find that |Tr(M)-2| (a quantity closely related to the magnitude of the Greene's residue) tends to increase with the minor radius of the fixed points, and that Tr(M) for X- and O-points can be very differently affected by the control coil current.

While traditional blanket modeling of liquid metal flows during normal steady operating conditions commonly employs the inductionless approximation of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, transient scenarios, when the plasma-confining magnetic field varies on millisecond time scales, require a full-induction MHD approach that dynamically evolves the magnetic field via the time-dependent induction equation. This paper presents the formulation, implementation, and initial verification of a full-induction MHD solver integrated within the open-source Vertex-CFD framework, which aims to achieve tight multiphysics coupling, a flexible software design enabling easy extension and addition of physics models, and performance portability across computing platforms. The solver utilizes finite element spatial discretization, implicit Runge--Kutta time integration, and an inexact Newton method to solve the resulting discrete nonlinear system, leveraging Trilinos packages for efficient computation. Verification against selected benchmark problems demonstrates accuracy and robustness of the solver. Furthermore, when the solver is applied to an idealized blanket model in 2.5D and full 3D, results obtained with Vertex-CFD are in good agreement with recently published quasi-2D simulations.

Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios."}

The behavior of roots of the orthogonal Müntz polynomial has also been observed for its application as nodes in the fractional quadrature rule. To illustrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed fractional quadrature rule, we focus on fractional differential equations that incorporate the left Caputo fractional derivative. In this context, Müntz-Legendre scaling functions are utilized to approximate the Caputo derivative of functions involved in these equations. Additionally, we have derived an operational matrix for Riemann-Liouville integration to approximate the respective functions with the help of the fractional quadrature rule. To demonstrate the practical utility of our method, we provide illustrative examples that compare the $L_2$-error estimates in the solutions of fractional differential equations using our approach against those obtained with the Block-pulse method. These comparisons underscore the superior accuracy of our proposed method."}

In their classical work (Lou-Ni, 1999), it was shown that, under the limit where one cross-diffusion parameter tends to infinity, coexistence steady states of the SKT model are characterized by three types of shadow systems. In a previous study (Kuto, 2015), the first author analyzed one of these shadow systems in one space dimension (the second shadow system) and proved that a component of a bifurcating branch blows up as the bifurcation parameter approaches the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of $-Δ$. In the present paper, using a new approach based on suitable transformations and the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we derive the existence and detailed asymptotic structure of several branches of positive steady states near blow-up points for shadow systems with one or two cross-diffusion terms, in both one- and multi-dimensional domains. We further show that all such large-amplitude steady state branches are spectrally unstable. Moreover, by means of perturbation arguments, we establish the existence and instability of corresponding branches of perturbed positive steady states for the original SKT model when one cross-diffusion coefficient is sufficiently large."}

Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere."}

Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($α= 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity.

These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm. Code Availability: https://github.com/maxhirsch/Efficient-NTK"}

Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms.

Specifically, PAS-Net augments the trunk input in the physics informed Deep Operator Network (PI-DeepONet) with a prescribed (or learnable) locally rescaled coordinate transformation centered at reference points. This addition introduces a multiscale feature embedding that acts as an architecture-independent preconditioner which improves the representation of localized, stiff, and multiscale dynamics. From an optimization perspective, the adaptive-scale embedding in PAS-Net modifies the geometry of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the neural network by increasing its smallest eigenvalue, which in turn improves spectral conditioning and accelerates gradient-based convergence. We further show that this adaptive-scale mechanism explicitly accelerates neural network training in approximating functions with steep transitions and strong asymptotic behavior, and we provide a rigorous proof of this function-approximation result within the finite-dimensional NTK matrix framework. We test the proposed PAS-Net on three different problems: (i) the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, (ii) a nonlinear diffusion-reaction system with sharp spatial gradients, and (iii) a two-dimensional eikonal equation. The numerical results show that PAS-Net consistently achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than the standard DeepONet and PI-DeepONet models under a similar training cost."}

This classical result coined the term Tchakaloff quadrature for quadrature that is exact and only uses non-negative weights. It has been a long-standing endeavor, under which conditions such rules exist. A final answer was given in 2012 by Bisgaard with the insight that, in fact, every finite-dimensional space of integrable functions on a positive measure space admits them. In this article we recall this result and provide a major extension to the question of positive discretizability of $\\mathbb{C}$-linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces. We introduce the notion of strict $S$-positivity for such functionals, where $S$ are subsets of the functional's domain, and show the equivalence of positive discretizability to being strictly $S$-positive for a suitable choice of $S$. We further investigate consequences for other discretization problems. One fundamental implication is the guaranteed existence of $L_p$-Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund equalities in finite-dimensional spaces of $p$-integrable functions in case that $p$ is an even integer, another the exact discretizability of any frame in $\\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\\mathbb{K}\\in\\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\}$, if a rescaling of the frame elements is allowed.

By analyzing Riemann solutions at fixed observation times, we develop explicit reconstruction formulas that handle arbitrary combinations of shock and rarefaction waves through a unified equivalent shock concept. Our method constructs piecewise quadratic $C^1$ flux approximations with rigorous convergence guarantees: the approximation errors decrease quadratically with the discretization parameters for function values and linearly for derivatives under $C^{1,1}$ regularity, with enhanced cubic and quadratic convergence respectively under $C^3$ regularity. Applications to the isentropic Euler equations and the mathematically equivalent p-system in compressible fluid dynamics demonstrate the method's capability to identify complete equations of state from limited dynamic measurements, providing a systematic approach to a fundamental inverse problem in continuum mechanics."}

Furthermore, we derive both existence and nonexistence results for the zero-mass case $λ= 0$, highlighting the role of the mixed diffusion in determining the qualitative behavior of solutions. Specifically, this paper's novelty lies in providing a comprehensive understanding of the intermediate cases that arise when the non-homogeneous $(2,q)$-Laplacian operator appears.

We don't know of any such sharp and detailed description otherwise, which is our motivation to look for a new approach to the problem. The underlying idea is to describe solutions of Gelfand problems via suitably defined constrained problems of free boundary-type arising in plasma physics and to replace the usual $L^\\infty$ norm of the solution with the energy of the plasma. Toward this goal, we first solve a long standing open problem of independent interest about the uniqueness of solutions of Grad-Shafranov type equations. Thus, we exploit these unique solutions to detect a curve containing both minimal and non minimal solutions of the associated Gelfand problem. In other words we come up with a new global parametrization of the Rabinowitz continuum, the monotonicity of the energy along the branch providing a meaningful generalization of the classical pointwise monotonicity property of minimal solutions, suitable to describe non minimal solutions as well. On a ball in any dimension, we come up as expected with a bell-shaped profile of the full branch of solutions of the Gelfand problem."}

The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium. Previous works have shown that optimal resources are bang-bang, and in one dimension, a sufficiently large dispersal rate forces the optimal resource to be concentrated. For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population. This function also allows us to reformulate the optimization problem as a convexity analysis of the advantage function. We prove the superlinearity of this function when the total resource is small enough, and this property leads to an explicit characterization of the optimal control with sufficiently small total resource."}

Generic perturbations generate diffusion waves, and structural conditions fail for multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates. These two aspects have posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since \\cite{LX}, the study of the entropy wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-order terms become too slow to close the {\\it a priori} assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system. Additionally, using the fact that the derivative of the entropy wave maintains a fixed sign, we employ well-designed weighted energy estimates to control the slowly decaying terms. This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate. Furthermore, we address the case of initial perturbations with the zero mass condition and obtain the optimal decay rate by additionally developing a Poincaré type inequality and a key cancellation."}

The proposed approach comprises a system of integro-differential equations for the statistical distributions, over a large patient cohort, of the densities of muscle fibers and immune cells implicated in muscle inflammation, degeneration, and regeneration, which underpin disease development. Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations. The modeling approach presented here has the potential to offer new insights into the balance between degeneration and regeneration mechanisms in the progression of muscular dystrophies, and provides a basis for future extensions, including the modeling of therapeutic interventions."}

While previous work has linked DDI to instability in the purely nondiffusive subsystem -- thereby destabilizing all regular Turing patterns -- we show that DDI can also arise from subsystems involving nondiffusive and slow-diffusive components. This leads to simple sufficient conditions for DDI in systems with arbitrary numbers of components. Further, we fully classify all possible sources of DDI in the case of two diffusive and one nondiffusive component, illustrating our results with a receptor-based model supported by numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of pattern formation, demonstrating how coupling between diffusive and nondiffusive dynamics can generate patterns beyond the reach of the classical reaction-diffusion framework."}

Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \\emph{modified} energy \\[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \\fracη{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,ρ(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \\textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyv{ä}rinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \\emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples.
