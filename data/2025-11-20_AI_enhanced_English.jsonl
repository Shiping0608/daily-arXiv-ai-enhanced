This mapping is nonlinear, as it requires knowledge of the internal wavefield, which itself depends on the reflectivity and loss distribution. The Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos method addresses this nonlinearity by approximating the internal solutions through the lifting of states from a reduced-order model constructed directly from the measured data.\n  In this work, we extend the method to dissipative problems, enabling the approximation of internal partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in media with both reflectivity and loss distributions. We present two complementary constructions of such internal solutions: one based on spectral data and another on frequency-domain measurements over a finite interval.

Motivated by linearization through introducing auxiliary polynomial variables, a new class of explicit exponential integrators (EIs) has recently been developed.

The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium.

For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population.
