Motivated by the requirements of the OpInf methodology, we reformulate the matrix equations into a structured representation that explicitly shows the parameter dependence in polynomial form. This reformulation is crucial for efficient model reduction. This approach constructs reduced-order models via regression on solution snapshots, bypassing the need for expensive full-order operators and thus overcoming the primary bottlenecks of intrusive methods in high-dimensional contexts. Numerical experiments confirm their accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating that our work is a scalable and practical solution for parameter-dependent matrix equations."}

Within this framework, the number of neurons serves as both the regularization parameter and iteration number. We demonstrate that for data with high noise levels, a small network architecture is sufficient to obtain a stable solution, whereas a larger architecture may compromise stability due to overfitting. Furthermore, under standard assumptions in regularization theory, we derive convergence rate results for neural networks in the context of variational regularization. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the robustness of the proposed neural network-based algorithms."}

This is accomplished by first re-writing the XMHD equations such that it allows the algorithm to retain the use of ideal MHD Riemann solvers and the constrained transport method to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. Incorporation of electron inertia and displacement current introduces additional numerical stiffness which motivates a semi-implicit FV scheme that re-formulates the XMHD model as a relaxation system. The equations are then advanced in time using an explicit 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme with operator splitting applied to the implicit source term updates at each sub-stage. For additional numerical stability, density-dependent slope limiter is implemented to increase flux diffusivity at low density where non-ideal effects become significant. The algorithm is subsequently implemented on Artemis, a multifluid radiation hydrodynamics code built on Parthenon framework for high-performance computing (HPC) and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) support. As the new algorithm retains many aspects of the ideal MHD formulations, it asymptotes naturally to the ideal MHD limit. Moreover, it shows promising results at the resistive and Hall MHD limits. This is verified against published test problems for ideal, resistive and Hall MHD."}

The method is motivated by the dynamics of non-Newtonian mechanical systems, where conventional momentum schemes can be interpreted as a dynamical model with quadratic kinetic energy and linear damping. Based on this analogy, a generalized optimization dynamics is constructed by extending the kinetic energy formulation and incorporating a nonlinear damping term. An anharmonic kinetic energy function can be employed to represent the inertial effect of accumulated gradient information during the iterations, while the nonlinear damping mechanism enables a more flexible control of the momentum contribution along the convergence trajectory. Numerical experiments indicate that the method exhibits faster convergence and higher robustness compared to classical momentum algorithms. Moreover, its strong performance on nonconvex objectives makes it particularly suitable for inverse photonic design problems. The results suggest that dynamical systems from physics can provide a view towards the development of efficient optimization methods."}

People often perform this task intuitively, relying on common sense or practical experience, while information theory and computer science offer computable metrics for this purpose. In this study, we assess the applicability of metrics based on information compression and the Silhouette coefficient for quantifying numerical data. We also investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with one another and with what is commonly referred to as \"human intuition.\" Our findings suggest that the ability to classify numeric data values into distinct categories is associated with a Silhouette coefficient above 0.65 and a Dip Test below 0.5; otherwise, the data can be treated as following a unimodal normal distribution.

One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.\n  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.\n  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.\n  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool."}

This framework divides the reconstruction process into two dedicated branches for each neutrino event topology --tracks and showers-- composed of sub-models for spatial estimation --direction and position-- and energy inference, which later on are combined for event classification. Regarding the direction of single-line events, the $N$-Fit algorithm significantly refines the estimation of the zenithal angle, and delivers reliable azimuthal angle predictions that were previously unattainable with traditional $χ^2$-fit methods. Improving on energy estimation of single-line events is a tall order; $N$-Fit benefits from transfer learning to efficiently integrate key characteristics, such as the estimation of the closest distance from the event to the detector. $N$-Fit also takes advantage from transfer learning in event topology classification by freezing convolutional layers of the pretrained branches.

To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency.

One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.\n  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.\n  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.\n  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool."}

The model builds on the building-block flow principle, leveraging essential physics from simple flows to train a generalizable model applicable across complex geometries and flow conditions. The model addresses key limitations of traditional equilibrium wall models (EQWM) and improves upon shortcomings of earlier building-block-based approaches. The model comprises four components: (i) a baseline wall model, (ii) an error model, (iii) a classifier, and (iv) a confidence score. The baseline model predicts the wall-shear stress, while the error model estimates epistemic errors and aleatoric errors, both used for uncertainty quantification. In Part I of this work, we present the baseline model, while the remaining three components are introduced in Part II. The baseline model is designed to capture a broad range of flow phenomena, including turbulence over curved walls and zero, adverse, and favorable mean pressure gradients, as well as flow separation and laminar flow. The problem is formulated as a regression task to predict wall shear stress using a neural network. Model inputs are localized in space and dimensionless, with their selection guided by information-theoretic criteria. Training data include, among other cases, a newly generated direct numerical simulation dataset of turbulent boundary layers under favorable and adverse PG conditions. Validation is carried out through both a priori and a posteriori tests. The a priori evaluation spans 140 diverse high-fidelity numerical datasets and experiments (67 training cases included), covering turbulent boundary layers, airfoils, Gaussian bumps, and full aircraft geometries, among others. We demonstrate that the baseline wall model outperforms the EQWM in 90% of test scenarios, while maintaining errors below 20% for 98% of the cases."}

This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work."}

Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution."}

We first analyze the long-term behavior of the system, showing that it follows a spreading-vanishing dichotomy: the two species either spread across the entire region or eventually die out. In the case of spreading, we determine the asymptotic spreading speed of the fronts by using a semi-wave system and provide sharp estimates for the moving fronts. Additionally, we show that the solution to the system converges to the corresponding semi-wave solution as time tends to infinity. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of cooperative species in reaction-diffusion systems with free boundaries."}

We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.\n  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data."}
