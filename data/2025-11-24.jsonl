Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D."}

For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \\(S_N\\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.\n  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \\(N_{s}\\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \\(S_N\\) solve; \\(N_s=0\\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \\(N_s>0\\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.\n  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves.

For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel."}

John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $π/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally."}

This dissertation studies the particle size, and growth time with and without a background magnetic field in the plasma. Traditionally, studies have focused on the growth of either carbonaceous or silicate dust from either acetylene or silane, respectively. However, recently, there have been a shift towards studying new kinds of dust. For example, recent studies have grown polymers and metallic dust. This dissertation first introduces and studies the growth of titanium dioxide dust from the metal-organic vapor precursor of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The as-grown materials are amorphous but high temperature annealing crystallizes the samples into anatase and subsequently rutile. Then, the growth of titania dusty plasma is and compared to the growth of carbonaceous dust from acetylene, in argon plasma. They are grown during the presence and absence of weak magnetic fields of 500 Gauss. Both kinds of dust growth exhibit a growth cycle, which had already been shown for various nano dusty plasma. This occurs because once the dust accumulates a critical radius and mass, they move away from the central region of the plasma, allowing a new generation of growth begins. Ultimately, the new generation of growth also moves away leading to a continuous cycle of particle formation and transport as long as the plasma is on. However, with the presence of the magnetic field, the cycle time decreases, and the spatial distribution of the dust cloud appears differently. Finally, we focus on the growth cycle time of carbonaceous dust and how it decreases with a gradual increase in magnetic field, varying from 20 - 1000 Gauss. We particularly noticed a minimum at 330 Gauss, which coincides with electron magnetization."}

We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux.

Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility. Physically informed priors, including range-invariant, stress-based parameter priors, a model-redundancy prior, and a Bayesian Information Criterion motivated model prior, penalize complex models to enforce Occam's razor. Using a precomputed grid of simulations, the probabilistic model selection process enables an initial guess for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) material parameter values. Synthetic tests recover the ground-truth models and expected parameters. Using experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose, MAP simulations of credible models reproduce the data.

To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method.

In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures."}

We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application."}

This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift."}

This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper."}

The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting.

The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows."}

These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schrödinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation."}

Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.\n  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed."}
