### [1] [Vanka-smoothed shifted Laplacian multigrid preconditioners for the Helmholtz equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16808)
*Rachel Yovel,Yunhui He,Eran Treister*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Improved multigrid preconditioner for acoustic Helmholtz equation using additive Vanka smoother with lower complex shift, enabling scalable deep V-cycles for high-frequency problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multigrid fails for Helmholtz equation, and existing complex shifted Laplacian method requires large shifts that interfere with scalability as frequency increases.

Method: Developed additive Vanka smoother requiring lower complex shift, combined with carefully designed multigrid cycle components to enable deep V-cycles with bounded shift.

Result: Method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in runtime, performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D, validated by local Fourier analysis and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides enhanced scalability for Helmholtz problems by enabling deep multigrid cycles with small, bounded complex shifts even at high frequencies.

Abstract: We present an improved multigrid preconditioner for the acoustic Helmholtz equation with enhanced scalability. Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D.

### [2] [Scatter-Limited Hybrid Monte Carlo, Deterministic Transport with Quasi-Monte Carlo Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16821)
*Johannes Krotz,Ryan G. McClarren*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Hybrid method combining Monte Carlo with deterministic discrete ordinates for time-dependent particle transport, using quasi-Monte Carlo sampling for improved accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and accurate particle transport method by hybridizing Monte Carlo estimation with deterministic solves, leveraging the strengths of both approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Combines MC estimation with deterministic S_N solve using bilinear discontinuous finite elements. Uses tunable parameter N_s to control material collisions handled in MC leg before switching to deterministic solve. Implements quasi-Monte Carlo sampling instead of pseudorandom draws.

Result: Significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements with quasi-Monte Carlo sampling at practically no additional computational cost. Multi-scatter approach provides flexibility in parallelization and deterministic solver choice.

Conclusion: The hybrid method successfully combines Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches, with quasi-Monte Carlo sampling providing substantial benefits in accuracy and convergence without increasing computational cost.

Abstract: We present a hybrid method for time-dependent particle transport that combines Monte Carlo (MC) estimation with a deterministic discrete ordinates (\(S_N\)) solve, augmented by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \(S_N\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.
  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \(N_{s}\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \(S_N\) solve; \(N_s=0\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \(N_s>0\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.
  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver.

Abstract: This paper develops a robust solver for the Maxwell eigenproblem in 3D photonic crystals (PCs) with pseudochiral media. The solver employs the Kernel Compensation technique under the framework of Yee's scheme to eliminate null space and enable matrix-free, GPU-accelerated operations via 3D discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Furthermore, we propose a novel discretization for permittivity tensor containing off-diagonal entries and rigorously prove that the resulting matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), which ensures the correctness of the kernel compensation technique. Numerical experiments on several benchmark examples are demonstrated to validate the robustness and accuracy of our scheme.

Conclusion: The proposed quartic/linear interpolation kernels provide superior performance compared to traditional cubic interpolation, with one particular kernel showing the best results across multiple image quality metrics.

Abstract: We study the constructions of piecewise rational interpolation kernels that are supported on the interval $[-2,2]$, and present one novel rational cubic/linear and five quartic/linear interpolation kernels. All proposed kernels are symmetric, $C^1$ continuous, and possess certain degrees of approximation order. The proposed quartic/linear interpolation kernels include the cubic and the cubic/linear interpolation kernel as special cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve nonlinear systems arising from hp-finite element discretizations in solid mechanics, particularly for mixed formulations in elastoplasticity problems.

Method: Introduce a semismooth Newton solver specifically designed for this class of nonlinear equations, using biorthogonal basis functions for hp-finite element discretization.

Result: The solver is proven to be well-defined and locally convergent, with numerical examples showing applicability and robustness with respect to mesh size h and polynomial order p.

Conclusion: The proposed semismooth Newton solver is effective and robust for solving nonlinear systems in hp-finite element discretizations of elastoplasticity problems.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of systems of nonlinear equations, which arise in discretized mixed formulations of problems in solid mechanics by $hp$-finite elements. We introduce a semismooth Newton solver for this specific class and prove its well-definedness and local convergence. Thereby, the analysis heavily relies on a special eigenvalue interplay of two matrices involved in the considered nonlinear system. Next, we apply the general results to an $hp$-finite element discretization of a problem in elastoplasticity, which can be formulated as a system of nonlinear equations of the above type by using biorthogonal basis functions. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the applicability and robustness of the proposed semismooth Newton solver with respect to $h$ and $p$.

### [7] [ATMPlace: Analytical Thermo-Mechanical-Aware Placement Framework for 2.5D-IC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17319)
*Qipan Wang,Tianxiang Zhu,Tianyu Jia,Yibo Lin,Runsheng Wang,Ru Huang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: ATMPlace is an analytical placer for 2.5D ICs that jointly optimizes wirelength, temperature, and warpage using physics-based models, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional placement tools for 2.5D ICs have poor scalability, rely on slow simulations, and focus only on wirelength minimization, failing to address critical thermal and mechanical reliability challenges in heterogeneous integration.

Method: ATMPlace uses analytical placement with physics-based compact models to jointly optimize wirelength, peak temperature, and operational warpage for 2.5D IC systems with multiple chiplets.

Result: ATMPlace achieves 146% and 52% geometric mean wirelength improvement over TAP 2.5D and TACPlace respectively, with 3-13% lower temperature, 5-27% less warpage, and runs approximately 10 times faster.

Conclusion: The framework is general and can be extended for fast, scalable, and reliable design exploration of next-generation 2.5D systems, addressing multiple physical constraints simultaneously.

Abstract: Rising demand in AI and automotive applications is accelerating 2.5D IC adoption, with multiple chiplets tightly placed to enable high-speed interconnects and heterogeneous integration. As chiplet counts grow, traditional placement tools, limited by poor scalability and reliance on slow simulations, must evolve beyond wirelength minimization to address thermal and mechanical reliability, critical challenges in heterogeneous integration. In this paper, we present ATMPlace, the first analytical placer for 2.5D ICs that jointly optimizes wirelength, peak temperature, and operational warpage using physics-based compact models. It generates Pareto optimal placements for systems with dozens of chiplets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance: 146 percent and 52 percent geometric mean wirelength improvement over TAP 2.5D and TACPlace, respectively, with 3 to 13 percent lower temperature and 5 to 27 percent less warpage, all achieved approximately 10 times faster. The proposed framework is general and can be extended to enable fast, scalable, and reliable design exploration for next-generation 2.5D systems.

### [8] [A Conservative Cascade Semi-Lagrangian Method for Solving the Vlasov Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17347)
*Chunyang Xu,Michel Mehrenberger,Chang Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper applies the conservative cascade semi-Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to plasma kinetics, achieving second-order accuracy with improvements for volume conservation and oscillation suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the potential advantages of the cascade remapping method in conservation and scalability for plasma kinetics, where its application has been limited.

Method: Applied CCSL scheme to Vlasov equation with two improvements: freestream preserving correction for exact volume conservation and maximum principle limiter for oscillation suppression.

Result: Numerical tests confirm high accuracy, robustness, and long-term stability. CCSL better preserves physical invariants than CSL and BSL schemes under divergence-free conditions.

Conclusion: CCSL provides a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability.

Abstract: The cascade remapping method, originally proposed by Nair et al. (2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability.

### [9] [The F. John model and Cummins' equations for freely floating objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16826)
*David Lannes,Martin Oen Paulsen*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper establishes the well-posedness theory for F. John's problem describing interactions between free-surface fluids and floating objects, providing rigorous justification for Cummins equations used in naval engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for F. John's problem, which models fluid-solid interactions in naval engineering through Cummins equations, addressing the lack of existing well-posedness proofs.

Method: The authors show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure with a non-definite Hamiltonian, requiring work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. They analyze the boundary value problem for velocity potential and address elliptic regularity issues caused by corners in the fluid domain.

Result: The paper proves the well-posedness of F. John's problem and Cummins equations, showing solutions generally have limited regularity (no better than C³) due to corner-induced elliptic regularity issues. Higher regularity is demonstrated for small contact angles (≤π/2) when compatibility conditions are satisfied.

Conclusion: F. John's problem is well-posed with limited regularity in general, but higher regularity can be achieved under specific geometric conditions. The analysis reveals qualitative differences between different degrees of freedom - vertical motion can be C^∞ while horizontal translation is limited to C³.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $π/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally.

### [10] [Fully localised three-dimensional solitary water waves on Beltrami flows with strong surface tension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16843)
*Mark D. Groves,Erik Wahlén*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence theory for fully localized 3D solitary water waves with parallel vorticity and velocity fields (Beltrami flows), strong surface tension, and free surface described by z=η(x,y).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the existence of fully localized three-dimensional solitary water waves that decay in all horizontal directions, under specific physical assumptions including Beltrami flow conditions and strong surface tension.

Method: Formulate governing equations as a single equation for η, reduce to perturbation of KP-I equation, use implicit-function theorem to show persistence of nondegenerate localized solutions under perturbations.

Result: Demonstrates existence of such fully localized 3D solitary waves through mathematical analysis showing that known solutions of KP-I equation persist in the perturbed system.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes an existence theory for fully localized three-dimensional solitary water waves under the specified physical conditions using perturbation methods and the implicit-function theorem.

Abstract: Fully localised three-dimensional solitary waves are steady water waves which are evanescent in every horizontal direction. This paper presents an existence theory for such waves under the assumptions that the relative vorticity and velocity fields are parallel (`Beltrami flows'), that the free surface of the water takes the form $\{z=η(x,y)\}$ for some function $η: {\mathbb R}^2\rightarrow{\mathbb R}$, and that the influence of surface tension is sufficiently strong. The governing equations are formulated as a single equation for $η$, which is then reduced to a perturbation of the KP-I equation. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate localised solutions, and an application of a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem shows that they persist under perturbations.

### [11] [On the asymptotic dynamics for the $L^2$-supercritical gKDV equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16847)
*Ricardo Freire,Claudio Muñoz*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified description of the non-solitonic region for the L²-supercritical gKdV equation with p>5, showing that asymptotic dynamics is determined by the growth rate of the gradient's L² norm, with sharp far-field decay and local vanishing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-time dynamics of supercritical gKdV equations beyond small data solutions and soliton constructions, particularly for arbitrary H¹ solutions (both global and blowing up) in the non-solitonic region.

Method: A new virial method that compensates for possible unboundedness of H¹ norm by exploiting mass conservation and careful localization of nonlinear flux, without requiring smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.

Result: Proved sharp far-field decay on both half-lines, established normalized local vanishing along time sequences, with improved estimates for even-power nonlinearities. Showed asymptotic L² and L^p dynamics is determined by growth rate of gradient's L² norm.

Conclusion: The analysis provides quantitative versions of decay phenomena in supercritical settings, unifying the description of non-solitonic dynamics for arbitrary H¹ solutions and establishing fundamental connections between norm growth and asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We study the $L^2$-supercritical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (gKdV) with nonlinearities $p>5$. While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.

*Leyun Wu,Chilin Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper proves that for Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates modeled by a nonlocal system, any positive entire solution satisfying specific monotonicity conditions must be one-dimensional in certain parameter ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend classical De Giorgi-type classification theorems to nonlocal coupled systems arising in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, particularly focusing on Rabi-coupled condensates with inter- and intra-species interactions.

Method: The authors study a nonlocal system of fractional Laplacian equations modeling stationary states of Rabi-coupled condensates. They analyze positive entire solutions satisfying monotonicity conditions and prove one-dimensionality results using De Giorgi-type techniques.

Result: For 1/2 ≤ s < 1 in ℝ³, any positive entire solution with ∂ₓ₃u > 0 > ∂ₓ₃v must be one-dimensional. For 0 < s < 1/2 in ℝ², the same conclusion holds for monotone solutions.

Conclusion: This work successfully generalizes De Giorgi-type theorems to nonlocal coupled systems and provides the first Liouville-type classification of monotone solutions for Rabi-coupled fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, particularly in fractional Gross-Pitaevskii models.

Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type.
  In the present (second) paper of the series, we focus on the nonlocal problem of the form
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  (-Δ)^{s}u+u(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+v(αuv-ω)=0,
  (-Δ)^{s}v+v(u^{2}+v^{2}-1)+u(αuv-ω)=0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*}
  which models the stationary states of Rabi-coupled condensates with inter- and intra-species interactions.
  We prove that for $\frac{1}{2}\le s<1$, any positive entire solution $(u,v)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying the monotonicity condition $\partial_{x_3}u>0>\partial_{x_3}v$ must be one-dimensional. Moreover, when $0<s<\frac{1}{2}$, the same conclusion holds for monotone solutions in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
  Our work generalizes classical De Giorgi-type theorems to a new class of nonlocal coupled systems and, to the best of our knowledge, presents the first Liouville-type classification of monotone solutions for Rabi-coupled fractional Bose-Einstein condensates, with particular emphasis on fractional Gross-Pitaevskii models.

TL;DR: Global existence and convergence of smooth solutions for fourth-order biharmonic flow of planar curves with external forcing, using support function reformulation and Monge-Ampére structure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study evolution of closed planar curves under biharmonic flow with forcing, arising from biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy.

Method: Reformulate geometric flow using support function for scalar PDE characterization, analyze Monge-Ampére structure under geometric constraints, prove convexity preservation.

Result: Established global existence of smooth solutions, demonstrated convexity preservation, derived sufficient conditions for long-time convergence to steady states.

Conclusion: Forcing terms stabilize high-order curvature flows and enhance qualitative behavior, extending geometric analysis developments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of smooth, closed planar curves under a fourth order biharmonic flow with an external forcing term. Such flows arise naturally in the theory of biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy. We first establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the associated initial value problem, assuming appropriate conditions on the forcing term. The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Ampére type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior. Furthermore, we prove that convexity is preserved during the evolution and derive sufficient conditions ensuring long time convergence to steady-state solutions. Our results extend recent developments in geometric analysis by clarifying the role of forcing terms in stabilizing high order curvature flows and enhancing their qualitative behavior.

*Masakazu Yamamoto*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Analysis of the Debye-Hueckel drift-diffusion equation showing how electric fields distort radial symmetry and cause scale shifts in charge density beyond logarithmic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how electric fields affect charge density symmetry and scaling in plasma behavior and MOSFET simulation models, going beyond previous logarithmic shift analyses.

Method: Studying the initial value problem for the Debye-Hueckel drift-diffusion equation with localized initial density, analyzing the electric field effects on charge density symmetry and scaling.

Result: Derived concrete functions describing electric field effects, showing distortion of radial symmetry and scale shifts in charge density that exceed logarithmic corrections.

Conclusion: The electric field causes significant symmetry distortion and scale shifts in charge density, revealing stronger nonlinear effects than previously captured by logarithmic shift analyses.

Abstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.

*Huyuan Chen,Florica C. Cîrstea,Aleksandar Miladinovic*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies positive solutions to elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and providing exact asymptotic behavior near zero and infinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the existence and asymptotic behavior of positive solutions for elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms, particularly revealing new phenomena compared to previous work.

Method: Defining parameters β and function f_{ρ,λ,τ}, using modified Kelvin transform to reduce the study, and analyzing radial symmetry and asymptotic behavior.

Result: Positive solutions exist if and only if f_{ρ,λ,τ}(β) > 0, all solutions are radially symmetric, and exact asymptotic behavior near zero and infinity is provided.

Conclusion: The paper establishes complete characterization of positive solutions, revealing new phenomena in the case θ < -2 through modified Kelvin transform analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the set of all positive distributional $C^1(\mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\})$-solutions of elliptic equations with mixed reaction terms of the form $$ \mathbb L_{ρ,λ,τ}[u]:= Δu-(N-2+2ρ) \frac{x\cdot \nabla u}{|x|^2} +λ\frac{u^τ|\nabla u|^{1-τ}}{|x|^{1+τ}}=|x|^θu^q\quad \mbox{in } \mathbb R^N\setminus \{0\}, $$ where $ρ,λ, θ\in \mathbb R$ are arbitrary, $N\geq 2$, $q>1$ and $τ\in [0,1)$. Defining $β=(θ+2)/(q-1)$ and $f_{ρ,λ,τ}(t)=t\left(t+2ρ\right) +λ|t|^{1-τ}$ for $t\in \mathbb R$, we show that the equation has positive solutions if and only if $f_{ρ,λ,τ}(β)>0$. Under this condition, we provide existence and the exact asymptotic behaviour near zero and at infinity for all positive solutions. We obtain that all such solutions are radially symmetric. When $θ<-2$ and $ρ,λ\in \mathbb R$, we also find the precise local behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of our equation in $Ω\setminus \{0\}$, where $Ω$ is an open set containing $0$. By introducing the second term in $\mathbb L_{ρ,λ,τ}[\cdot]$ with $ρ\in \mathbb R$, we reduce the study to $θ<-2$ via a modified Kelvin transform. We reveal new and surprising phenomena compared with the work of Cîrstea and Fărcăşeanu (2021), where $ρ=(2-N)/2$ and $τ=1$.

Result: Developed a comprehensive theory for infinite-dimensional DAEs with inputs/outputs that can handle algebraic constraints through extended operator nodes and extrapolation spaces.

Conclusion: The extended theory successfully characterizes infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian DAEs and provides a framework for analyzing systems with algebraic constraints in infinite dimensions.

Abstract: Infinite-dimensional differential algebraic equations (short DAEs) with input and output are studied. The concepts of operator nodes and system nodes are extended to systems which additionally may include algebraic constraints. Extrapolation spaces are investigated for differential-algebraic equations, and solutions of the extrapolated DAE are characterized using augmented Wong sequences. The resulting theory is then applied to characterize infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian DAEs.

### [17] [Stability and bifurcation of 2D viscous primitive equations with full diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17055)
*Song Jiang,Quan Wang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the stability and bifurcation of 2D viscous primitive equations with thermal forcing, identifying a critical temperature difference Tc that governs system transitions across subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous mathematical foundations for understanding convection cell formation in large-scale geophysical flows by closing gaps in stability analysis of thermally driven primitive equations.

Method: Rigorous analysis using energy methods, spectral theory, dynamical systems theory, and bootstrap arguments across three thermal regimes; reduction to center manifold near critical point.

Result: Subcritical regime: global nonlinear stability with exponential decay; Critical regime: nonlinear stability and asymptotic convergence to zero; Supercritical regime: nonlinear instability across all Lp-norms; Supercritical bifurcation generates countable family of stable steady states forming local ring attractor.

Conclusion: The work provides complete characterization of stability transitions in thermally driven primitive equations, establishing critical temperature difference as fundamental parameter governing system dynamics and convection cell formation.

Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and bifurcation of the two-dimensional viscous primitive equations with full diffusion under thermal forcing. The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish local wellposedness for Gross-Pitaevskii equations with rough potentials that include spatial white noise, which requires renormalization procedures.

Method: Construct Schrödinger operator from quadratic form, analyze domain regularity, use paracontrolled approach for Strichartz estimates, apply contraction argument.

Result: Proven local wellposedness in dimension 2 for general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes local wellposedness using paracontrolled methods and Strichartz estimates for rough potential cases including white noise.

Abstract: In this paper, the local wellposedness of a general Gross-Pitaevskii equation with rough potential is proven in dimension 2. The class of rough potentials we are considering is large enough to contain the spatial white noise and thus a renormalization procedure may be needed. We first construct the associated Schrödinger operator from its quadratic form. Then, the regularity of elements of its domain is explored. This allows to use a paracontrolled approach in order to obtain Strichartz estimates, which are used to prove the local wellposedness by a contraction argument.

*Marius Ghergu,Zhe Yu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies singular solutions to elliptic inequalities and equations with singular potentials. It extends Brezis-Lions results to radially symmetric potentials and provides sharp conditions for existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions to Choquard-type equations with singular kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical results by Brezis and Lions (1982) on elliptic inequalities from constant potentials to radially symmetric potentials, and to investigate singular solutions of Choquard-type equations with singular convolution kernels, establishing optimal conditions for existence and asymptotic behavior.

Method: Analytical methods in partial differential equations, including careful analysis of singular behavior near the origin, classification of solutions based on local behavior of potentials, and establishing sharp conditions on exponents through rigorous mathematical proofs.

Result: For elliptic inequalities with radially symmetric potentials, optimal conditions are provided ensuring local integrability of solutions and their Laplacians. For Choquard-type equations, sharp conditions on exponents α, β, p, q are established for existence of singular solutions with specific asymptotic behavior |x|^{2-N} near the origin, with complete classification for N=2 based on potential behavior.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends classical results to more general potentials and provides a comprehensive analysis of singular solutions to Choquard-type equations, establishing optimal conditions for existence and precise asymptotic behavior near singular points.

Abstract: The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, we investigate the inequality $$ -Δu+V(x) u\geq f\quad\mbox{ in } B_1\setminus\{0\}\subset \mathbb{R}^N , N \geq 2, $$ where $f\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. If $V\geq 0$ is radially symmetric, we provide optimal conditions for which any solution $0\leq u\in \mathcal{C}^2(B_1\setminus\{0\})$ of the above inequality satisfies $u, Δu, V(x)u\in L^1_{loc}(B_1)$. This extends a result of H. Brezis and P.-L. Lions (1982), originally established for constant potentials $V$. Second, we investigate the equation $$\displaystyle -Δu + λV(x) u = (K_{α, β} * u^p) u^q \quad\text{in } B_1 \setminus \{0\},$$ where $0\leq V\in \mathcal{C}^{0, ν}( \overline B_1\setminus\{0\})$, $0<ν<1$, $λ, p, q>0$ and $$K_{α, β}(x) = |x|^{-α}\log^β\frac{2e}{|x|}, \quad\text{where } 0 \leq α< N, β\in \mathbb{R}.$$ For $N \geq 3$, we establish sharp conditions on the exponents $α, β, p, q$ under which singular solutions exist and exhibit the asymptotic behavior $u(x) \simeq |x|^{2-N}$ near the origin. For $N = 2$, we provide a classification of the existence and boundedness of solutions based on the local behavior of the potential $V(x)$ near the origin.

Motivation: To provide rigorous mathematical foundation for the incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell Two-Fluid system and establish connection with XMHD framework used in plasma physics.

Method: Adaptation of the filtering unitary group method (developed by S. Schochet) to derive modulation equations capturing long-time behavior near constant neutral background with non-zero densities.

Result: Proved existence and well-posedness of modulation equations; established one-to-one correspondence between solutions of asymptotic equations and incompressible XMHD; captured plasma phenomena up to ion and electron skin depths.

Conclusion: Provides new mathematical basis for XMHD framework, enabling simplified access to plasma phenomena including two-fluid turbulence, Hall/inertial effects, and collisionless magnetic reconnection.

Abstract: In this text, the filtering unitary group method developed, among others, by S. Schochet is adapted to prove the existence and well-posedness of modulation equations describing the incompressible limit of the Euler-Maxwell Two-Fluid (EMTF) system. The reduced model captures up to the ion and electron skin depths the long-time behavior of solutions near a constant neutral background with non-zero densities. In the prepared case, the solutions of our asymptotic equations are in one-to-one correspondence with those of incompressible eXtended MagnetoHyDrodynamics (XMHD), hence providing a new basis to the XMHD framework which is currently being studied by physicists through Hamiltonian methods, see P.J. Morrison et al. By this way, we can give a simplified access to many plasma phenomena such as (a form of two-fluid) turbulence, Hall and inertial effects, as well as collisionless magnetic reconnection.

*Yahong Guo,Congming Li,Yugao Ouyang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes local boundary Hölder regularity for fractional Dirichlet problems in unbounded domains, replacing global L∞ norms with local ones, enabling blow-up and rescaling analysis for a priori estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing boundary regularity results require global L∞ norm control, which is insufficient for blow-up and rescaling analysis in unbounded domains, limiting a priori estimates.

Method: Derive local boundary Hölder regularity for nonnegative solutions using only local L∞ norms instead of global ones, then apply this to establish a priori estimates for nonlinear equations.

Result: Successfully obtained local boundary Hölder regularity and used it to establish a priori estimates for nonlinear equations on unbounded domains with boundaries.

Conclusion: The local boundary regularity approach overcomes limitations of global norm requirements, enabling effective blow-up and rescaling analysis for a priori estimates in unbounded domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundary Hölder regularity for solutions to the fractional Dirichlet problem in unbounded domains with boundary \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  (-Δ)^s u(x) = g(x),&\text{in } Ω,
  u(x)=0, &\text{in } Ω^c.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*} Existing results rely on the global $L^{\infty}$ norm of solutions to control their boundary $C^s$ norm, which is insufficient for blow-up and rescaling analysis to obtain a priori estimates in unbounded domains. To overcome this limitation, we first derive a local version of boundary Hölder regularity for nonnegative solutions in which we replace the global $L^{\infty}$ norm by only a local $L^{\infty}$ norm. Then as an important application, we establish a priori estimates for nonnegative solutions to a family of nonlinear equations on unbounded domains with boundaries.

Result: Successful construction of Feynman operator and proof of uniform microlocal estimates in asymptotically de Sitter spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the wave operator $\square_g$ on non-trapping (at all energies) even asymptotically de Sitter spaces. We construct a Feynman operator on the conformal extension of asymptotically de Sitter spaces and give a proof of uniform microlocal estimates for the Feynman operator in this setting. This enables the study of the Lorentzian "spectral" zeta functions in asymptotically de Sitter and the construction of a "spectral" action of the Feynman propagator.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability for nonlinear plate equations with hinged boundary conditions and analytic nonlinearity, using localized damping/control in observable regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish stabilization and control results for nonlinear plate equations by relaxing geometric conditions for unique continuation properties.

Method: Combining propagation of analyticity in time with unique continuation for linear plate operators, exploiting linear observability to prove exponential decay and semiglobal exact control.

Result: Proved exponential decay of nonlinear energy under defocusing assumption, and semiglobal exact controllability under weaker asymptotic assumption using damped equation dynamics.

Conclusion: New unique continuation property enables semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability for nonlinear plate equations with significantly relaxed geometric conditions.

Abstract: In this article we prove semiglobal stabilization and exact controllability results for nonlinear plate equations with hinged boundary conditions and analytic nonlinearity. These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schrödinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the behavior of solutions to the focusing modified KdV equation in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces, particularly examining norm inflation phenomena.

Method: Construct a sequence of solutions u_n whose initial data u_n(0) converges to zero in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces F L^p_s(R) for p≠2 and all s∈R, but whose evolutions at later times t_n diverge to infinity.

Result: Demonstrated norm inflation: initial data converges to zero in F L^p_s(R) spaces, but solutions at later times diverge to infinity in these norms.

Conclusion: The focusing modified KdV equation exhibits norm inflation in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces for p≠2, showing that small initial data can lead to arbitrarily large solutions at later times.

Abstract: We demonstrate inflation of Fourier--Lebesgue norms for solutions to the focusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation posed on the real line. For $p\neq 2$ and all $s\in \mathbb{R}$, we construct a sequence of solutions $u_n$ whose initial data $u_n(0)$ converges to zero in the Fourier--Lebesgue spaces $\mathcal F L^p_s(\mathbb{R})$, but whose evolutions at later times $t_n$ diverge to infinity.

*Andrea Medaglia*

TL;DR: A Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for the multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation that handles realistic mass ratios up to proton-electron levels without iterative solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mesh-free, scalable Monte Carlo method for multispecies plasma simulations that can handle realistic mass ratios and avoid complex iterative solvers.

Method: Derived from first-order approximation of multispecies Boltzmann operator in grazing collision limit, using regularized scattering kernel that preserves Landau dynamics invariants.

Result: Accurate simulations up to physical proton-electron mass ratio (1836), validated against multispecies BKW benchmark, showing conservation of mass/momentum/energy and Maxwellian equilibria convergence.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient, mesh-free approach for multispecies plasma simulations with realistic mass ratios, suitable for coupling with particle-in-cell solvers.

Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.

*Matt Landreman,Humberto Torreblanca,Antoine Cerfon*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: A fast method for calculating magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials in fusion reactors using point dipoles, verified against finite-element methods and applied to plasma equilibrium calculations and coil optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ferromagnetic steels in fusion reactor blankets affect plasma physics, requiring efficient field calculations to assess impact on confinement and stability.

Method: Use saturated magnetization approximation to model magnetic materials as point dipoles oriented with coil/plasma fields, avoiding nonlinear solves and using Biot-Savart integrals.

Result: Method is accurate, fast, compatible with CAD geometry, and shows steel has minimal plasma impact (slight ballooning mode destabilization and edge island shifts) corrected by minor coil reoptimization.

Conclusion: Point dipole method efficiently handles ferromagnetic effects in fusion design, enabling gradient-based coil optimization with minimal plasma disruption.

Abstract: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.

TL;DR: Study of nanoparticle growth in nonthermal plasmas, focusing on titanium dioxide and carbonaceous dust, with investigation of magnetic field effects on growth cycles and spatial distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand nanoparticle growth dynamics in plasmas, particularly how magnetic fields influence growth cycles and particle behavior, expanding beyond traditional carbonaceous/silicate dust to include new materials like titanium dioxide.

Method: Grew titanium dioxide dust from titanium tetraisopropoxide precursor and carbonaceous dust from acetylene in argon plasma, comparing growth with and without magnetic fields (20-1000 Gauss range), analyzing particle size, growth time, and spatial distribution.

Result: Both dust types exhibited growth cycles where particles move away after reaching critical size, allowing new generations. Magnetic fields decreased cycle time and altered spatial distribution, with carbonaceous dust showing minimum cycle time at 330 Gauss coinciding with electron magnetization.

Conclusion: Magnetic fields significantly impact nanoparticle growth dynamics in plasmas, reducing cycle times and modifying spatial distributions, with electron magnetization playing a key role in observed minimum growth cycle time.

Abstract: Solid nanoparticles which range in size from 1 to 500 nm can spontaneously grow from reactive gaseous precursors in nonthermal plasmas. This dissertation studies the particle size, and growth time with and without a background magnetic field in the plasma. Traditionally, studies have focused on the growth of either carbonaceous or silicate dust from either acetylene or silane, respectively. However, recently, there have been a shift towards studying new kinds of dust. For example, recent studies have grown polymers and metallic dust. This dissertation first introduces and studies the growth of titanium dioxide dust from the metal-organic vapor precursor of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The as-grown materials are amorphous but high temperature annealing crystallizes the samples into anatase and subsequently rutile. Then, the growth of titania dusty plasma is and compared to the growth of carbonaceous dust from acetylene, in argon plasma. They are grown during the presence and absence of weak magnetic fields of 500 Gauss. Both kinds of dust growth exhibit a growth cycle, which had already been shown for various nano dusty plasma. This occurs because once the dust accumulates a critical radius and mass, they move away from the central region of the plasma, allowing a new generation of growth begins. Ultimately, the new generation of growth also moves away leading to a continuous cycle of particle formation and transport as long as the plasma is on. However, with the presence of the magnetic field, the cycle time decreases, and the spatial distribution of the dust cloud appears differently. Finally, we focus on the growth cycle time of carbonaceous dust and how it decreases with a gradual increase in magnetic field, varying from 20 - 1000 Gauss. We particularly noticed a minimum at 330 Gauss, which coincides with electron magnetization.

TL;DR: A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is developed to identify the most credible constitutive models for soft materials using laser-induced microcavitation data, addressing measurement noise and parameter uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing soft materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions is challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Current microcavitation techniques face limitations from measurement noise and parameter estimation uncertainty.

Method: Employed hierarchical Bayesian model selection with Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR), using weighted Gaussian likelihood with hierarchical noise scale and physically informed priors to penalize complex models. Used precomputed simulation grids for probabilistic model selection.

Result: Synthetic tests successfully recovered ground-truth models and parameters. Experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose showed MAP simulations reproducing the data. Cross-institutional comparison of 10% gelatin demonstrated consistent constitutive model selection.

Conclusion: The hierarchical Bayesian approach effectively addresses limitations of microcavitation techniques, enabling reliable identification of constitutive models for soft materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions with quantified uncertainty.

Abstract: The high-fidelity characterization of soft, tissue-like materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions is critical in engineering and medicine. Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility. Physically informed priors, including range-invariant, stress-based parameter priors, a model-redundancy prior, and a Bayesian Information Criterion motivated model prior, penalize complex models to enforce Occam's razor. Using a precomputed grid of simulations, the probabilistic model selection process enables an initial guess for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) material parameter values. Synthetic tests recover the ground-truth models and expected parameters. Using experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose, MAP simulations of credible models reproduce the data. Moreover, a cross-institutional comparison of 10% gelatin indicates consistent constitutive model selection.

*Stéphanie M. C. Abo,Ruth E. Baker*

Main category: q-bio.CB

TL;DR: The paper develops a mathematical framework to model cell invasion that incorporates age-dependent division rates, showing that age structure reduces carrying capacity, slows invasion speeds, and links population survival to positive invasion speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical models treat cell division as memoryless with exponential cell-cycle times, but experimental data shows peaked distributions indicating maturation delays. This gap motivates incorporating age-dependent division rates while maintaining analytical tractability.

Method: A moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division with age resetting to zero at division, yielding explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Age structure reduces carrying capacity and narrows viable parameter range; 2) Classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds - true minimal speed is slower with age-dependent division; 3) Parameter condition for population survival equals condition for positive invasion speed.

Conclusion: The framework bridges classical models and experimental observations, revealing fundamental principles about how age-dependent division affects population dynamics and invasion behavior.

Abstract: Cell populations invade through a combination of proliferation and motility. Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.
  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states. Second, classical linear theory overestimates invasion speeds; the true minimal speed is slower when division is age-dependent. Third, the parameter condition for population survival is identical to the condition for a positive invasion speed.

Result: Identified optimal quantum circuits for Ingleton violation, determined maximal attainable violation, revealed characteristic quantum resource patterns, and showed Ingleton-violating states are extremely rare and occupy isolated Hilbert space regions.

Conclusion: Established a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.

### [33] [Computer Simulation of Gel Formation in Colloidal Systems of Sticky Rods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16872)
*Johannes Krotz*

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: A simulation framework for colloidal gelation is developed and validated, extending from spherical particles to spherocylindrical rods with Kihara interactions, using topological data analysis for microstructure characterization and comparison with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop functional methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids and provide topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between experiments and simulations.

Method: Reproduce benchmark results for spherical particles, extend to spherocylindrical rods with Kihara-like potential, conduct parameter sweeps, analyze network formation, and use Early TDA for topological characterization.

Result: Clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, rheological signatures characteristic of gels, qualitative agreement with experimental trends but quantitative limitations for specific systems.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates extensible simulation methods, provides useful topological metrics for experiment-simulation comparison, and outlines promising directions for future refinement.

Abstract: We develop and validate a simulation framework for colloidal gelation. We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application.

*Thomas Philippe,Yijian Wu,Aymane Graini*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Seeded molecular dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation show that classical nucleation theory accurately predicts stable cluster radii, with good equations of state providing excellent agreement while simpler approximations work well at low temperatures but deviate at high temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of brute-force molecular dynamics simulations in studying nucleation at low supersaturation conditions and to test classical nucleation theory predictions in confined systems.

Method: Performed NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems, comparing results with classical nucleation theory predictions using various thermodynamic models including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation.

Result: CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across wide conditions. Seeded simulation results correspond to critical cluster radii of infinite systems. Good equations of state show excellent agreement with simulations, while perturbation theory and ideal gas approximation work well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.

Conclusion: Seeded simulations provide an effective method for studying nucleation at lower supersaturation, and classical nucleation theory with appropriate thermodynamic models can accurately predict critical cluster properties, though simpler approximations have temperature-dependent limitations.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.

### [35] [Analysis of a class of recursive distributional equations including the resistance of the series-parallel graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11036)
*Peter S. Morfe*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Analysis of recursive distributional equations (RDEs) with bias parameter p, including series-parallel graph resistance. Derives evolution equation resembling nonlinear Fisher-KPP equation, shows PDE scaling limit at p=1/2, and proves distributional limit theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze a class of RDEs proposed by Gurel-Gurevich involving bias parameter p, which includes the logarithm of resistance in series-parallel graphs, and to prove conjectured distributional limits.

Method: Derived discrete-time evolution equation resembling nonlinear fractional Fisher-KPP equation for CDFs of solutions. Showed PDE scaling limit when p=1/2 and derived distributional limit theorems from this scaling.

Result: When bias parameter p=1/2, the evolution equation has a PDE scaling limit, leading to distributional limit theorems for the RDE. Applied to series-parallel graphs, proved that N^{-1/3} log R^{(N)} has nondegenerate limit, confirming Addario-Berry et al.'s conjecture.

Conclusion: The analysis establishes rigorous distributional limit theorems for RDEs with bias parameter p=1/2, confirming conjectures about the scaling behavior of series-parallel graph resistance and providing mathematical foundation for these recursive distributional equations.

Abstract: This paper analyzes a class of recursive distributional equations (RDE's) proposed by Gurel-Gurevich [17] and involving a bias parameter $p$, which includes the logarithm of the resistance of the series-parallel graph. A discrete-time evolution equation resembling a nonlinear, fractional Fisher-KPP equation is derived to describe the CDF's of solutions. When the bias parameter $p = \frac{1}{2}$, this equation is shown to have a PDE scaling limit, from which distributional limit theorems for the RDE are derived. Applied to the series-parallel graph, the results imply that $N^{-1/3} \log R^{(N)}$ has a nondegenerate limit when $p = \frac{1}{2}$, as conjectured by Addario-Berry, Cairns, Devroye, Kerriou, and Mitchell [1].

*Danko Aldunate,Julien Ricaud,Edgardo Stockmeyer*

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: The paper analyzes spectral properties of the Dirac operator in the Soler model, showing that for p≥1 only ground state eigenvalues exist, while for p<1 additional eigenvalues emerge from essential spectrum thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the gap property and spectral structure of the Dirac operator in the Soler model with power nonlinearity, particularly how eigenvalues behave relative to essential spectrum thresholds.

Method: Spectral analysis of the Dirac operator L_0 arising from linearization around standing wave solutions in the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}.

Result: For p≥1, only eigenvalues are ground state energies (-2ω and 0); for p<1, additional eigenvalues appear from essential spectrum thresholds. Thresholds never admit eigenvalues and have at most one resonance.

Conclusion: The gap property holds for p≥1 but breaks down for p<1, with spectral behavior fundamentally changing at the critical exponent p=1.

Abstract: We study spectral properties of the Dirac operator $L_0$ arising as the upper-right off-diagonal block in the linearization around standing wave solutions of the one-dimensional Soler model with power nonlinearity $f(s)=s|s|^{p-1}$, $p>0$. Our main results concern the so-called gap property: we show that if $p \geq 1$, then the only eigenvalues of $L_0$ are its ground state energies, $-2ω$ and $0$. In contrast, for $p<1$, additional eigenvalues appear from the thresholds of the essential spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that the thresholds never admit eigenvalues and that they have at most one resonance.

### [38] [The impact of ionising collisions on channeling and radiation emission for high-energy electrons and positrons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17287)
*Andrei V. Korol,Andrey V. Solov'yov*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: Analysis of how inelastic collisions affect channeling efficiency and radiation intensity for high-energy electrons/positrons in crystals, showing electrons are minimally affected while positrons show significant efficiency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively understand the impact of inelastic atomic collisions on channeling phenomena and radiation emission in crystalline targets for high-energy particles.

Method: Numerical simulations using MBN Explorer software with classical relativistic molecular dynamics, comparing cases with and without ionizing collisions for 10 GeV electrons/positrons in diamond and silicon crystals.

Result: For electrons: negligible impact on channeling efficiency and radiation intensity. For positrons: significant reduction in channeling efficiency, with radiation intensity effects depending on collection cone opening angle.

Conclusion: Ionizing collisions can be neglected in electron simulations for computational efficiency, but must be included for accurate positron channeling analysis, with radiation effects being angle-dependent.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions with atoms in a crystalline environment on the channeling efficiency and intensity of the channeling radiation for high-energy electrons and positrons passing through oriented crystalline targets. This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper.
