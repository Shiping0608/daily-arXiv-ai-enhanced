For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability.

This dissertation first introduces and studies the growth of titanium dioxide dust from the metal-organic vapor precursor of titanium tetraisopropoxide. The as-grown materials are amorphous but high temperature annealing crystallizes the samples into anatase and subsequently rutile. Then, the growth of titania dusty plasma is and compared to the growth of carbonaceous dust from acetylene, in argon plasma. They are grown during the presence and absence of weak magnetic fields of 500 Gauss. Both kinds of dust growth exhibit a growth cycle, which had already been shown for various nano dusty plasma. This occurs because once the dust accumulates a critical radius and mass, they move away from the central region of the plasma, allowing a new generation of growth begins. Ultimately, the new generation of growth also moves away leading to a continuous cycle of particle formation and transport as long as the plasma is on. However, with the presence of the magnetic field, the cycle time decreases, and the spatial distribution of the dust cloud appears differently.

It generates Pareto optimal placements for systems with dozens of chiplets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance: 146 percent and 52 percent geometric mean wirelength improvement over TAP 2.5D and TACPlace, respectively, with 3 to 13 percent lower temperature and 5 to 27 percent less warpage, all achieved approximately 10 times faster.

Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility.

Proliferation depends on the internal timing of cell division: how long cells take to complete the cell cycle. This timing varies substantially within (and across) cell types, creating age structure where cells at different times since their last division have different propensities to divide. Classical mathematical models of cell spreading treat division as memoryless and predict exponential cell-cycle-time distributions. Lineage tracing, by contrast, reveals peaked, gamma-like distributions that indicate a maturation delay leading to a fertility window. This gap motivates a modelling framework that incorporates age-dependent cell division rates while retaining analytical tractability.\n  We address this through a moment-hierarchy framework that tracks time since cell division, with age resetting to zero at division. The framework yields explicit formulae for steady-state age distributions, cell-cycle-time distributions, and invasion speeds. For age-independent rates, we recover classical Fisher--KPP. Three fundamental principles emerge. First, age structure systematically reduces a population's carrying capacity and narrows the viable parameter range for positive steady states.
