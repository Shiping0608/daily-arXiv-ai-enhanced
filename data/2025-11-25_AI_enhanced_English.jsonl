The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties.

Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive.

While experimental and simulation studies have demonstrated the benefits of PDA functionalization, the fundamental mechanism by which nanotube curvature modulates interfacial energy flow and mechanical polarity remains unresolved. This gap is sharpened by a persistent paradox: identical PDA functionalization strengthens some CNT-polymer systems while weakening others, a curvature-dependent inconsistency that has remained unexplained.

The approximation scheme is based on a variant of the Chernoff product formula on the space of bounded continuous functions. In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the L\u00e9vy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a L\u00e9vy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper develops an approximation scheme for L\u00e9vy processes with drift using a Chernoff product formula approach, providing convergence criteria for probability measure families and extending to processes with deterministic components.", "motivation": "To establish a general approximation framework for L\u00e9vy processes with drift that can handle various numerical schemes and provide explicit convergence criteria.", "method": "Uses Chernoff product formula on bounded continuous functions with mixed topology, analyzes convergence of probability measure families, and enriches measures with deterministic components.", "result": "Provides sufficient and necessary conditions for convergence of subsequences and entire families, with applications to Lipschitz ODE flows, Euler schemes, Runge-Kutta methods, and Central Limit Theorem.", "conclusion": "The framework successfully approximates L\u00e9vy processes with drift and encompasses various numerical methods under unified convergence criteria."}}
