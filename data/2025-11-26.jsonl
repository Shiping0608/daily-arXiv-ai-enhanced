Such minimizers represent the most stable states of type-II superconductors and, for large material parameters $κ$, capture the formation of lattices of quantized vortices. As the vortex cores shrink with increasing $κ$, while their number grows, it is essential to understand how $κ$ should couple to the mesh size in order to correctly resolve the vortex patterns in numerical simulations. We summarize and discuss recent developments based on LOD (Localized Orthogonal Decomposition) multiscale methods and review the corresponding error estimates that explicitly reflect the $κ$-dependence and the observed superconvergence. In addition, we include several minor refinements and extensions of existing results by incorporating techniques from recent contributions to the field. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings."}

We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise.

This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein.

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed."}

This makes exploring the capabilities of different attosecond imaging techniques crucial. Here, we propose attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a prominent technique for tracking ultrafast dynamics.

The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh.\n  Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method.

As acquiring field observations can be costly, a sequential training approach based on active learning is implemented to determine the most informative locations for new sensors. In particular, Monte Carlo dropout is used to quantify epistemic uncertainty and query measurements in regions where the model is least confident. This approach reduces the amount of required field data and optimizes sensor placement. The PINN is tested to reconstruct the displacement field around a deep tunnel of circular section excavated in transversely isotropic elastic rock and to determine rock constitutive and stress-field parameters. Results demonstrate excellent performance on small, scattered, and noisy datasets, achieving high precision for the Young's moduli, shear modulus, horizontal-to-vertical far-field stress ratio, and the orientation of the bedding planes.

Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target.

The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure.

To capture the ternary term in the quantum Landau operator, we introduce a new two-parameter scaling that preserves the quantum effects in the limit. Furthermore, we provide an explicit rate of convergence that depends on the regularity of the interaction potential."}

In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices."}

The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework."}

Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $θ$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed semi-analytical IGA method delivers accurate temperature predictions and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to standard FEM, establishing it as a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF."}

Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals."}

However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations."}

In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments."}

In each of these papers a proof was given that the solution by inverse scattering yields a classical solution to the PDE. The mNV equation lies in the integrable hierarchy of the DS II equation, so the same scattering transform may be used in both cases. In the 2014 paper, an incorrect formula is given for the nonlinearity in the mNV equation. Here we correct errors in the proof and obtain a correct statement of the mNV equation as solved by inverse scattering."}

In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework."}

This result is stressing the more stable behaviour of Yang-Mills Fields compare to harmonic maps as observed in other contexts such as the flow.
