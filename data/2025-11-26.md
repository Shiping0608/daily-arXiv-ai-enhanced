### [1] [The Ginzburg-Landau equations: Vortex states and numerical multiscale approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19540)
*Christian Döding,Patrick Henning*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Review of numerical methods for approximating Ginzburg-Landau energy minimizers in multiscale spaces, focusing on vortex lattice formation in type-II superconductors and κ-dependent mesh coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how material parameter κ should couple with mesh size to correctly resolve vortex patterns in numerical simulations of type-II superconductors, as vortex cores shrink while their number increases with κ.

Method: Uses Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) multiscale methods and incorporates recent techniques for numerical approximation of Ginzburg-Landau energy minimizers.

Result: Develops error estimates that explicitly reflect κ-dependence and demonstrate superconvergence, with numerical experiments supporting theoretical findings.

Conclusion: LOD multiscale methods provide effective numerical approximation of vortex patterns in type-II superconductors with proper κ-mesh coupling, showing superconvergence properties.

Abstract: In this review article, we provide an overview of recent advances in the numerical approximation of minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau energy in multiscale spaces. Such minimizers represent the most stable states of type-II superconductors and, for large material parameters $κ$, capture the formation of lattices of quantized vortices. As the vortex cores shrink with increasing $κ$, while their number grows, it is essential to understand how $κ$ should couple to the mesh size in order to correctly resolve the vortex patterns in numerical simulations. We summarize and discuss recent developments based on LOD (Localized Orthogonal Decomposition) multiscale methods and review the corresponding error estimates that explicitly reflect the $κ$-dependence and the observed superconvergence. In addition, we include several minor refinements and extensions of existing results by incorporating techniques from recent contributions to the field. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Structure-preserving finite volume schemes for barotropic Euler equations in low Mach regime with AP property and entropy stability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop numerical methods that preserve structure and remain stable in low Mach number regimes while maintaining asymptotic consistency

Method: Implicit-explicit (IMEX) method with acoustic/advection splitting and Mach-number-independent implicit numerical diffusion

Result: Proved positivity of density, entropy stability, and asymptotic consistency; validated with benchmark problems

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully achieves structure-preserving properties for barotropic Euler equations in low Mach regimes

Abstract: We develop structure-preserving finite volume schemes for the barotropic Euler equations in the low Mach number regime. Our primary focus lies in ensuring both the asymptotic-preserving (AP) property and the discrete entropy stability. We construct an implicit-explicit (IMEX) method with suitable acoustic/advection splitting including implicit numerical diffusion that is independent of the Mach number. We prove the positivity of density, the entropy stability, and the asymptotic consistency of the fully discrete numerical method rigorously. Numerical experiments for benchmark problems validate the structure-preserving properties of the proposed method.

### [3] [Designing Preconditioners for SGD: Local Conditioning, Noise Floors, and Basin Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19716)
*Mitchell Scott,Tianshi Xu,Ziyuan Tang,Alexandra Pichette-Emmons,Qiang Ye,Yousef Saad,Yuanzhe Xi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Analyzes preconditioned SGD in geometry induced by matrix M, showing convergence rate and noise floor depend on M-dependent quantities, with applications to Scientific Machine Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGD slows in late training due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise; preconditioning can improve conditioning while attenuating noise.

Method: Analyze preconditioned SGD in M-metric geometry, deriving bounds for convergence rate and noise floor using M-dependent effective condition number and preconditioned noise level.

Result: Established preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee for nonconvex objectives, with explicit lower bound on probability of staying in well-behaved region.

Conclusion: Framework provides design principle: choose M to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise; validated on quadratic diagnostic and SciML benchmarks.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) often slows in the late stage of training due to anisotropic curvature and gradient noise. We analyze preconditioned SGD in the geometry induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathbf{M}$, deriving bounds in which both the convergence rate and the stochastic noise floor are governed by $\mathbf{M}$-dependent quantities: the rate through an effective condition number in the $\mathbf{M}$-metric, and the floor through the product of that condition number and the preconditioned noise level. For nonconvex objectives, we establish a preconditioner-dependent basin-stability guarantee: when smoothness and basin size are measured in the $\mathbf{M}$-norm, the probability that the iterates remain in a well-behaved local region admits an explicit lower bound. This perspective is particularly relevant in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), where achieving small training loss under stochastic updates is closely tied to physical fidelity, numerical stability, and constraint satisfaction. The framework applies to both diagonal/adaptive and curvature-aware preconditioners and yields a simple design principle: choose $\mathbf{M}$ to improve local conditioning while attenuating noise. Experiments on a quadratic diagnostic and three SciML benchmarks validate the predicted rate-floor behavior.

### [5] [Multiscale Methods for wave propagation in materials with sign-changing coefficients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20103)
*Eric T. Chung,Patrick Ciarlet,Xingguang Jin,Changqing Ye*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper develops a specialized multiscale finite element method for metamaterials with sign-changing coefficients in electromagnetic wave problems, ensuring stability and accuracy through T-coercivity theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Metamaterials with negative dielectric permittivity or magnetic permeability transform coercive operators into non-coercive ones, potentially causing ill-posedness in numerical simulations.

Method: Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM) with tailored auxiliary spaces for sign-changing coefficients, based on T-coercivity theory and resolution conditions.

Result: Established inf-sup stability and provided a priori error estimate; numerical results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness for sophisticated coefficient profiles.

Conclusion: The proposed CEM-GMsFEM approach successfully handles metamaterials with sign-changing coefficients, maintaining stability and accuracy in electromagnetic wave simulations.

Abstract: From a mathematical perspective, the extraordinary properties of metamaterials are often reflected in the coefficients of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). These coefficients may fall outside the assumptions of classical theory, particularly when the effective dielectric permittivity and/or magnetic permeability are negative. This situation can transform a coercive operator into a non-coercive one, potentially leading to ill-posedness. In this paper, we utilize the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM), specifically designed for time-harmonic electromagnetic wave problems, where the construction of auxiliary spaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing setting. Based on the framework of \texttt{T}-coercivity theory and resolution conditions, we establish the inf-sup stability and provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in handling such sophisticated coefficient profiles.

### [6] [Parallel simulation and adaptive mesh refinement for 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems between deformable bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20142)
*Alexandre Epalle,Isabelle Ramière,Guillaume Latu,Frédéric Lebon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm for 3D elastostatic contact mechanics that combines node-to-node contact pairing with penalization and non-conforming h-adaptive refinement in a scalable framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable complex simulations exceeding current performance levels by developing scalable parallel AMR strategies for 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems.

Method: Combines node-to-node contact pairing with penalization technique and non-conforming h-adaptive refinement using estimate-mark-refine approach. Uses MPI-based parallel framework with contact nodes hosted by same tasks, super-parametric elements for domain curvature preservation, and equidistribution mesh partitioning.

Result: Efficient contact-AMR-HPC strategy demonstrated on 2D/3D Hertzian contact problems with various AMR criteria. Achieved parallel performance up to 1024 cores with analyzed memory footprint and preconditioner performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a scalable, robust, and efficient solution for parallel AMR in elastostatic contact mechanics, enabling accurate contact detection even with coarse initial meshes and low-order discretization.

Abstract: Parallel implementation of numerical adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)strategies for solving 3D elastostatic contact mechanics problems is an essential step toward complex simulations that exceed current performance levels. This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed.

### [7] [High order tracer variance stable transport with low order energy conserving dynamics for the thermal shallow water equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20181)
*David Lee,Kieran Ricardo,Tamara Tambyah*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A hybrid method coupling high-order discontinuous Galerkin transport with low-order mixed finite element dynamics for thermal shallow water equations, preserving energy conservation and tracer variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable numerical scheme that combines the accuracy of high-order transport with the robustness of low-order dynamics while maintaining conservation properties.

Method: Coupling high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for material transport with low-order mixed finite element solver via multigrid hierarchy, using collocation at Gauss-Legendre quadrature points.

Result: The scheme preserves energy conservation structure, provides provably tracer variance conservation/damping, and maintains stability while enabling richer turbulent solutions compared to purely low-order methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully balances accuracy and stability, demonstrating improved solution quality without compromising conservation properties, though limited by the low-order dynamics' formal accuracy.

Abstract: A high order discontinuous Galerkin method for the material transport of thermodynamic tracers is coupled to a low order mixed finite element solver in the context of the thermal shallow water equations. The coupling preserves the energy conserving structure of the low order dynamics solver, while the high order material transport scheme is provably tracer variance conserving, or damping with the inclusion of upwinding. The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh.
  Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method. While the overall scheme is limited by the formal order of accuracy of the low order dynamics, the use of high order, tracer variance conserving transport is shown to preserve richer turbulent solutions without compromising model stability compared to a purely low order method.

*Ben S. Ashby,Gabriel R. Barrenechea,Alex Lukyanov,Tristan Pryer,Alex Trenam*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A finite element framework for uniaxial Oldroyd-B model using de Rham-compatible discretization with exactly divergence-free velocity, combining interior-penalty viscosity and upwind transport, with energy-stable IMEX time-stepping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop reliable computational methods for viscoelastic flows at high Weissenberg numbers by leveraging structural analogies with MHD and ensuring discrete energy stability.

Method: De Rham-compatible finite elements with exactly divergence-free velocity, interior-penalty viscosity treatment, upwind transport for stress control, and energy-stable IMEX time-stepping scheme.

Result: Proved inf-sup conditions, well-posedness of discrete problem, and discrete energy law. Numerical tests show accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities.

Conclusion: De Rham-compatible discretizations with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity.

Abstract: We study the discretisation of a uniaxial (rank-one) reduction of the Oldroyd-B model for dilute polymer solutions, in which the conformation tensor is represented as $\sig = \vec b \otimes \vec b$. Building on structural analogies with MHD, we formulate a finite element framework compatible with the de Rham complex, so that the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free. The spatial discretisation combines an interior-penalty treatment of viscosity with upwind transport to control stress layers and we prove inf-sup conditions on the mixed pairs. For time-stepping, we design an IMEX scheme that is linear at each step and show well-posedness of the fully discrete problem together with a discrete energy law mirroring the continuum dissipation. Numerical experiments on canonical benchmarks (lid-driven cavity, pipe-with-cavity and $4{:}1$ planar contraction) demonstrate accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities while retaining the efficiency gains of the uniaxial model. The results indicate that de Rham-compatible discretisations coupled with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity.

### [9] [Enriched Galerkin Method for Navier-Stokes Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20240)
*Chun Song,Minfu Feng*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: An enriched Galerkin finite element method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using continuous linear velocity spaces with bubble functions, achieving local conservation while maintaining efficiency of low-order elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a locally conservative velocity approximation that retains the efficiency of low-order continuous elements while being robust for small viscosities and pressure-independent accuracy.

Method: Augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, uses symmetric interior penalty for viscous term, stable pressure space for divergence constraint, and introduces reconstruction operator for pressure-robustness.

Result: Optimal a priori error estimates established: first-order velocity convergence in energy norm, second-order in L² norm, and first-order pressure convergence. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical rates and accurately capture flow structures.

Conclusion: The proposed EG scheme is effective and robust for incompressible flow simulation, demonstrating accurate flow structure capture with proven convergence rates and pressure-robust properties.

Abstract: This paper presents an enriched Galerkin (EG) finite element method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure. The proposed EG scheme accurately captures characteristic flow structures, illustrating its effectiveness and robustness for incompressible flow simulation.

*Maarten V. de Hoop,Nikola B. Kovachki,Matti Lassas,Nicholas H. Nelsen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Neural operator approximation for Calderón's inverse conductivity problem in EIT with noise-robust framework, using Fourier neural operators to reconstruct conductivities from noisy boundary measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a noise-robust neural operator framework for solving Calderón's inverse conductivity problem in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with noisy boundary measurements.

Method: Extend the inversion operator's domain to a Hilbert space of kernel functions, enabling neural operator approximation. Use Fourier neural operators to reconstruct conductivities from noisy Neumann-to-Dirichlet map data.

Result: Fourier neural operators successfully reconstruct infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups, both within and beyond theoretical assumptions.

Conclusion: The methodology provides a noise-aware operator learning framework for nonlinear inverse problems, with successful application to EIT demonstrating broader applicability to similar inverse problems.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of noise-robust neural operator approximation for the solution map of Calderón's inverse conductivity problem. In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework.

### [11] [Efficient thermal simulation in metal additive manufacturing via semi-analytical isogeometric analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20432)
*Yang Yang,Ye Ji,Matthias Möller,Can Ayas*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel semi-analytical thermal modeling approach for LPBF using Isogeometric Analysis that combines analytical point-source solutions with spline-based numerical corrections for efficient and accurate temperature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional FEM struggles with LPBF's steep thermal gradients, requiring expensive mesh refinement. Existing semi-analytical methods have limitations in handling complex geometries efficiently.

Method: Reformulates semi-analytical framework using IGA: analytical point-source captures laser heat, while spline-based IGA discretization solves correction field for boundary conditions using NURBS basis functions and implicit time integration.

Result: Method delivers accurate temperature predictions, eliminates scan-wise remeshing, handles complex geometric features, and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains over standard FEM.

Conclusion: The semi-analytical IGA method establishes a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF, offering superior efficiency and accuracy for complex part geometries.

Abstract: Thermal modeling of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is challenging due to steep, rapidly moving thermal gradients induced by the laser, which are difficult to resolve accurately with conventional Finite Element Methods. Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $θ$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed semi-analytical IGA method delivers accurate temperature predictions and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to standard FEM, establishing it as a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF.

*Daniel Bach,Andrés M. Rueda-Ramírez,Eric Sonnendrücker,David C. Del Rey Fernández,Gregor J. Gassner*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Extends Finite Element Exterior Calculus strategy to Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference methods to create divergence- and curl-free discretizations using integral and nodal degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve divergence- and curl-free discretizations in SBP-FD methods, which lack known basis functions unlike traditional FEEC approaches.

Method: Constructs compatible operators using integral and nodal degrees of freedom through analytic relationships, leveraging pre-existing SBP-FD matrix operators to derive nodal values from integral degrees of freedom.

Result: Successfully demonstrates that FEEC strategies can be transferred to SBP-FD methods to obtain schemes with desired divergence- and curl-free properties.

Conclusion: The approach enables compatible discretizations in SBP-FD methods despite the absence of explicit basis functions, extending FEEC principles to finite difference frameworks.

Abstract: We demonstrate that we can carry over the strategy of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) to Summation-by-Parts (SBP) Finite Difference (FD) methods to achieve divergence- and curl-free discretizations. This is not obvious at first sight, as for SBP-FD no basis functions are known, but only values and derivatives at points. The key is a remarkable analytic relationship that enables us to construct compatible operators using integral and nodal degrees of freedom. Pre-existing SBP-FD matrix operators can then be used to obtain nodal values from the integral degrees of freedom to derive a scheme with the desired properties.

*Gianluca Giacchi,Davide Tramontana*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous microlocal analysis was limited to restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions with specific structural properties, leaving general cases unexamined.

Method: Use metaplectic Wigner distributions and Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase to analyze microlocal properties and phase space concentration in Schrödinger equations.

Result: Successfully extended microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions and analyzed phase space concentration of cross-Wigner distributions from state interactions in Schrödinger evolutions.

Conclusion: The framework enables refined study of ghost frequencies and provides comprehensive microlocal analysis tools for all metaplectic Wigner distributions in Schrödinger equation contexts.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microlocal properties of the evolutions of Schrödinger equations using metaplectic Wigner distributions. So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schrödinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.

### [14] [Higher integrability for parabolic PDEs with generalized Orlicz growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19758)
*Peter Hästö,Jihoon Ok*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Higher integrability of gradients for weak solutions to nonlinear parabolic systems with generalized Young function growth conditions, unifying various growth cases including p-growth, variable exponent, double phase, and new borderline cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified framework for proving higher integrability of gradients in nonlinear parabolic systems that encompasses various growth conditions (p-growth, variable exponent, double phase) and handles both singular and degenerate cases simultaneously.

Method: Uses an (A1)-condition for comparing the generalized Young function φ between points in intrinsic parabolic cylinders, providing a unified approach. Develops a reverse Hölder type inequality that works for both singular and degenerate cases.

Result: Proves higher integrability of the gradient for weak solutions, covering known special cases (p-growth, variable exponent, double phase) and new borderline cases (borderline double phase growth, perturbed variable exponent growth).

Conclusion: The (A1)-condition provides a unifying framework for disparate growth conditions in nonlinear parabolic systems, with a novel reverse Hölder inequality that simultaneously handles singular and degenerate cases, offering new results even for classical p-growth problems.

Abstract: We prove higher integrability of the gradient of weak solutions to nonlinear parabolic systems whose prototype is \[ \partial_t u-\mathrm{div}\Big(\frac{\varphi'(z, |\nabla u|)}{|\nabla u|}\nabla u\Big) =0, \qquad u=(u^1,\dots,u^N), \] where $\varphi$ is a generalized Young function. Special cases of our main theorem include previously known results for the $p$-growth, the variable exponent and the double phase growth. Also included are previously unknown borderline double phase growth and perturbed variable exponent growth, among others. The problem is controlled by a natural requirement of comparison of $\varphi$ between points in intrinsic parabolic cylinders via an (A1)-condition, which unifies disparate conditions from the special cases. Moreover, we handle both the singular and degenerate cases at the same time, providing a simple proof of a reverse Hölder type inequality, which is new even in the $p$-growth case.

*Benoît Bonnet-Weill,Alberto Domínguez Corella,Hélène Frankowska*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Establishes viability conditions for continuity inclusions in 1-Wasserstein space, with different results depending on dynamics regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when solutions to continuity inclusions remain within constraints over time in the 1-Wasserstein space.

Method: Two proof strategies: one for Lipschitz dynamics using graphical derivatives, another for upper semicontinuous dynamics using Aumann integrals.

Result: For Lipschitz dynamics: viability requires intersection with graphical derivative. For upper semicontinuous dynamics: sufficient condition involves Aumann integral behavior.

Conclusion: Different viability conditions apply based on the regularity of the dynamics in the measure variable.

Abstract: In this article, we establish necessary and sufficient viability conditions for continuity inclusions over the 1-Wasserstein space. Depending on the regularity properties of the dynamics, we derive two results which are based on fairly different proof strategies. When the admissible velocities are Lipschitz in the measure variable, we show that it is necessary and sufficient for viable solutions to exist that the latter intersect the graphical derivative of the constraints. On the other hand, when the admissible velocities are merely upper semicontinuous in the measure variable, we provide a sufficient condition for viability involving the infinitesimal behaviour of their Aumann integral over a neighbouring set of measures.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive ODE theory framework for structured continuity equations in fibred probability spaces, extending meanfield theory to nonexchangeable systems with rigorous mathematical foundations.

Abstract: In this article, we develop a comprehensive ODE-theory for structured continuity equations in fibred probability spaces, which represent a class of heterogeneous PDEs arising as the meanfield limit nonexchangeable particle systems. After investigating in depth the topologies induced by the so-called fibred and classical Wasserstein metrics on such probability spaces, we establish quantitative Cauchy-Lipschitz and qualitative Carathéodory-Peano well-posedness results for structured continuity equations, along with precise correspondences between this class of evolutions, classical Lagrangian dynamics, and continuity equations. In keeping with what has long been known for exchangeable dynamics, we derive a general meanfield approximation result by solutions of nonexchangeable particle systems, along with a quantitative variant thereof under practically reasonable regularity assumptions on the driving field and initial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate geometric properties of domains through overdetermined elliptic problems and provide partial proofs for the Berenstein and Schiffer conjectures about domain characterization.

Method: Analyzes overdetermined elliptic problems with different boundary conditions on convex, centrally symmetric domains in R² with smooth boundaries, examining when nontrivial solutions exist for sufficiently large eigenvalues.

Result: Shows that if the overdetermined problems have nontrivial solutions for sufficiently large eigenvalues, then the domain Ω must be a disk, providing partial affirmative answers to both conjectures.

Conclusion: The results establish connections between spectral properties of elliptic operators and geometric shapes of domains, confirming that under specific boundary conditions and sufficiently large eigenvalues, only circular domains admit nontrivial solutions.

Abstract: Let $Ω$ be a bounded, convex, centrally symmetric in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with a connected $C^{2,ε}$ ($ε\in(0,1)$) boundary. We show that, if the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -Δu=αu\,\, \text{in}\,\,Ω, \,\, u=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partialΩ,\,\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partialΩ\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution corresponding to a sufficiently large eigenvalue $α$, then $Ω$ is a disk, which is the partially affirmative answer to the Berenstein conjecture. Similarly, we show that, if $Ω$ has a Lipschitz connected boundary and the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -Δu=αu\,\, \text{in}\,\,Ω, \,\, \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partialΩ,\,\,u =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partialΩ\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution corresponding to a sufficiently large eigenvalue $α$, then $Ω$ is also a disk, which is the partially affirmative answer to the Schiffer conjecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the connection between quantum Boltzmann and Landau operators in the weak-coupling regime, extending classical results to quantum statistics and capturing quantum effects in the limit.

Method: Uses a new two-parameter scaling approach inspired by Benedetto-Pulvirenti's classical derivation, specifically designed to preserve quantum effects and capture the ternary term in the quantum Landau operator.

Result: Successfully derives the quantum Landau operator as the weak-coupling limit of the quantum Boltzmann operator for both Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, with explicit convergence rates depending on interaction potential regularity.

Conclusion: The quantum Landau operator can be rigorously obtained from the quantum Boltzmann operator through appropriate scaling, with quantum statistics preserved in the limit and convergence rates explicitly characterized.

Abstract: In this manuscript we derive the quantum Landau operator as the weak-coupling limit of the quantum Boltzmann operator (also known as the Uehling-Uhlenbeck operator). We consider both Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. Our approach is inspired by the work by Benedetto and Pulvirenti, where the classical Landau operator was derived from the quantum Boltzmann operator. To capture the ternary term in the quantum Landau operator, we introduce a new two-parameter scaling that preserves the quantum effects in the limit. Furthermore, we provide an explicit rate of convergence that depends on the regularity of the interaction potential.

*Yilin Song,Jiqiang Zheng,Ruihan Zhou*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Control and stabilization of fourth-order Schrödinger equations on compact manifolds without boundary for dimensions 1-5, using geometric control condition and semiclassical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend control and stabilization results for fourth-order Schrödinger equations to higher dimensions (up to 5) and remove the unique continuation assumption required in previous work.

Method: Combined Loyola's method with semiclassical analysis for dimensions 1-4; for dimension 5 (specifically S^5), used propagation of singularity in Bourgain space.

Result: Proved stabilization under geometric control condition (GCC) for dimensions 1-4 without unique continuation assumption; extended similar control and stabilization results to dimension 5 in energy space.

Conclusion: Successfully generalized control and stabilization theory for fourth-order Schrödinger equations to higher dimensions, removing previous limitations and extending Laurent's results.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the control and stabilization problem for a class of fourth-order Schrödinger equation on compact manifold without boundary with dimensions $d\in[1,5]$:
  \begin{align*}
  i\partial_tu+(Δ_g^2-βΔ_g)u=|u|^{2k}u,
  \end{align*}
  where $k\in\Bbb N$.
  For $1\leq d\leq4$ and $k\geq1$, we combine the method proposed by Loyola and semiclassical analysis to prove the stabilization result only under the geometric control condition (GCC), which removes the unique continuation assumption in Capistrano-Filho-Pampu [Math. Z. (2022)]. For $d=5$, we focus on a special case, i.e. $\Bbb S^5$. Establishing the propagation of singularity in Bourgain space, we prove the similar control and stabilization result in energy space as lower dimensions, which generalizes the result of Laurent [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2009)].

TL;DR: Spectral analysis of Boltzmann equation in 3D infinite layer with diffuse reflection boundaries, establishing sharp asymptotic convergence to 2D heat equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyze Boltzmann equation behavior around Maxwellians in 3D infinite layer geometry where Fourier transform fails and collision operator loses compactness due to boundary conditions.

Method: Introduce regularization operator via finite-dimensional Fourier series truncation, study spectrum of linearized problem, establish resolvent estimates, identify leading diffusive eigenvalue.

Result: Spectral structure governs asymptotic dynamics, enabling construction of large-time behavior and proving faster convergence to 2D heat equation solution in horizontal direction.

Conclusion: Developed spectral theory successfully analyzes sharp asymptotic behavior of Boltzmann equation in complex boundary geometry, establishing rigorous convergence results.

Abstract: In the paper, we develop spectral theory to analyze the sharp asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Boltzmann equation around global Maxwellians in a three-dimensional infinite layer $\mathbb{R}^2\times (-1,1)$. The isothermal diffuse reflection boundary condition is imposed on two parallel infinite planes at $x_3=\pm 1$. The main difficulties lie in the fact that the direct Fourier transform is not applicable to the vertical $x_3$-variable, and the linear collision operator $K$ loses its compactness on $L^2((-1,1)\times \R^3_v)$ although it is compact on $L^2(\R^3_v)$. By introducing a regularization operator $K_n$ via the finite-dimensional Fourier series truncation in $L^2(-1,1)$, we study the spectrum of the linearized initial-boundary value approximation problem, establish the resolvent estimates, and identify the leading diffusive eigenvalue. This spectral structure governs the sharp asymptotic dynamics of the original linear problem as $n\to \infty$, enabling us to construct the large-time behavior for the nonlinear problem and rigorously prove that the solution converges with a faster rate toward that of the two-dimensional heat equation in the horizontal direction.

Motivation: To extend density results for smooth approximation from W^{1,1} Sobolev spaces to higher-order Sobolev spaces W^{1,p} with integer p≥2, providing counterparts to existing results.

Method: The authors use techniques involving limits of sequences of smooth maps with equi-integrable Sobolev energy, and also provide an alternative proof based on the weak continuity of Jacobians in cases where the cohomological criterion of Bethuel, Demengel, Colon and Hélein applies.

Result: Successfully proved that strong approximation by smooth maps is possible for limits of sequences with equi-integrable W^{1,p}-Sobolev energy, extending the result to higher-order Sobolev spaces and showing straightforward applicability in fractional Sobolev spaces.

Conclusion: The paper establishes density results for smooth approximation in higher-order Sobolev spaces W^{1,p} with integer p≥2, generalizing previous work and providing multiple approaches including one based on weak continuity of Jacobians.

Abstract: We show that limits of sequences of smooth maps between compact Riemannian manifolds with equi-integrable $W^{1, p}$-Sobolev energy can always be strongly approximated by smooth maps, giving a counterpart of Hang's density result in $W^{1, 1}$ for the Sobolev space $W^{1, p}$ with integer $p \ge 2$. Our result extends to higher-order Sobolev spaces and is straightforward in fractional Sobolev spaces. We also provide a proof based on the weak continuity of Jacobians in the cases where the cohomological criterion of Bethuel, Demengel, Colon and Hélein applies.

TL;DR: Homogenization of Laplace's equation in periodically perforated domains with Robin boundary conditions shows a critical regime where the homogenized equation gains a nonlinear zero-order term dependent on the Robin coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Robin boundary conditions in periodically perforated domains affect homogenization, particularly when the Robin coefficient scales inversely with the total surface area of holes.

Method: Analysis of Laplace's equation with Robin boundary conditions using homogenization techniques, studying solutions to a Steklov-type spectral problem where eigenvalues appear in both the equation and boundary conditions.

Result: In the critical regime, the homogenized equation contains an additional zero-order term that depends nonlinearly on the Robin coefficient. This term vanishes as the Robin parameter approaches zero and converges to the capacitary term for Dirichlet problems as the parameter approaches infinity.

Conclusion: Robin boundary conditions in periodically perforated domains lead to a nontrivial homogenization limit with a nonlinear strange term that bridges between Neumann and Dirichlet behavior depending on the Robin parameter.

Abstract: We consider Laplace's equation in a periodically perforated domain, with Robin boundary conditions on the holes and a Robin coefficient inversely proportional to the total surface area of the holes. We show that, in a certain critical regime, the homogenised equation contains an additional zero-order term, which depends nonlinearly on the Robin coefficient. This additional term is defined in terms of solutions to a Steklov-type spectral problem, where the eigenvalue appears both in the equation and the boundary conditions. The ``strange term'' for the problem with Robin conditions converges to zero as the Robin parameter tends to zero and, at least under suitable assumptions, it converges to the capacitary ``strange term'' for the Dirichlet problem as the Robin parameter tends to infinity.

Motivation: To study a Schrödinger equation with a damping term involving the Riemann zeta function, connecting number theory with PDE analysis.

Method: Used distribution theory for uniqueness, regularization for existence, energy estimates, compactness arguments, and weak solution verification.

Result: Proved uniqueness of solutions in distribution sense, global existence in H^1 space, and provided explicit mass estimates for the limiting case.

Conclusion: Successfully established well-posedness for the zeta-damped Schrödinger equation and derived important mass conservation properties.

Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem in the space $H^1(Σ)$ for a nonlinear damped Schrödinger equation of the form \[ i u_t + Δu + i λu \, ζ(|u|+1) = 0, \quad u(0,x) = u_0, \] where $ζ$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. This equation involves a damping term inspired by a fundamental object from number theory. We first establish the uniqueness of solutions in the sense of distributions. Then, by considering a regularized problem, we prove the existence of a global solution in $H^1(Σ)$, using uniform energy estimates and compactness arguments. Finally, we show that the limiting solution indeed satisfies the original equation in the weak sense,In the last part of this work, we provide an explicit estimate for the mass associated with the equation \begin{equation}\tag{E0}\label{5454} i v_t + Δv + iλ\frac{v}{|v|} = 0, \qquad v(0,x)=v_0.

TL;DR: Study of asymptotic behavior of least energy solutions to nearly critical nonlocal problems in bounded domains, showing blow-up at exactly one point characterized by Robin's function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the blow-up behavior and exact location of singular points for solutions to nonlocal critical exponent problems as parameters approach critical values.

Method: Analysis of the nonlocal problem with convolution term, studying asymptotic behavior as ε→0, characterizing blow-up points through Robin's function properties.

Result: Least energy solutions blow up at exactly one point x₀, which is characterized as a global maximum of Robin's function; exact blow-up rates and shape are determined.

Conclusion: The blow-up point for nearly critical nonlocal problems is precisely located at the global maximum of Robin's function, providing complete characterization of singular behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we study that the nearly critical nonlocal problem \begin{equation*} \left\lbrace \begin{aligned}
  &-Δu=(|x|^{-{(n-2)}}\ast u^{p-ε})u^{p-1-ε} \quad \mbox{in}\quad Ω,

  We study the asymptotic behavior of least energy solutions as $ε\rightarrow0$. These solutions are shown to blow-up at exactly one point $x_0$ and location of this point is characterized. In addition, the shape and exact rates for blowing-up are studied. Finally, in order to further locate the blowing-up point $x_0$, we prove that $x_0$ is a global maximum point of the Robin's function of $Ω$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability of energy solutions in capillary systems and how volume constraints evolve as the container-to-plate ratio becomes large, connecting finite-ratio problems to volume-unconstrained Dirichlet-forced evolution.

Method: Using comparison principle techniques for the prescribed mean curvature equation with capillary contact angle condition, along with barrier arguments to develop energy asymptotics independent of container-to-plate ratio.

Result: Demonstrated stability of energy solutions as container width to plate width ratio goes to infinity, showing that volume constraints disappear in the limit, leading to a volume-unconstrained Dirichlet-forced evolution.

Conclusion: The study successfully connects finite-ratio capillary problems to established volume-unconstrained settings, providing control over energy asymptotics independent of geometric ratios and enabling application of existing monotonicity, uniqueness, and contact line regularity results.

Abstract: We study a rate independent energetic model of the Wilhelmy plate experiment in capillarity. The evolution is driven by vertical motions of the plate. We show stability of energy solutions to the evolution, in the sense used in the rate-independent systems literature, as the ratio between container width and plate width goes to infinity. In particular, we show that the volume-constraint for the finite-ratio problem disappears in the limit. This leads to a volume-unconstrained Dirichlet-forced evolution, a setting where monotonicity, uniqueness, and contact line regularity properties have been established in previous literature.
  Our result is based on using comparison principle techniques for the prescribed mean curvature equation with capillary contact angle condition that characterizes the liquid surface at equilibrium. Through barrier arguments, we are able to develop asymptotics for the energy which give us control independent of the container-to-plate ratio.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies Dirac operators on spin manifolds with boundary, defines a boundary conjugation map, and shows it can recover geometric data like the metric and connection from boundary information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how boundary data from Dirac operators can determine the interior geometry of spin manifolds, extending inverse problems to spinor settings.

Method: Define a boundary conjugation map for Dirac operators with chiral boundary conditions, analyze it as a pseudodifferential operator, and use its symbol to reconstruct geometric data.

Result: In dimensions >2, the symbol determines the Taylor series of metric and connection on the boundary. For real-analytic manifolds, the full geometry can be recovered from the boundary map.

Conclusion: Boundary conjugation maps provide sufficient information to reconstruct spin manifolds and their geometric structures under certain conditions, with applications to inverse problems.

Abstract: We consider on a spin manifold with boundary a Dirac operator $D_A$ with chiral boundary conditions, twisted by a unitary connection $A$. When $m$ is not in the chiral spectrum of $D_A$, we define an analogue of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Dirac equation $D_A - m$, which we call the boundary conjugation map, and show that it is a pseudodifferential operator of order $0$ on the boundary. We show that in dimension greater than 2, its symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric and connection modulo gauge on the boundary when $m \neq 0$ and $m^2$ is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of $D_A^2$. We go on to show that a real-analytic Riemannian manifold and twisted spinor bundle with twisted spin connection can be recovered from its boundary conjugation map. Under further hypotheses, one can recover the unitary connection up to global gauge equivalence and the complex spinor bundles. Similar results hold in dimension $2$ when the auxiliary bundle and connection are absent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study positive solutions of Laplace equations with gradient terms on complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds and establish Liouville-type results, particularly in critical cases where previous methods required additional integrability conditions.

Method: Using invariant tensor technique to derive key differential identities, proving Liouville theorems without requiring integrable conditions on solutions, focusing on second critical cases in dimensions n=3,4,5.

Result: Established rigidity for ambient manifolds and classification of positive solutions in second critical cases, confirming all solutions must match previously found forms. First rigidity result for equations with gradient terms in second critical case.

Conclusion: The paper successfully proves Liouville theorems for gradient-dependent Laplace equations on Riemannian manifolds, providing classification results in critical dimensions and confirming the universality of previously discovered solution forms.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate positive solutions to a class of Laplace equations with a gradient term on a complete, connected, and noncompact Riemannian manifold \((M^n,g)\) with nonnegative Ricci curvature, namely \[-Δu = f(u)|\nabla u|^q\quad\text{in }~M^n,\] where \(n\geqslant 3\), \(q>0,\) and \(f\) is a positive continuous function. We prove some Liouville theorems employing a key differential identity derived via the invariant tensor technique. In particular, for \(f(u)=u^{\frac{2-q}{n-2}(n+\frac{q}{1-q})-1}\) is the second critical case in dimension \(n=3,4,5\), without any additional conditions, such as integrable conditions on \(u\), we show the rigidity for the ambient manifold and classification result of positive solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first rigidity result for equations with gradient terms in the second critical case. Moreover, this result confirms that all solutions must be of the form found in \cite{BV-GH-V2019}.

Result: Successfully proved existence of extremals regardless of hole shape or regularity, and extended results to sets periodic in some directions and bounded in others.

Abstract: We consider periodically perforated unbounded open sets and prove existence of extremals for the relevant sharp Poincaré-Sobolev embedding constant. The existence result holds no matter the shape or the regularity of the hole: it is sufficient that the latter is a compact set with positive capacity. We also show how to apply the main result in order to get a similar existence statement, for sets which are periodic in some directions and bounded in all the others.

Motivation: To understand and classify the structure of positive solutions to the critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg groups, which has applications in mathematical physics and geometric analysis.

Method: Applied the moving plane method in integral forms and introduced H-reflection to analyze the symmetry properties of solutions. Used techniques from Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on Heisenberg groups.

Result: Proved that all positive solutions are cylindrical up to Heisenberg translation and scaling, and are CR inversion-symmetric with respect to the unit CC sphere. Established uniqueness of positive solutions.

Conclusion: The positive solutions of the critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg groups have specific symmetry properties and are unique up to the identified transformations.

Abstract: We apply the moving plane method in integral forms to classify the positive solutions of the critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg group \begin{equation}\label{0.1}
  -Δ_{\mathbb{H}}u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(ξ)|^{Q^{\ast}_μ}}{|ζ^{-1}ξ|^μ}\mathrm{d}ξ\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_μ-2}u,~~~ζ,ξ\in\mathbb{H}^{n}, \end{equation} where $Δ_{\mathbb{H}}$ denotes the Kohn Laplacian, $u(ξ)$ is a real-valued function, $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $μ\in (0,Q)$ is a real parameter and $Q^{\ast}_μ=\frac{2Q-μ}{Q-2}$ is the upper critical exponent associated with the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. By introducing the $\mathbb{H}$-reflection, we prove that the solutions of (\ref{0.1}) are cylindrical, upto Heisenberg translation and suitable scaling of function \begin{equation*}\label{0.2} u_{0}(ζ)=u_{0}(z,t)=\left((1+|z|^{2})^{2}+t^{2}\right)^{-\frac{Q-2}{4}},~~~ζ=(z,t)\in \mathbb{H}^{n}. \end{equation*} Furthermore, we show that these positive solutions are also CR inversion-symmetric with respect to the unit CC sphere. Consequently, we establish the uniqueness of positive solutions to equation (\ref{0.1}).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand similar phenomena as in Sobolev inequalities where hyperbolic space analogues are sharp in higher dimensions but not in lower dimensions (like d=3).

Method: Analyzing the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality and its hyperbolic space analogue, examining conditions for improvement based on effective dimension.

Result: Found that the inequality can be improved when the effective dimension n is in the interval [3,4).

Conclusion: The Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality exhibits a similar dimensional phenomenon as Sobolev inequalities, with improvement possible in specific effective dimension ranges.

Abstract: In the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, the sharp classical Sobolev inequality is equivalent by conformal invariance to a Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$. This inequality is sharp in dimension $d\geq 4$, but it is not in dimension $d=3$ by results of Benguria, Frank and Loss, as well as Mancini and Sandeep. In this article, we investigate a similar phenomenon for the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality and its hyperbolic analogue. In our setting, the condition for improving the inequality reads $n\in [3,4)$, where $n$ is an ``effective dimension''.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the blow-up behavior of solutions to nonlinear heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions, particularly understanding how solutions develop singularities at finite time and their asymptotic structure near blow-up points.

Method: Analysis of the nonlinear heat equation system with Neumann boundary conditions, construction of blow-up solutions using harmonic extensions and scaling parameters, and establishing asymptotic profiles near blow-up time.

Result: For any sufficiently small T>0 and any k distinct points in R^3, there exists an initial datum such that the solution blows up exactly at these points as t approaches T, with specific scaling and translation behavior.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the existence of finite-time blow-up solutions with prescribed blow-up points and provides detailed asymptotic profiles showing the structure of singularities near blow-up time.

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions $$ \begin{cases} u_{t}=Δu & \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}_{+}^{4} \times(0, T) ,\\ -\frac{d u}{d x_{4}}(\tilde{x}, 0, t) \ =u^2(\tilde{x}, 0, t)& \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{3} \times(0, T). \end{cases} $$ We establish the existence of a finite-time blow-up solution. Specifically, for any sufficiently small $T>0$ and any $k$ distinct points $q_{1},\dots,q_{k}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$, there exists an initial datum $u_{0}$ such that the corresponding solution $u(x,t)$ blows up exactly at $q_{1},\dots,q_{k}$ as $t\nearrow T$. Furthermore, when $t\nearrow T$, the solution admits the asymptotic profile $$u(x,t)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}U_{μ_{j}(t),ξ_{j}(t)}(x)+Z_0^*(x)+o(1)\quad \text{as}~ t\nearrow T,$$ where $$U_{μ_{j}(t),ξ_{j}(t)}(x):=μ_{j}^{-1}(t) U\left(\frac{x-ξ_{j}(t)}{μ_{j}(t)}\right),~ x\in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{4},$$ and $Z_{0}^{*}\in C_{0}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{4})$ satisfying $$Z_{0}^{*}(q_{j},0)<0\quad \text{for all}\ j=1,\dots,k.$$ Here, $U(y)$ denotes the harmonic extension to $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{4}$ of the positive radially symmetric solution $\widetilde{U}$ to the fractional Yamabe problem $(-Δ)^{\frac{1}{2}} \widetilde{U} = \widetilde{U}^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish well-posedness and analyticity for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations in Besov-type function spaces, addressing gaps in existing literature.

Method: Uses anisotropic Besov spaces based on Lᵖ(ℝ³) framework and requires only horizontal component of initial velocity to be small and analytic in x₃ direction.

Result: Existence of unique global solution analytic in t>0 and x∈ℝ³ under specified conditions.

Conclusion: First contribution to anisotropic Navier-Stokes well-posedness in Besov spaces with full Lᵖ(ℝ³) setting, establishing analyticity properties.

Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the real analyticity of the global solutions to the $3$D incompressible anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations. We show that if only the horizontal component of initial velocity is small and analytic in $x_3$, then there exists a unique global solution which is analytic in $t>0$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}^3$. Our functional framework lies in some anisotropic Besov spaces based on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first contribution to the well-posedness of the anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations in function spaces of the Besov type based on the full $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the decomposition behavior of breathers in nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations under small energy conditions.

Method: Proving decomposition theorems for sequences of breathers in the small energy limit.

Result: Breathers decompose into finite sum of decoupled periodically modulated canonical solitons, each asymptotically equal to sine-Gordon breathers with infinite separation distances as energy decreases.

Conclusion: Under non-resonance condition, none of these breathers is centered in a bounded set.

Abstract: For a class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, we prove that in the small energy limit, any sequence of breathers decomposes into a finite sum of decoupled, periodically modulated canonical solitons. Each of these solitons is asymptotically equal to an explicit sine-Gordon breather and the distance between them grows to infinity as the energy decreases to 0. Finally we prove that none of these breathers is centered in a bounded set provided that a certain non resonance condition holds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and correct mathematical errors in the author's previous papers from 2016 and 2014 regarding proofs that inverse scattering solutions yield classical solutions to DS II and mNV equations.

Method: Analyzing and correcting the incorrect formula for the mNV equation nonlinearity from the 2014 paper, and revising the proof methodology to ensure mathematical accuracy.

Result: Successfully corrected the errors in the proof and obtained a correct statement of the mNV equation as solved by inverse scattering.

Conclusion: The paper provides necessary corrections to previous mathematical formulations and proofs, establishing a valid foundation for the inverse scattering approach to solving the mNV equation.

Abstract: This paper corrects several errors in the author's previous papers (Journal of Spectral Theory 2016, Analysis and PDE 2014) on the Davey-Stewartson II (DS II) and modified Novikov-Veselov (mNV) equations. In each of these papers a proof was given that the solution by inverse scattering yields a classical solution to the PDE. The mNV equation lies in the integrable hierarchy of the DS II equation, so the same scattering transform may be used in both cases. In the 2014 paper, an incorrect formula is given for the nonlinearity in the mNV equation. Here we correct errors in the proof and obtain a correct statement of the mNV equation as solved by inverse scattering.

Abstract: Evacuating the powder trapped inside the complex cavities of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures remains a major challenge in metal-powder-based additive manufacturing. The Discrete Element Method offers valuable insights into this evacuation process, enabling the design of effective de-powdering strategies. In this study, we simulate gravity-driven evacuation of trapped powders from inside unit cells of various TPMS structures. We systematically investigate the role of cohesive energy density in shaping the discharge profile. Overall, we conclude that the Schwarz-P and Gyroid topologies enable the most efficient powder evacuation, remaining resilient to cohesion-induced flow hindrance. Furthermore, for the two unit cells, we analyse detailed kinematics and interpret the results in relation to particle overlaps and contact force distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious numerical mixing is a common problem in ocean models that affects simulation accuracy.

Method: Define vertical grid motion by solving an optimization problem using calculus of variations, resulting in an elliptic equation applicable to ALE vertical coordinate models.

Result: The method successfully reduces spurious mixing while maintaining physical relevance in demanding test cases like wave breaking and overturning.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient and robust approach to minimize numerical mixing in ocean models, adaptable to specific modeling needs.

Abstract: Spurious numerical mixing is a frequent phenomenon in ocean models. In the present paper, we present an efficient and robust methodology that defines the vertical grid motion so that this mixing is reduced. This motion is defined through the solution of an optimization problem that -- using the ideas of the calculus of variations -- results in an elliptic equation. This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein. The method is applied to the nonhydrostatic solver presented by the authors in [Alexandris-Galanopoulos et al., 2024] and its applicability in fully nonlinear internal waves is investigated for the demanding test cases of wave breaking and overturning. These numerical benchmarks show the ability of the method to reduce spurious mixing, while attaining the physical relevancy of the results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron dynamics is crucial for energy transfer, optoelectronics, and quantum computing, but connecting time-resolved signals to dynamics is challenging with attosecond pulses.

Method: Attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering technique applied to study coupled electron-hole dynamics in an α-sexithiophene molecule.

Result: The scattering signal contains information about the instantaneous distribution of charge density across scattering atoms.

Conclusion: This technique is promising for tracking ultrafast dynamics with atomic-scale resolution using attosecond x-ray sources.

Abstract: Improving our understanding of electron dynamics is essential for advancing energy transfer, optoelectronics, light harvesting systems and quantum computing. Recent developments in attosecond x-ray sources provide the fundamental possibility of observing these dynamics with atomic-scale resolution. However, connecting a time-resolved signal to dynamics is challenging due to the broad bandwidth of an attosecond probe pulse. This makes exploring the capabilities of different attosecond imaging techniques crucial. Here, we propose attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a prominent technique for tracking ultrafast dynamics. We demonstrate that the scattering signal contains an information about the instantaneous distribution of charge density across the scattering atoms. To illustrate this, we consider scattering from an $α$-sexithiophene molecule, in which coupled electron-hole dynamics are excited.

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve PDEs and estimate parameters for deep tunnel excavation, with active learning for optimal sensor placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce costly field measurements in tunnel excavation by developing an efficient method that can reconstruct displacement fields and determine rock parameters using limited data.

Method: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) trained with synthetic displacement data, combined with active learning using Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification to optimize sensor placement.

Result: Excellent performance on small, scattered, noisy datasets with high precision for estimating Young's moduli, shear modulus, stress ratio, and bedding plane orientation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports decision-making for subsurface monitoring and adaptive tunnel design while minimizing required field data.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning strategy to simultaneously solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and back-calculate their parameters in the context of deep tunnel excavation. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model is trained with synthetic data that emulates in situ displacement measurements in the host rock and at the cavity wall, obtained from extensometers and convergence monitoring. As acquiring field observations can be costly, a sequential training approach based on active learning is implemented to determine the most informative locations for new sensors. In particular, Monte Carlo dropout is used to quantify epistemic uncertainty and query measurements in regions where the model is least confident. This approach reduces the amount of required field data and optimizes sensor placement. The PINN is tested to reconstruct the displacement field around a deep tunnel of circular section excavated in transversely isotropic elastic rock and to determine rock constitutive and stress-field parameters. Results demonstrate excellent performance on small, scattered, and noisy datasets, achieving high precision for the Young's moduli, shear modulus, horizontal-to-vertical far-field stress ratio, and the orientation of the bedding planes. The proposed framework shall ultimately support decision-making for optimal subsurface monitoring and for adaptive tunnel design and control.

TL;DR: Bandwidth-induced temporal incoherence in broadband lasers does not significantly affect long-term inverse bremsstrahlung absorption in Au plasmas, despite transient picosecond-scale heating rate oscillations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how broadband lasers, used to mitigate laser plasma instabilities in inertial confinement fusion, affect collisional inverse bremsstrahlung heating.

Method: Used one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations benchmarked against classical absorption theory, comparing electron temperature evolution in broadband vs monochromatic cases.

Result: Spectral broadening causes transient picosecond-scale oscillations in heating rate due to stochastic intensity fluctuations, but long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged.

Conclusion: Broadband lasers maintain effective IB absorption while providing instability mitigation benefits, making them suitable for inertial confinement fusion applications.

Abstract: Broadband lasers have become a key strategy for mitigating laser plasma instabilities in inertial confinement fusion, yet their impact on collisional inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) heating remains unclear. Using one-dimensional collisional particle-in-cell simulations, we systematically examine the effect of bandwidth-induced temporal incoherence on IB absorption in Au plasmas. The simulations are first benchmarked against classical absorption theory, verifying that the implemented Coulomb collision model accurately reproduces the theoretical IB heating rate. A direct comparison of the electron temperature evolution in the broadband and monochromatic cases shows that, although spectral broadening introduces transient picosecond-scale oscillations in the heating rate driven by stochastic intensity fluctuations, the long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged.

Motivation: To investigate efficient formation of collisionless shocks in laser-produced plasmas, overcoming the high energy and time requirements of previous methods.

Method: Particle-in-cell simulations and analytical derivation of shear-flow magnetic field expression and scaling laws relating magnetic field amplitude to laser intensity.

Result: Shear-flow ion-Weibel instability generates magnetic fields that isotropize incoming flow and mediate shock formation, reducing shock formation time by 3 orders and required laser energy by 2 orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This mechanism makes production of ion-Weibel-mediated collisionless shocks feasible using existing multi-kilojoule, picosecond ultraintense laser facilities.

Abstract: The formation of ion-Weibel-mediated collisionless shocks (IW-CSs) in ultraintense-laser-produced counter-streaming plasmas is investigated using particle-in-cell simulations. Analysis of the underlying microphysics reveals that a shear-flow ion-Weibel instability generates magnetic fields, which isotropize the incoming flow and mediate shock formation. An analytical expression for the shear-flow magnetic field is derived, and a scaling law relating the magnetic field amplitude to the laser intensity is established. This mechanism reduces the shock formation time and the required laser energy by three and two orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to high-power laser experiments, making it feasible to produce IW-CSs using existing multi-kilojoule, picosecond ultraintense laser facilities.

Motivation: To improve plasma modeling by incorporating realistic electron-wall interactions including inelastic scattering and secondary electron emission.

Method: Derived boundary condition based on surface scattering kernel, implemented for Boltzmann equation using Legendre polynomial expansion method.

Result: Shows influence of inelasticity on electron behavior near silicon walls with argon, helium and oxygen plasmas; modest computational cost increase.

Conclusion: The new boundary condition provides more accurate plasma modeling and is applicable to various materials beyond the tested examples.

Abstract: We derive and implement a suitable boundary condition for the kinetic description of the electrons inside a plasma, which takes into account microphysical processes inside the wall. It is based on the surface scattering kernel, which describes the scattering cascade of the electron in the solid and the excitation of secondary electrons. The resulting boundary condition is inelastic, angle- and energy-dependent. The implementation for a Boltzmann equation solved by a Legendre polynomial expansion method is presented, elucidating the modest additional computational cost of the new boundary condition. Results, indicating the influence of the inelasticity, are shown for the example of a silicon wall facing argon, helium and oxygen plasmas, but the described construction is also valid for other materials. An effective reflection coefficient is defined to compare the results with previously used boundary conditions.

Motivation: Polarons strongly influence electronic and optical properties in functional materials like BiVO4, but their microscopic nature in nanostructured BiVO4 remains unresolved despite governing photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport.

Method: Using first-principles calculations to investigate polaron formation and dynamics in BiVO4.

Result: Discovery of multi-centered polarons with electron polarons exhibiting pronounced anisotropy while hole polarons remain isotropic, reflecting distinct charge-lattice coupling. Multiple in-gap states from multi-centered polarons create new channels for charge transport and recombination.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights provide direct interpretation of optical/spectroscopic experiments, offering strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO4, potentially enabling control of carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Polarons, quasiparticles formed through interactions between lattice and charge carriers (electrons and holes), strongly influence the electronic and optical properties of functional materials. In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices.

TL;DR: This study investigates the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of vanadium and niobium under high pressure using ab initio and machine learning molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex physical behaviors of group-VB transition metals under high pressure, particularly compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH), and to investigate the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH.

Method: Used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to study melting and mechanical behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure (0-250 GPa).

Result: Discovered that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb is mechanically unstable and reverts to BCC phase, leading to revised melting line determination. Nb's melting temperature significantly exceeds previous estimates. Atomic thermal displacements have greater influence on HIH than electron temperature effects. Mechanical properties transition from HIH to heating-induced softening due to competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH.

Conclusion: This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics and provides crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.

Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.

Result: Proved lower semi-continuity of Morse index and upper continuity of Morse index plus nullity, showing more stable behavior compared to harmonic maps.

Conclusion: Yang-Mills fields exhibit more stable behavior than harmonic maps, and this index control is essential for minmax operations on the Yang-Mills Lagrangian.

Abstract: We establish the lower semi continuity of the Morse index and the upper continuity of the Morse Index plus nullity of sequences of critical points of the Sacks-Uhlenbeck type relaxation of the Yang-Mills Energy in 4 dimension. The result is known not to be true in general for the ``cousin problem'' of hamonic maps from surfaces into arbitrary manifolds. This result is stressing the more stable behaviour of Yang-Mills Fields compare to harmonic maps as observed in other contexts such as the flow. The Morse Index control at the limit of critical points to Sacks Uhlenbeck relaxations of Yang-Mills Lagrangian is a central result in the implementation of minmax operation on this Lagrangian.

Motivation: To enable both structural integrity through monolithic formulation and efficient distributed simulation through decomposition.

Method: Transformation between coupled port-Hamiltonian ODE systems and monolithic formulations, with decomposition into weakly coupled subsystems.

Result: Monolithic representation ensures stability and structural integrity, while decoupled form enables efficient distributed simulation via operator splitting or dynamic iteration.

Conclusion: The approach provides a systematic framework for both monolithic and distributed simulation of port-Hamiltonian systems while preserving physical properties.

Abstract: The port-Hamiltonian framework is a structure-preserving modeling approach that preserves key physical properties such as energy conservation and dissipation. When subsystems are modeled as port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) with linearly related inputs and outputs, their interconnection remains port-Hamiltonian. This paper introduces a systematic method for transforming coupled port Hamiltonian ordinary differential equations systems (pHODE) into a single monolithic formulation, and for decomposing a monolithic system into weakly coupled subsystems. The monolithic representation ensures stability and structural integrity, whereas the decoupled form enables efficient distributed simulation via operator splitting or dynamic iteration.

TL;DR: This thesis extends stochastic modified equations (SMEs) theory for stochastic gradient optimization. It analyzes time-inhomogeneous SDEs for SGD approximation, introduces epoch Brownian motion (EBM) for SGD without replacement, and studies scaling limits of random walks with shared increments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more accurate continuous-time approximations for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms, particularly for SGD without replacement in finite-data settings, and to understand the scaling behavior of random walks with shared increments.

Method: Uses stochastic modified equations (SMEs) theory, studies time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion, introduces epoch Brownian motion (EBM) concept, applies Young differential equations (YDEs), and analyzes weak convergence of random walks with shared increments under permuton convergence.

Result: Proves 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties for certain SDEs, computes explicit linear error terms, establishes EBM as continuous-time model for SGDo, proves almost sure convergence in strongly convex setting, and shows weak convergence of random walks to Gaussian processes determined by permutons.

Conclusion: The thesis successfully extends SME theory, provides rigorous approximation results for SGD algorithms, introduces novel diffusion approximations for SGDo, and establishes connections between random walk scaling limits and permuton theory, offering improved theoretical understanding of stochastic optimization methods.

Abstract: In this thesis, we extend the recently introduced theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms.
  In Ch. 3 we study time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion. For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5.
  In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments.

TL;DR: CartNet is a graph neural network that efficiently predicts crystal properties including thermal ellipsoids (ADPs) using Cartesian coordinates and temperature, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computation of Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs) for crystal structure analysis is expensive, creating a need for more efficient prediction methods.

Method: Uses graph neural network with Cartesian coordinate encoding, neighbor equalization for covalent/contact interactions, Cholesky-based head for valid ADPs, and SO(3) rotational data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing ADP prediction methods by 10.87%, improves over theoretical approaches by 34.77%, and achieves 7.71-13.16% better results on other crystal property datasets.

Conclusion: CartNet establishes state-of-the-art performance for diverse crystal property predictions with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: In diffraction-based crystal structure analysis, thermal ellipsoids, quantified via Anisotropic Displacement Parameters (ADPs), are critical yet challenging to determine. ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet

*Misha Padidar,Teresa Huang,Andrew Giuliani,Marina Spivak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using conditional diffusion models to rapidly generate high-quality quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics like aspect ratio and rotational transform, achieving less than 5% deviation from targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stellarator design is time-consuming (hours on computing clusters), and machine learning approaches using large datasets of optimized stellarators can accelerate fusion research by generating designs rapidly.

Method: Train a conditional diffusion model on QUASR database data to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with specific characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform), applied to unseen characteristics during training.

Result: Generated stellarators show solid performance with less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and target characteristics, with potential to reach sub 1% target.

Conclusion: Generative modeling, particularly conditional diffusion models, offers promising avenues for advancing stellarator design by rapidly producing high-quality configurations.

Abstract: Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design.

TL;DR: CHONKNORIS is a neural operator learning method that achieves machine precision by regressing Cholesky factors of elliptic operators in Newton-Kantorovich updates, rather than directly approximating solution operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator methods often fail to significantly outperform simpler approaches like kernel methods, lacking the ability to achieve high precision needed for scientific computing applications.

Method: Regresses Cholesky factors of elliptic operators in Tikhonov-regularized Newton-Kantorovich updates, creating an unrolled iterative system that achieves contractive mapping for high precision.

Result: Achieves machine precision on various nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems including elliptic equations, Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, Calderón problem, wave scattering, and seismic imaging.

Conclusion: CHONKNORIS provides theoretical convergence guarantees and can be extended to foundation models (FONKNORIS) that solve unseen nonlinear PDEs like Klein-Gordon and Sine-Gordon equations.

Abstract: Neural operator learning methods have garnered significant attention in scientific computing for their ability to approximate infinite-dimensional operators. However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLINQ is a model-based algorithm that learns Whittle indices for Markov Decision Processes, outperforming Q-learning in sample efficiency and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient approach for learning Whittle indices in indexable, communicating and unichain MDPs, addressing limitations of existing Q-learning methods.

Method: Builds an empirical estimate of the MDP and computes Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art algorithm, with proven convergence guarantees.

Result: BLINQ significantly outperforms Q-learning in sample efficiency, requires fewer samples for accurate approximation, and has lower computational cost for high sample counts, even when Q-learning uses neural network acceleration.

Conclusion: BLINQ provides an effective model-based alternative to Q-learning for Whittle index learning, offering superior performance in both sample efficiency and computational complexity.

Abstract: We present BLINQ, a new model-based algorithm that learns the Whittle indices of an indexable, communicating and unichain Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach relies on building an empirical estimate of the MDP and then computing its Whittle indices using an extended version of a state-of-the-art existing algorithm. We provide a proof of convergence to the Whittle indices we want to learn as well as a bound on the time needed to learn them with arbitrary precision. Moreover, we investigate its computational complexity. Our numerical experiments suggest that BLINQ significantly outperforms existing Q-learning approaches in terms of the number of samples needed to get an accurate approximation. In addition, it has a total computational cost even lower than Q-learning for any reasonably high number of samples. These observations persist even when the Q-learning algorithms are speeded up using pre-trained neural networks to predict Q-values.

### [55] [Hearing the Serre invariant of a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20631)
*Patrick Erik Bradley,Ángel Morán Ledezma*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: The paper shows that wavelet eigenvalues of a p-adic Laplacian operator are congruent to the Serre invariant modulo q-1, and applies this to elliptic curves with split multiplicative reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect p-adic analysis with arithmetic geometry by relating Laplacian operators on p-adic manifolds to Serre invariants and elliptic curve properties.

Method: Uses kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on compact p-adic analytic manifolds, specifically applying operator Δ₀^s, and analyzes wavelet eigenvalues in relation to Serre invariants.

Result: Wavelet eigenvalues are always congruent to i(X) modulo q-1; for elliptic curves with split multiplicative reduction, the Serre invariant vanishes modulo q-1.

Conclusion: The wavelet spectrum of p-adic Laplacian operators encodes arithmetic information about Serre invariants and elliptic curve properties, providing connections between analysis and number theory.

Abstract: Using a previous novel way of defining kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators on a compact $p$-adic analytic manifold $X$, one such operator $Δ_0^s$ with $s\in\mathds{R}$ is applied to hearing the Serre invariant $i(X)$ by showing that a wavelet eigenvalue is always congruent to $i(X)$ modulo $q-1$, where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field $k$ attached to a $p$-adic number field $K$. It is shown how the number of $k$-rational points of the special fibre of the Néron model of an elliptic curve defined over $K$ relates to the wavelet spectrum of $Δ^s_0$, and this then leads to the realisation that the Serre invariant $i(E(X))$ in the case of an elliptic curve $E$ with split multiplicative reduction vanishes modulo $q-1$.
