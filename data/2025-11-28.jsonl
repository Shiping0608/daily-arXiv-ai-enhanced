Rossmanith"], "title": "A Modified BGK Collision Operator for Exact Conservation in Numerical Solutions of Boltzmann-BGK", "categories": ["math.NA"], "comment": "13 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines."}

However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering."}

Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies."}

However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena."}

For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here."}

The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself. Thus, the method avoids the need for absorbing boundary conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with up to a million sources and targets at 6-digit accuracy.

Code available at https://github.com/DJ-Fear/walrus_steering", "summary": "Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery."}

Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it.\n  The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena.\n  At $\\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \\sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed."}

Finally, we propose a well-posed finite element discretization of the model and present numerical experiments illustrating the effect of different physical parameters on the resulting membrane patterns.

Conventional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced models are attractive because of their optimality and low online cost; however, but they perform poorly when snapshots contain parameter-dependent discontinuities, leading to smeared shocks, stair-stepping, or non-physical oscillations. In $\\texttt{CRLS}$, we first map each full-order snapshot to a smoother representation by applying a one-dimensional Gaussian convolution with reflect padding along the flow field coordinates. The convolution hyperparameters (kernel width and support) are selected automatically by Bayesian optimization on a held-out set of snapshots. POD bases are then extracted from the smoothed data, and the parametric dependence of the POD coefficients is learned via radial basis function interpolation. To recover sharp shock structures, we introduce an efficient deconvolution step formulated as a regularized least squares problem, where the regularization centers the reconstruction around a nearest-neighbor reference snapshot in parameter space. The resulting $\\texttt{CRLS}$ surrogate is evaluated on inviscid transonic flow over the RAE2822 airfoil, modeled by the steady compressible Euler equations solved with SU2 over a Latin hypercube sample of Mach number and angle of attack. Compared with standard POD and smoothed-POD baselines, $\\texttt{CRLS}$ yields markedly improved shock location and strength, lower surface-pressure and field-level errors, and a $42$\\% reduction in the number of POD modes required to capture a fixed fraction of snapshot energy. These results demonstrate that $\\texttt{CRLS}$ provides an accurate, data-efficient, and largely automated route to shock-aware reduced order models for high-speed aerodynamic design."}

Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights."}

To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\\it \\small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\\mathrm{Re}\\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\\mathrm{Re}$.

Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold."}

High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability."}

By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG.

Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures."}

Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters.

For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons."}

We rigorously derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality as the singular limit of a reaction-diffusion system in the upper half-plane, where the road is modeled as a degenerate one-dimensional medium with enhanced diffusion and tangential drift. By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution. The solution is characterized by a fundamental solution constructed via optimal paths, revealing a critical transition in propagation behavior governed by a geometrically derived curve that separates rectilinear and road-assisted regimes. Our framework extends to non-order-preserving systems where classical comparison methods fail, and we provide a detailed asymptotic derivation of the Wentzell boundary condition from flux continuity principles. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to conical domains with intersecting roads, demonstrating the robustness of our variational methodology. Numerical simulations illustrate how advection and diffusion parameters shape the invaded region, highlighting the interplay between field and road dynamics in determining propagation patterns."}

In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems."}

Jakeman"], "title": "SUPN: Shallow Universal Polynomial Networks", "categories": ["cs.LG", "math.NA"], "comment": "25 pages, supplementary material", "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions."}

It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and any $ε> 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\\|H-H_k\\|_F \\leq ε\\|H\\|_F$ for $k = O(\\log n \\log(1/ε))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \\emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\\polylog(n, 1/ε)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\\log n \\log(1/ε))$ Hankel matrix $\\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \\emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\\|H - \\widehat{H}\\|_F \\leq O(\\|E\\|_F) + ε\\|H\\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \\emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \\emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices."}

Some time ago, Schottdorf proved that for small $L^2$ initial data, the mNV equation is globally well-posed. In this article, we consider instead the large data problem, using inverse scattering methods. Our main result asserts that the mNV system is globally well-posed for large $L^2$ data, with the solutions scattering as time goes to $\\pm \\infty$. One key ingredient in the proof, which is of independent interest, is a new nonlinear Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for the associated scattering transform.\n  As a byproduct of our main result, we are also able to prove a global well-posedness result for the closely related Novikov-Veselov problem at the critical $\\dot H^{-1} + L^1$ level, for a range of data which can heuristically be described as soliton-free.

The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, Mémoires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit. The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system obtained by this process appears to be new in this context.
