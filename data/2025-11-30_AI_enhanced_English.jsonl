Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy.

Most theoretical convergence results for stochastic iterative methods provide bounds on the expected error of the iterates, and yield a type of average case analysis. However, understanding the behavior of these methods in the near-worst-case is desirable. For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error.\n  Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper provides theoretical bounds on the variance and concentration of error for stochastic iterative methods, going beyond expected error analysis to understand near-worst-case behavior.", "motivation": "Stochastic iterative methods are widely used in large-scale problems but most theoretical results only provide expected error bounds.

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole.

The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, M\u00e9moires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit. The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system obtained by this process appears to be new in this context. As a byproduct of the analysis, we determine the exact dissipation rate of the granular temperature known as \\emph{Haff's law}.", "AI": {"tldr": "Rigorous derivation of incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with time-dependent forcing from inelastic hard-spheres Boltzmann equation for viscoelastic granular gases, capturing nontrivial hydrodynamic effects.", "motivation": "To derive hydrodynamic limits from the Boltzmann equation for granular gases with velocity-dependent restitution coefficients, overcoming limitations of constant restitution models where balanced dynamics must be imposed artificially.", "method": "Used self-similar change of variables that explicitly depends on Knudsen number and restitution coefficient, leading to a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge weakly to the hydrodynamic limit.", "result": "Successfully derived a new incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent time-dependent forcing terms, and determined the exact dissipation rate of granular temperature (Haff's law).", "conclusion": "The approach provides a rigorous framework for deriving hydrodynamic equations from granular gas models with velocity-dependent inelasticity, capturing essential physical effects that were previously inaccessible."}}
