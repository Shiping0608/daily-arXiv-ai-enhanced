Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions."}

As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes."}

We present a hardware-accelerated machine learning (ML) inference system integrated into the RTSTAB processing node of the DIII-D real-time diagnostic and control infrastructure.

This enables multiple classification tasks on a single FPGA design and supports adaptive control strategies that respond to evolving plasma conditions. By decoupling inference from fixed-weight configurations, the system supports continuous model refinement and seamless task switching during live operation.\n  The SNL-based inference engine is fully integrated with the FPGA in the DIII-D RTSTAB Plasma Control System (PCS), improving ELM avoidance, confinement, and operational stability.

Comput., 2011] for the single-species BGK model and is here extended to the multi-species ES-BGK setting. The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that combines the strengths of both DD-Net and DIP-Net. It has been demonstrated that this approach can recover high-quality images with fewer iteration steps. Furthermore, to address the challenge of SPI inputs having less effective information at low sampling rates, we have designed a residual block enriched with gradient information, which can convey details to deeper layers, thereby enhancing the deep network's learning capabilities. We have applied these techniques to both indoor experiments with active lighting and outdoor long-range experiments with passive lighting.

We combine this objective with a reciprocal-space basis reparameterization that stabilizes decoding for skewed or poorly conditioned lattices, and we develop a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with a method to recover orientations from very few reflections. The resulting method is memory-efficient and suitable for robust indexing. We evaluate our approach on three protein datasets from the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank collected at XFEL facilities, using identical preprocessing and unit-cell information across methods. Across all datasets, our algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers such as XGANDALF and TORO, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and for crystals with skewed unit cells. While slower, our method is extremely memory-efficient, and its structure allows high-parallelism on CPUs or larger batch sizes on GPUs. These results show that exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness."}

To perform the dimension reduction, that is, to derive the energy of a thin object by taking a suitable limit as its thickness tends to zero, we apply $Γ$-convergence-type methods to the underlying saddle-point problem.

However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are introduced to reduce long-term error accumulation and to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training, respectively. In numerical experiments on the two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems, the proposed method accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics that conventional PINNs fail to converge. It also extends to a three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity and density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing the phase-change dynamics and the formation of the pointy tip."}

A key feature of our approach is the careful design of so-called quantities of interest, defining functionals of the solution whose values the multiscale approximation aims to reproduce exactly.

We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware.

In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection.

Unlike many other fast sweeping methods, the explicit property of fixed-point fast sweeping methods provides flexibility to apply the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AWENO) scheme with unequal-sized substencils as the local solver, which facilitates the usage of arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes. Furthermore, a novel hybrid technique is designed in the local solver to combine the nonlinear AWENO interpolation with the linear scheme for an additional improvement in efficiency of the high-order fast sweeping iterations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils can achieve absolute convergence (i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine zero / round off errors) more easily than the original AWENO method with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than the popular third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time-marching approach to converge to steady state solutions."}

Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency.

The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties."}

When harnessed in steady currents, these oscillations enable the extraction of kinetic energy from the flow. However, accurately predicting these dynamics requires high-fidelity simulations that are prohibitively expensive to perform across the broad configuration space needed for design optimization. To address this, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) surrogate for the inverted foil problem, modeled as an elastically mounted rigid foil undergoing trailing-edge pitching in uniform flow. The coupled fluid-structure dynamics are solved using a Petrov-Galerkin finite element method with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, providing high-fidelity data for training and validation. The surrogate uses a rotation-equivariant, quasi-monolithic GNN architecture: structural mesh motion is compressed via proper orthogonal decomposition and advanced through a multilayer perceptron. At the same time, the GNN evolves the flow field consistent with system states. Specifically, this study extends the hypergraph framework to flexible, self-oscillating foils, capturing the nonlinear coupling between vortex dynamics and structural motion. The GNN surrogate achieves less than 1.5% error in predicting tip displacement and force coefficients over thousands of time steps, while accurately reproducing dominant vortex-shedding frequencies. The model captures energy transfer metrics within 3% of full-order simulations, demonstrating both accuracy and long-term stability. These results show a new, efficient surrogate for long-horizon prediction of unsteady flow-structure dynamics in energy-harvesting systems."}

In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model.

Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection. Through numerical experiments for MRSW moment systems up to third-order, we demonstrate that these moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency."}

In order to limit the DoF in high dimensional settings we employ operator splitting. The resulting one-dimensional advection equations can be solved efficiently and with low implementation complexity, making it a very fast alternative to standard Finite Volume methods. We compare our scheme's performance with a related Finite Volume method based on the semi-Lagrangian approach. We find that, as a consequence of its compact stencil, the AF scheme has significantly lower dissipation and reduced anisotropy, and thus produces results on par with or even superior to the benchmark for standard test cases reproducing important kinetic phenomena, while also offering lower computational cost."}

In this work we present two novel contributions: (i) an arbitrary-order time discretisation for general conservative ordinary differential equations that conserves all known invariants and (ii) an energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for both ordinary and partial differential equations written in the GENERIC format, a superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems.

Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior.

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs."}

The first-order path-conservative formulation is combined with a local solution reconstruction technique to obtain high-order spatial accuracy. The solver is tested on several benchmark two-phase flow problems to demonstrate its efficacy."}

Our construction is based on suitably rescaled Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows, each supported on long time intervals. The analysis employs perturbation theory to establish continuity of the exponential growth rate with respect to both the initial data and the diffusivity parameter.

For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity."}

Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method based on an iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics. The approach reconstructs the phase-space dynamics from the time history of the electromagnetic fields and the initial distribution functions, enabling extremely high effective resolution far below the phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data.

The method defines a relative completion within the union space $X_0 \\cup X_1$, yielding a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between the $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics.
