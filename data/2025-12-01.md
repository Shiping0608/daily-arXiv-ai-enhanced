### [1] [Concentrated real-pole uniform-in-time approximation of the matrix exponential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21858)
*Stefan Güttel,Shuai Shao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes an asymptotically optimal choice of shared concentrated real poles for rational approximants of time-dependent exponential functions exp(-tz), extending a classical result by Andersson.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop optimal rational approximations for time-dependent exponential functions exp(-tz) that work uniformly across different time intervals, extending classical results that only considered the static case exp(-z).

Method: Proposes an asymptotically optimal choice of shared concentrated real poles for a family of rational approximants, extending Andersson's classical result on asymptotic best rational approximation with real poles to the time-dependent case.

Result: Numerical experiments show near-optimality of the proposed pole choice for various time ranges and both small and large approximation degrees. The method is also applied to linear constant-coefficient initial-value problems.

Conclusion: The proposed choice of concentrated real poles provides asymptotically optimal rational approximations for time-dependent exponential functions, with practical applications in solving differential equations.

Abstract: We propose an asympotically optimal choice of shared concentrated real poles of a family of rational approximants of time-dependent exponential functions $\exp(-tz)$ for $z \geq 0$ and $t$ in a positive time interval $T$. Our result extends a classical result by J.-E.Andersson [J.Approx.Theory, 32(2):85--95, 1981] on the asymptotic best rational approximation of $\exp(-z)$ with real poles. Numerical experiments demonstrate the near-optimality of our choice for various time ranges and for both small and large approximation degrees. An application of the uniform-in-time rational approximation using our proposed concentrated real poles to a linear constant-coefficient initial-value problem is also discussed.

### [2] [Pressure-robust optimally convergent H(div) finite element method without the commuting diagram property for the steady Oseen equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21996)
*Jin Zhang,Xiaowei Liu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Convergence theory for H(div)-conforming FEMs for Oseen problem, focusing on cases where exact finite element complex holds but commuting diagram property fails, using vorticity stabilization for optimal velocity convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a convergence theory for H(div)-conforming finite element methods for the steady Oseen problem that works even when the commuting diagram property fails, enabling more efficient discretizations for incompressible fluid problems, especially at high Reynolds numbers.

Method: Uses H(div)-conforming finite elements with vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order velocity convergence. Leverages exact de Rham and finite element complexes to establish velocity error estimates independent of discrete inf-sup constant. Demonstrates with Stenberg finite elements as representative example.

Result: The framework provides optimal-order convergence of velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. Stenberg elements demonstrate pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT/BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring commuting diagram property.

Conclusion: The methodology enables efficient discretizations for incompressible fluid problems, particularly at high Reynolds numbers, by working with finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, opening new possibilities for computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: This work develops a convergence theory for H(div)-conforming finite element methods applied to the steady Oseen problem, focusing on cases where the exact finite element complex holds while the commuting diagram property may fail. The proposed method incorporates vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order convergence of the velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes.

### [3] [BDF2-type integrator for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in micromagnetics, part I: unconditional weak convergence to weak solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22000)
*Michele Aldé,Michael Feischl,Dirk Praetorius*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A finite element method with BDF2 time-stepping for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, requiring only one linear solve per time step, proven unconditionally stable with weak convergence to LLG solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation that models micromagnetic phenomena, with the goal of creating a stable discretization that requires minimal computational effort per time step while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Full discretization using first-order finite elements in space and a BDF2-type two-step method in time. Linear interpolation reconstructs discrete space-time magnetization. Only one linear system needs solving per time step.

Result: The integrator is proven unconditionally stable, guaranteeing that a subsequence of reconstructed magnetization converges weakly in H¹ towards a weak solution of LLG. Numerical experiments confirm first-order spatial and second-order temporal accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient, stable numerical scheme for LLG with proven convergence properties and verified accuracy through numerical experiments, making it suitable for micromagnetic simulations.

Abstract: We consider the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG) that models time-dependent micromagnetic phenomena. We propose a full discretization that employs first-order finite elements in space and a BDF2-type two-step method in time. In each time step, only one linear system of equations has to be solved. We employ linear interpolation in time to reconstruct the discrete space-time magnetization. We prove that the integrator is unconditionally stable and thus guarantees that a subsequence of the reconstructed magnetization converges weakly in $H^1$ towards a weak solution of LLG in the space-time domain. Numerical experiments verify that the proposed integrator is indeed first-order in space and second-order in time.

### [4] [Broken-FEEC on multipatch domains with local refinements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22206)
*Martin Campos Pinto,Frederik Schnack*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel broken-FEEC approach for locally refined spline spaces with non-matching interfaces using moment-preserving discrete conforming projection operators to eliminate numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional broken-FEEC allows discontinuous discretizations but local refinements cause numerical artifacts. Need to extend broken-FEEC to locally refined spline spaces with non-matching interfaces while preserving computational benefits.

Method: Develop explicit, localized, metric-independent moment-preserving discrete conforming projection operators that ensure H¹ and H(curl) continuity across non-matching interfaces while preserving high-order polynomial moments.

Result: Broken-FEEC de Rham sequences with accurate strong and weak derivatives, leading to energy-preserving Maxwell solvers that are explicit and virtually free of spurious modes. Numerical simulations confirm elimination of spurious waves.

Conclusion: The novel approach successfully extends broken-FEEC to locally refined spline spaces with non-matching interfaces, eliminating numerical artifacts through moment-preserving projection operators, resulting in robust Maxwell solvers without spurious modes.

Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach for broken-FEEC (Finite Element Exterior Calculus), extending its application to locally refined spline spaces with non-matching interfaces. Traditional broken-FEEC allows for discontinuous discretizations at patch interfaces, preserving the de Rham structure and offering computational benefits. However, local refinements often lead to numerical artifacts. Our solution involves developing moment-preserving discrete conforming projection operators. These operators are explicit, localized, and metric-independent, ensuring $H^1$ and $H(\text{curl})$ continuity across non-matching interfaces while preserving high-order polynomial moments. This results in broken-FEEC de Rham sequences with accurate strong and weak derivatives, leading to energy-preserving Maxwell solvers that are explicit and virtually free of spurious modes. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy of our method in eliminating spurious waves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The implicit definition of Virtual Element spaces creates computational issues for intergrid operators in multigrid methods, making it difficult to implement efficient multigrid schemes on polygonal meshes.

Method: Proposes a non-nested W-cycle multigrid scheme that uses a fully-conforming auxiliary space constructed by computing virtual basis functions via the reduced basis method, avoiding the implicit definition problem.

Result: The scheme successfully enables multigrid methods for Virtual Element Method on polygonal meshes by providing a practical way to compute intergrid operators through the auxiliary space approach.

Conclusion: The reduced basis method provides an effective way to construct virtual basis functions, enabling efficient multigrid schemes for Virtual Element Method while overcoming the computational challenges of implicit space definitions.

Abstract: We present a non-nested W-cycle multigrid scheme for the lowest order Virtual Element Method on polygonal meshes. To avoid the implicit definition of the Virtual Element space, which poses several issues in the computation of intergrid operators that underpin multigrid methods, the proposed scheme uses a fully-conforming auxiliary space constructed by cheaply computing the virtual basis functions via the reduced basis method.

### [6] [High-Order Asymptotic-Preserving IMEX schemes for an ES-BGK model for Gas Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22304)
*Domenico Caparello,Lorenzo Pareschi,Thomas Rey*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: High-order AP IMEX scheme for multi-species ES-BGK model with explicit time stepping, uniform stability across Knudsen numbers, and consistent fluid limit solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a high-order numerical scheme for the ES-BGK model of gas mixtures that can handle stiffness from relaxation terms and work efficiently across different flow regimes (kinetic to fluid).

Method: Extends IMEX strategy from single-species BGK to multi-species ES-BGK; uses third-order time integration, CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction, exact conservation of macroscopic moments, and multithreaded implementation; removes stiffness via IMEX structure.

Result: Constructed fully explicit, uniformly stable scheme with hyperbolic CFL constraint only; handles arbitrary number of species; demonstrates AP property and correct asymptotics in multidimensional kinetic tests.

Conclusion: Successfully developed high-order AP IMEX scheme for gas mixtures that efficiently bridges kinetic and fluid regimes while maintaining accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this work we construct a high-order Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme for the ES-BGK model for gas mixtures introduced in [Brull, Commun. Math. Sci., 2015]. The time discretization is based on the IMEX strategy proposed in [Filbet, Jin, J. Sci. Comput., 2011] for the single-species BGK model and is here extended to the multi-species ES-BGK setting. The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation. The proposed approach can handle an arbitrary number of species. Its accuracy and robustness are demonstrated on a set of multidimensional kinetic tests for gas mixtures, where the AP property and the correct asymptotics are numerically verified across different regimes.

### [7] [Weyl distributions, spectral properties, and circulant approximation results for quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22422)
*Ayoub Lailoune,Valerio Loi,Stefano Serra-Capizzano*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper extends eigenvalue and singular value distribution theory to quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrices, develops approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) for quaternion matrices, and applies these results to preconditioning methods for large quaternion linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address large quaternion linear systems from modern applications by developing theoretical foundations for preconditioning and matrix approximation, extending classical Toeplitz matrix theory to the quaternion case.

Method: Extends Weyl eigenvalue and singular value distribution theory to quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrices; develops approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) for quaternion matrix sequences; uses quaternion block multilevel circulant matrices as a.c.s. for Toeplitz matrices.

Result: Comprehensive treatment of eigenvalue/singular value distributions for quaternion Toeplitz matrices; extension of a.c.s. theory to quaternion matrices; decomposition of matrix differences into low-norm plus low-rank terms; foundation for fast preconditioning methods.

Conclusion: The developed theory provides mathematical foundations for efficient preconditioning of large quaternion linear systems, with numerical experiments validating the approach and suggesting directions for future research.

Abstract: The present work contains a comprehensive treatment of Weyl eigenvalue and singular value distributions for single-axis quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences generated by $s\times t$ quaternion matrix-valued, $d$-variate, Lebesgue integrable generating functions. Furthermore, in view of concrete applications, we are interested in preconditioning and matrix approximation results. To this end, a crucial step is the extension of the notion of an approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) to the case of matrix sequences with quaternion entries, since it allows us to decompose the difference between a matrix and its preconditioner into low-norm plus (relatively) low-rank terms. As a specific example, we consider classes of quaternion block multilevel circulant matrix sequences as an a.c.s. for quaternion block multilevel Toeplitz matrix sequences. These approximation results lay the foundations for fast preconditioning methods when dealing with large quaternion linear systems stemming from modern applications. We conclude our study with numerical experiments and directions for future research.

### [8] [Parabolic hysteresis problems revisited: Finite element error analysis and convergent Newton-type solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22424)
*Shu Xu,Liqun Cao*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: First rigorous finite element error analysis for parabolic PDEs with hysteresis, plus efficient damped smoothing Newton solver with proven convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on PDEs with hysteresis focused on simulations without numerical error analysis, and used derivative-free nonlinear solvers. There's a need for rigorous error estimates and efficient solvers for these nonsmooth systems.

Method: Developed finite element error estimates for backward Euler fully discrete scheme for semilinear/quasilinear parabolic equations with hysteresis. Created damped smoothing Newton solver with general smoothing approximation condition to handle nonsmoothness.

Result: Theoretical convergence rates confirmed for semilinear problems; quasilinear problems showed higher-than-predicted convergence orders. Proposed solver demonstrated robustness and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: First rigorous error analysis for hysteresis PDEs with efficient solver that handles nonsmoothness, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical computational advantages.

Abstract: Numerical investigations of partial differential equations with hysteresis have largely focused on simulations, leaving numerical error analysis unexplored and relying mainly on derivative-free nonlinear solvers. This work establishes rigorous finite element error estimates for the backward Euler fully discrete scheme applied to semilinear and quasilinear parabolic equations involving continuous hysteresis operators. To efficiently handle the inherent nonsmoothness of the resulting nonlinear algebraic systems, we develop a damped smoothing Newton solver under a general condition on the smoothing approximation, ensuring global convergence together with local Q-quadratic convergence. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates for semilinear problems, while showing higher-than-predicted orders for quasilinear ones. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed solver are further demonstrated in comparison with existing methods.

Result: Establishes best approximation error estimates for this generalized setting, proving theoretical bounds for approximation quality despite fractal geometry.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends approximation error analysis to domains and meshes with fractal boundaries, providing theoretical foundations for numerical methods in geometrically complex settings.

Abstract: We prove best approximation error estimates for discontinuous piecewise polynomial approximation in fractional Sobolev spaces on non-Lipschitz meshes of non-Lipschitz domains. In particular, the boundary of the domain, and the boundaries of the mesh elements, can be fractal.

### [10] [Low-rank cross approximation of function-valued tensors for reduced-order modeling of parametric PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22650)
*Stanislav Budzinskiy,Vladimir Kazeev,Maxim Olshanskii*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Develops Tucker decomposition and cross-approximation for function-valued tensors, applies to parametric PDE model reduction via encoder-decoder scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient model order reduction for parametric PDEs where solution maps are function-valued tensors, requiring non-intrusive approximation methods.

Method: Extends Tucker rank, HOSVD, and Tucker-cross decomposition to function-valued tensors in Hilbert spaces, develops adaptive cross-approximation algorithm for low-rank approximations.

Result: Creates reduced-order models as encoder-decoder schemes (nonlinear encoder, multilinear decoder), demonstrates effectiveness on two nonlinear parametric PDE systems.

Conclusion: Geometric inner-product structure suffices for tensor decompositions of function-valued arrays, enabling efficient non-intrusive model reduction for parametric PDEs.

Abstract: The paper considers function-valued tensors, viewed as multidimensional arrays with entries in an abstract Hilbert space. Despite the absence of the algebraic structure of a field, the geometric inner-product structure suffices to introduce the Tucker rank, higher-order SVD, and Tucker-cross decomposition for function-valued tensors. An adaptive cross-approximation algorithm is developed to compute low-rank approximations of such tensors. The framework is motivated by, and applied to, model order reduction of the parameter-to-solution map for a parametric PDE. The resulting reduced-order model can be interpreted as an encoder-decoder scheme with a nonlinear encoder and a multilinear decoder. The performance of the proposed non-intrusive approximation method is demonstrated in numerical examples for two nonlinear parametric PDE systems.

### [11] [A High-Order Localized Orthogonal Decomposition Method for Heterogeneous Stokes Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22684)
*Moritz Hauck,Alexei Lozinski*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: High-order multiscale method for heterogeneous Stokes problems using Localized Orthogonal Decomposition with improved localization and pressure reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend previous multiscale method to higher-order accuracy for heterogeneous Stokes problems, addressing challenges from divergence-free constraints and improving practical implementation aspects.

Method: Based on Localized Orthogonal Decomposition methodology with carefully designed "quantities of interest" functionals. Features improved localization strategy, precise pressure reconstruction, and exponential decay of problem-adapted basis functions enabling localized computation.

Result: Proves exponential decay of basis functions, rigorous a priori error analysis shows high-order convergence for both velocity and pressure when basis supports grow logarithmically with accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The method achieves optimal high-order convergence under minimal structural assumptions on coefficients, with practical localized implementation justified by exponential decay properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a high-order extension of the multiscale method introduced by the authors in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 63(4) (2025), pp. 1617--1641] for heterogeneous Stokes problems, while also providing several other improvements, including a better localization strategy and a more precise pressure reconstruction. The proposed method is based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition methodology and achieves optimal convergence orders under minimal structural assumptions on the coefficients. A key feature of our approach is the careful design of so-called quantities of interest, defining functionals of the solution whose values the multiscale approximation aims to reproduce exactly. Their selection is particularly delicate in the context of Stokes problems due to potential conflicts arising from the divergence-free constraint. We prove the exponential decay of the problem-adapted basis functions, justifying their localized computation in practical implementations. A rigorous a priori error analysis proves high-order convergence for both velocity and pressure, if the basis supports grow logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.

### [12] [A fifth-order absolutely convergent fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid alternative WENO scheme for steady state of hyperbolic conservation laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22790)
*Liang Li,Jun Zhu,Shanqin Chen,Yong-Tao Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils for hyperbolic conservation laws achieves absolute convergence more easily and is more efficient than third-order TVD Runge-Kutta.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend previous work on absolutely convergent fixed-point fast sweeping WENO methods to design a more efficient fifth-order scheme for steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws.

Method: Develop a fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils, using explicit property to apply AWENO with arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes, and designing a novel hybrid technique combining nonlinear AWENO interpolation with linear scheme.

Result: The method achieves absolute convergence (residue converges to machine zero) more easily than original AWENO with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than third-order TVD Runge-Kutta time-marching approach.

Conclusion: The developed fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils provides an efficient and robust approach for solving steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws with absolute convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the previous work on absolutely convergent fixed-point fast sweeping WENO methods by Li et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 443: 110516, 2021) and design a fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping scheme for solving steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Unlike many other fast sweeping methods, the explicit property of fixed-point fast sweeping methods provides flexibility to apply the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AWENO) scheme with unequal-sized substencils as the local solver, which facilitates the usage of arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes. Furthermore, a novel hybrid technique is designed in the local solver to combine the nonlinear AWENO interpolation with the linear scheme for an additional improvement in efficiency of the high-order fast sweeping iterations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils can achieve absolute convergence (i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine zero / round off errors) more easily than the original AWENO method with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than the popular third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time-marching approach to converge to steady state solutions.

### [13] [A structure-preserving semi-implicit four-split scheme for continuum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23015)
*Michael Dumbser,Andrea Thomann,Maurizio Tavelli,Walter Boscheri*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel four-split semi-implicit scheme for unified continuum mechanics that handles fluids and solids with only material time step restriction, overcoming previous explicit discretization limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous structure-preserving discretizations of the unified hyperbolic continuum mechanics system required severe CFL restrictions based on shear sound speed and heat wave speed due to explicit treatment of thermal impulse and distortion field evolution.

Method: Four-split semi-implicit discretization: 1) convective subsystem (explicit), 2) heat subsystem (implicit), 3) momentum-distortion-thermal impulse subsystem (implicit), 4) pressure subsystem (implicit). This approach maintains curl-free properties and is asymptotically consistent with low Mach number and stiff relaxation limits.

Result: The new scheme achieves only material time step restriction (based on continuum velocity) instead of severe CFL restrictions, maintains exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse, and is benchmarked successfully against classical test cases.

Conclusion: The four-split semi-implicit scheme provides an efficient, structure-preserving discretization for unified continuum mechanics that significantly relaxes time step restrictions while maintaining important mathematical properties.

Abstract: We introduce a novel structure-preserving vertex-staggered semi-implicit four-split discretization of a unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics that is able to describe at the same time fluid and solid materials within the same mathematical model. The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties.

### [14] [Time Extrapolation with Graph Convolutional Autoencoder and Tensor Train Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23037)
*Yuanhong Chen,Federico Pichi,Zhen Gao,Gianluigi Rozza*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Graph autoencoder + tensor train decomposition + Operator Inference for reduced-order modeling of parameterized PDEs on unstructured grids with good extrapolation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph autoencoders handle complex unstructured domains well, but struggle with temporal prediction in extrapolation regimes due to needing both temporal causality and parametric generalizability.

Method: Combine graph convolutional autoencoders with tensor train decomposition to separate parametric, spatial, and temporal components. Use Operator Inference to learn temporal evolution. Enhance with multi-fidelity DeepONet framework where spatial/temporal cores are trunk networks and parametric core is branch network.

Result: Numerical experiments on heat-conduction, advection-diffusion, and vortex-shedding show effective learning of dynamics in extrapolation regime for complex geometries, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches like MeshGraphNets.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of graph autoencoders, tensor decomposition, and operator learning provides a time-consistent reduced-order model that effectively handles extrapolation in parameterized dynamical systems on complex domains.

Abstract: Graph autoencoders have gained attention in nonlinear reduced-order modeling of parameterized partial differential equations defined on unstructured grids. Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.

*Ashley Melvin,J. C. Mandal*

TL;DR: A novel HLLC-type path-conservative scheme is developed for weakly compressible two-phase flow models with capillary effects, achieving high-order accuracy through local solution reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly compressible models for two-phase flows result in non-conservative systems that cannot be handled by standard finite volume methods, creating a need for specialized numerical schemes.

Method: Developed a novel HLLC-type path-conservative scheme for weakly compressible two-phase models, incorporating capillary effects directly into the scheme. Combined first-order path-conservative formulation with local solution reconstruction for high-order spatial accuracy.

Result: The solver was tested on several benchmark two-phase flow problems and demonstrated efficacy in handling weakly compressible two-phase flows with capillary effects.

Conclusion: The proposed path-conservative scheme successfully addresses the limitations of standard finite volume methods for non-conservative weakly compressible two-phase flow systems, providing an effective numerical framework with high-order accuracy.

Abstract: When extended to two-phase flows, weakly compressible models lead to a non-conservative system, which precludes its treatment using standard finite volume techniques. In this paper, a novel HLLC-type path-conservative scheme is formulated for the weakly compressible two-phase model. Furthermore, capillary effects are included in the proposed path-conservative scheme, eliminating the need to discretize surface tension terms separately. The first-order path-conservative formulation is combined with a local solution reconstruction technique to obtain high-order spatial accuracy. The solver is tested on several benchmark two-phase flow problems to demonstrate its efficacy.

### [16] [Moment Approximations to Magnetic Rotating Shallow Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23153)
*Julian Koellermeier,Michael Redle,Manuel Torrilhon*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Extends shallow water moment equations to magnetohydrodynamics, using polynomial expansions to capture vertical profiles of velocities and magnetic fields while maintaining 2D computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The magnetic rotating shallow water (MRSW) model loses vertical information when depth-averaging, limiting predictive power. Need to maintain computational efficiency while capturing vertical structure.

Method: Extend shallow water moment equations to MRSW using arbitrary-order polynomial expansions for vertical profiles of velocities and magnetic fields. Close system via Galerkin projection to get evolution equations for polynomial coefficients.

Result: Numerical experiments up to third-order show moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Higher-order moment systems provide improved accuracy for MRSW models while maintaining computational advantages of 2D framework.

Abstract: Originally introduced to describe a transition region in stars, the magnetic rotating shallow water (MRSW) model is now used in many solar physics and geophysical applications. Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection. Through numerical experiments for MRSW moment systems up to third-order, we demonstrate that these moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency.

*Boris D. Andrews,Patrick E. Farrell*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel arbitrary-order time discretization methods that preserve conservation laws and dissipation properties for ODEs/PDEs using auxiliary variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDEs describing isolated systems have conserved quantities (mass, momentum, energy) and dissipated quantities (entropy). Preserving these structural properties in numerical discretizations yields significantly better approximations with the same computational effort compared to non-structure-preserving schemes.

Method: Two novel contributions: (1) arbitrary-order time discretization for conservative ODEs that conserves all known invariants, and (2) energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for ODEs/PDEs in GENERIC format (superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems). Both use systematic introduction of auxiliary variables to replicate conservation/dissipation proofs at discrete level.

Result: The methods are demonstrated with numerical examples including the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, a combustion engine model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation, showing advantages of the structure-preserving approximations.

Conclusion: Systematic use of auxiliary variables enables construction of arbitrary-order time discretizations that preserve conservation and dissipation laws, providing significantly better numerical approximations for thermodynamically isolated systems with the same computational effort.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) describing thermodynamically isolated systems typically possess conserved quantities (like mass, momentum, and energy) and dissipated quantities (like entropy). Preserving these conservation and dissipation laws on discretisation in time can yield vastly better approximations for the same computational effort, compared to schemes that are not structure-preserving. In this work we present two novel contributions: (i) an arbitrary-order time discretisation for general conservative ordinary differential equations that conserves all known invariants and (ii) an energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for both ordinary and partial differential equations written in the GENERIC format, a superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems. In both cases the underlying strategy is the same: the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables, allowing for the replication at the discrete level of the proofs of conservation or dissipation. We illustrate the advantages of our approximations with numerical examples of the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, a combustion engine model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation.

*Naseem Abbas,Vittorio Colao,Davide Macri,William Spataro*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Dual-network PINN framework separates domain and boundary solutions with annealed distance-weighted priors and two-phase training to handle multi-scale PDEs with sharp gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with multi-scale PDEs featuring sharp gradients and complex boundary conditions due to competition between physics residual and boundary enforcement during optimization.

Method: Decompose solution into domain network (u_D) for interior dynamics and boundary network (u_B) for near-boundary corrections, using distance-weighted priors (w_bd = exp(-d/τ)) that are cosine-annealed. Two-phase training: Phase 1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles; Phase 2 employs focused sampling near boundaries with annealed role weights.

Result: On Laplace and Poisson benchmarks, reduces error by 36-90%, improves boundary satisfaction by 21-88%, and decreases MAE by 2.2-9.3× relative to single-network PINNs.

Conclusion: The dual-network framework with annealed specialization and two-phase curriculum effectively handles PDEs with sharp solutions and complex boundary data, adding minimal computational overhead while being simple to implement.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often struggle with multi-scale PDEs featuring sharp gradients and nontrivial boundary conditions, as the physics residual and boundary enforcement compete during optimization. We present a dual-network framework that decomposes the solution as $u = u_{\text{D}} + u_{\text{B}}$, where $u_{\text{D}}$ (domain network) captures interior dynamics and $u_{\text{B}}$ (boundary network) handles near-boundary corrections. Both networks share a unified physics residual while being softly specialized via distance-weighted priors ($w_{\text{bd}} = \exp(-d/τ)$) that are cosine-annealed during training. Boundary conditions are enforced through an augmented Lagrangian method, eliminating manual penalty tuning. Training proceeds in two phases: Phase~1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles and stabilize boundary satisfaction; Phase~2 employs focused sampling (e.g. ring sampling near $\partialΩ$) with annealed role weights to efficiently resolve localized features. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the 1D Fokker-Planck equation, the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, and the 1D wave equation. Across Laplace and Poisson benchmarks, our method reduces error by $36-90\%$, improves boundary satisfaction by $21-88\%$, and decreases MAE by $2.2-9.3\times$ relative to a single-network PINN. Ablations isolate contributions of (i)~soft boundary-interior specialization, (ii)~annealed role regularization, and (iii)~the two-phase curriculum. The method is simple to implement, adds minimal computational overhead, and broadly applies to PDEs with sharp solutions and complex boundary data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RM B-splines have desirable properties (local linear independence, fast evaluation) for isogeometric analysis, but their relationship to existing refinement frameworks needs clarification to enable automatic mesh refinement.

Method: The paper demonstrates that Reachable Minimally supported (RM) B-splines can be viewed as a special case of Locally Refined (LR) B-splines, allowing existing LR B-spline refinement procedures to be applied to RM B-splines.

Conclusion: The connection between RM B-splines and LR B-splines provides a straightforward way to implement automatic mesh refinement for RM B-splines, enhancing their utility in isogeometric analysis applications.

Abstract: Reachable Minimally supported (RM) B-splines have been recently introduced as a novel B-spline--like basis. They feature local linear independence and admit a fast de Boor--like evaluation algorithm. These properties make them particularly attractive for applications in isogeometric analysis. In this note, we show that automatic mesh refinement procedures can be readily established by observing that RM B-splines are a special case of Locally Refined (LR) B-splines.

Motivation: To study the asymptotic behavior of magnetoelastic energy functionals with mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian structure, addressing the gap in homogenization results for manifold-valued mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian energies.

Method: Simultaneous homogenization and linearization analysis using Gamma-convergence framework for magnetoelastic energy functional with nonlinear magnetoelastic energy, symmetric exchange term on actual configuration, and magnetostatic self-energy.

Result: Established compactness of displacements and magnetizations with equibounded energy, identified limiting energy functional as sum of quadratic homogenized magnetoelastic contribution with homogenized exchange and magnetostatic terms.

Conclusion: First homogenization result for manifold-valued mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian energies, providing mathematical foundation for asymptotic analysis of complex magnetoelastic systems.

Abstract: We perform a simultaneous homogenization and linearization analysis for a magnetoelastic energy functional featuring a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian structure. Neglecting Zeeman and anisotropic contributions, we characterize the asymptotic behavior in the sense of Gamma-convergence for the sum of a nonlinear magnetoelastic energy, a symmetric exchange term defined on the actual configuration, and for the associated magnetostatic self-energy. After establishing compactness of displacements and magnetizations with equibounded energy, we identify the limiting energy functional as the sum of a quadratic homogenized magnetoelastic contribution with a limiting homogenized exchange and magnetostatic term. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first homogenization result for manifold-valued mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian energies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations with coupled cubic nonlinearities in the large N limit, connecting microscopic dynamics to macroscopic mean-field descriptions.

Method: Study the hyperbolic O(N) linear sigma model (HLSM_N) on 2D torus, establish global well-posedness for both HLSM_N and mean-field SdNLW, then prove convergence with rates using analytical techniques for stochastic PDEs.

Result: Proved convergence of HLSM_N to mean-field SdNLW with general initial data, obtaining convergence rate N^{-1/2+ε} for local-in-time convergence, and same rate for invariant Gibbs dynamics convergence on large time intervals.

Conclusion: The hyperbolic O(N) linear sigma model converges to its mean-field limit with explicit convergence rates, providing rigorous connection between microscopic interacting systems and macroscopic mean-field descriptions in stochastic wave equations.

Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ for any $ \varepsilon > 0$. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$) converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12 + \varepsilon}$ on any large time intervals.

### [22] [Sharp non-uniqueness for the Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22023)
*Zipeng Chen,Zhaoyang Yin*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves non-uniqueness of weak solutions for the d-dimensional Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation, showing uniqueness breaks down in specific function spaces when α is in certain ranges, while constructing solutions that are smooth except on a small singular set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the well-posedness and uniqueness properties of the Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation, particularly understanding when uniqueness fails and constructing explicit counterexamples to uniqueness in critical function spaces.

Method: The authors construct explicit weak solutions that demonstrate non-uniqueness, showing these solutions belong to specific function spaces (L^p_tL^∞_x and L^{2α/(2α-1)}_tL^q_x) and are smooth outside a set of singular times with arbitrarily small Hausdorff dimension.

Result: Uniqueness breaks down in L^p_tL^∞_x for p < 2α/(2α-1) when 1 ≤ α < (d+1)/2, and in L^{2α/(2α-1)}_tL^q_x for any q < ∞ when 1 < α < (d+1)/2. The constructed weak solutions are smooth outside a small singular set, and the result is sharp since weak-strong uniqueness holds in L^{2α/(2α-1)}_TL^∞_x.

Conclusion: The paper establishes sharp non-uniqueness results for the Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation, precisely characterizing the function spaces where uniqueness fails and demonstrating the optimality of these results through weak-strong uniqueness in a slightly stronger space.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the $d$-dimensional ($d\geq2$) Boussinesq equation with fractional dissipation $(-Δ)^α$ on the torus. We show that the uniqueness property breaks down within the function space $L^p_tL^\infty_x$ for any $p<\frac{2α}{2α-1}$ when $1\leqα<\frac{d+1}{2}$ and the function space $L^\frac{2α}{2α-1}_tL^q_x$ for any $q<\infty$ when $1<α<\frac{d+1}{2}$. Moreover, the weak solutions we construct are smooth outside a set of singular times with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily small. This result is sharp, as weak-strong uniqueness holds in the space $L^{\frac{2α}{2α-1}}_TL^\infty_x$.

TL;DR: Rigorous justification of joint low-Mach/low-Froude limit for compressible Navier-Stokes with degenerate viscosity, converging to generalized anelastic system, without needing cold pressure regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish singular limit results for compressible Navier-Stokes with degenerate viscosity without requiring additional regularization, addressing limitations of previous approaches that relied on cold pressure terms.

Method: Uses relative entropy framework based on κ-entropy concept. For well-prepared data in periodic domains, employs standard techniques. For ill-prepared data in whole space, relies on dispersive estimates for acoustic waves.

Result: Proves convergence of weak solutions to generalized anelastic system in both settings: well-prepared data in 3D periodic domains and ill-prepared data in whole space, without needing cold pressure regularization.

Conclusion: First rigorous singular limit result for compressible Navier-Stokes with degenerate viscosity that requires no additional system regularization, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the joint low-Mach and low-Frode number limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate, density-dependent viscosity. Employing the relative entropy framework based on the concept of $κ$-entropy, we rigorously justify the convergence of weak solutions toward the generalized anelastic system in a three-dimensional periodic domain for well-prepared initial data. For general ill-prepared initial data, we establish a similar convergence result in the whole space, relying essentially on dispersive estimates for acoustic waves. Compared with the work of Fanelli and Zatorska [Commun. Math. Phys., 400 (2023), pp. 1463-1506], our analysis is conducted for the standard isentropic pressure law, thereby eliminating the need for the cold pressure term that played a crucial role in the previous approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous singular limit result for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity that requires no additional regularization of the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the finite deformation of thin, elastically heterogeneous sheets coupled with electrostatics, and to derive reduced-dimensional models that capture both mechanical and electrical interactions.

Method: Applied Γ-convergence-type methods to a 3D electro-elastic saddle-point problem with prestrain, using adapted epi/hypo-convergence for bivariate functionals to perform dimension reduction from 3D to 2D.

Result: Successfully derived an effective two-dimensional bending model coupled to electric effects, and proved that cluster points of saddle points converge to saddle points of the limit problem.

Conclusion: The rigorous dimension reduction approach provides a mathematically sound framework for modeling thin electro-elastic sheets, establishing convergence properties that validate the derived 2D plate model.

Abstract: We study the finite deformation of a thin, elastically heterogeneous sheet subject to electrostatic coupling. The interaction between mechanics and electrostatics is formulated as a saddle-point problem involving the deformation and the electrostatic potential. Starting from a three-dimensional electro-elastic model with prestrain in the elastic energy, we rigorously derive a reduced plate model in the bending regime. To perform the dimension reduction, that is, to derive the energy of a thin object by taking a suitable limit as its thickness tends to zero, we apply $Γ$-convergence-type methods to the underlying saddle-point problem. In the case of bivariate functionals, this convergence is understood in an adapted epi/hypo-convergence sense. In this concept, we demonstrate the convergence of the rescaled electro-elastic problems to an effective two-dimensional bending model coupled to electric effects. We verify that cluster points of saddle points are saddle points for the limit.

TL;DR: A 3D solver for stellar oscillations using Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method to model wave propagation through solar heterogeneities like active regions and convection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With improved solar observations, there's a need to account for 3D heterogeneities in wave modeling for accurate seismic data interpretation, moving beyond simplified 1D or 2D approaches.

Method: Developed a 3D solver using Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows. Uses first-order formulation in terms of vector displacement and pressure perturbation, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint.

Result: The solver successfully handles wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of active regions and convection, showing importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations when perturbation amplitudes are strong and cannot be estimated by linear approximations.

Conclusion: The 3D HDG-based solver enables accurate modeling of wave propagation through solar heterogeneities, providing essential capabilities for interpreting modern solar seismic data and understanding complex solar phenomena.

Abstract: With increasing quantity and quality of solar observations, it becomes essential to account for three-dimensional heterogeneities in wave modeling for seismic data interpretation. In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.

Motivation: To understand regularity properties of solutions to Stokes systems under generalized growth conditions (Orlicz-type), which extend beyond classical Sobolev spaces and allow for more flexible nonlinear behavior in differential operators.

Method: Uses Orlicz spaces and Besov spaces to analyze fractional regularity. Proves a new Poincaré-Sobolev inequality in Orlicz spaces (in modular form) on domains with finite measure. Establishes regularity via membership of nonlinear expressions of symmetric gradients in Besov spaces.

Result: Establishes fractional regularity properties for symmetric gradients of local solutions to Stokes systems, showing dependence on balance between operator nonlinearity and right-hand side integrability. Also obtains fractional regularity for pressure terms in Orlicz-Besov spaces. Provides parallel results for associated elliptic systems.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends regularity theory to Stokes systems with Orlicz-type growth, providing a framework that connects operator nonlinearity with solution regularity through Orlicz and Besov space analysis, with applications to both Stokes and elliptic systems.

Abstract: This work concerns the stationary Stokes system subject to Orlicz type growth conditions. Fractional regularity properties of the symmetric gradient of local solutions are established, depending on a balance between the nonlinearity of the differential operator and the degree of integrability of the right-hand side in Orlicz spaces. This regularity is described via the membership of a non linear expression of the symmetric gradient in Besov spaces. The fractional regularity of the pressure term is also exhibited and is formulated in terms of Orlicz-Besov spaces. Parallel results for the symmetric gradient of local solutions to the associated plain elliptic system are also offered. A new version of a Poincaré-Sobolev inequality in Orlicz spaces, in modular form, on domains with finite measure plays a role in the proofs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study existence and multiplicity of solutions for Robin boundary value problems with sign-changing nonlinearities, and understand how the solution set transitions between Neumann and Dirichlet cases as the boundary parameter varies.

Method: Analysis of the Robin problem using variational methods and bifurcation theory, examining the limiting behavior as γ→0 (Neumann limit) and γ→∞ (Dirichlet limit).

Result: Established existence of two nonnegative solutions with maxima in (α,β) for sufficiently large λ, and showed solution set degenerates to Neumann problem as γ→0 and to Dirichlet problem as γ→∞.

Conclusion: The Robin problem exhibits rich solution structure with multiplicity results, and serves as a bridge connecting Neumann and Dirichlet boundary value problems through parameter variation.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the Robin problem \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -Δu = λf(u) & \text{in } Ω,
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial ν} + γu=0 & \text{on } \partialΩ,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 1$) is a smooth bounded domain, and $λ, γ>0$. Our main assumption is that $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a locally Lipschitz function, possibly sign-changing, such that $f(s)>0$ for every $s\in (α,β)$, where $0<α<β$ are two zeros of $f$. Without any further conditions, we establish the existence of two nonnegative solutions whose maximum lies in $(α,β)$ for sufficiently large $λ$.
  Moreover, we analyse the limiting behaviour of the solution set of this Robin problem, showing that it degenerates into that of the associated Neumann problem as $γ\to 0$ and into that of the associated Dirichlet problem as $γ\to\infty$.

Motivation: To understand when differential operators on non-compact manifolds have closed range, extending previous compact manifold results to more general geometric settings.

Method: Analyzes first-order differential operators on M×𝕋^m where M is non-compact with suitable geometric assumptions, using involutive structure theory and weaker global hypoellipticity notions.

Result: Establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for closed range of these operators, and proves that weaker global hypoellipticity ensures closed range on smooth paracompact manifolds.

Conclusion: Successfully extends Araújo, Ferra, and Ragognette's compact manifold results to non-compact settings, providing complete characterization of closed range properties for this class of differential operators.

Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the closedness of the range of a class of first-order differential operators associated with an involutive structure on $M\times\mathbb{T}^m$, where $M$ is a non-compact manifold satisfying suitable geometric assumptions and $\mathbb{T}^m$ is the $m$-dimensional torus. In addition, we prove that a weaker notion of global hypoellipticity ensures the closedness of the range for differential operators on smooth paracompact manifolds, thereby extending to the non-compact setting a result previously obtained by G.~Araújo, I.~Ferra, and L.~Ragognette [J.

*Mario Bukal,Igor Kukavica,Linfeng Li,Boris Muha*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Global existence of weak solutions for 3D fluid-structure interaction system with viscous fluid and elastic plate boundary, preventing contact between plate and bottom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish existence of global-in-time solutions for coupled fluid-structure systems where an elastic plate forms the moving upper boundary of a viscous fluid, addressing the mathematical challenge of proving solution existence without physical contact between boundaries.

Method: Analysis of 3D Navier-Stokes equations for viscous incompressible fluid coupled with elastic plate equations via velocity- and stress-matching conditions at the moving boundary interface.

Result: Proves existence of global-in-time weak solutions under general initial conditions, with the important property that the plate never contacts the bottom boundary.

Conclusion: The fluid-structure interaction system with elastic plate boundary admits global weak solutions that maintain physical separation between boundaries, providing mathematical foundation for such coupled systems.

Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction system modeling a system consisting of a viscous incompressible fluid and an elastic plate forming its moving upper boundary. The fluid is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free upper boundary that evolves according to the motion of the structure, coupled via the velocity- and stress-matching conditions. We show that under a rather general condition on the initial data, there exists a global-in-time weak solution of the system. In particular, there is no contact between the plate and the bottom boundary.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between finite-dimensional random matrix control problems and their infinite-dimensional free-probability counterparts, establishing rigorous connections between these two frameworks.

Conclusion: Establishes rigorous connection between finite random matrix control and free-probability analogues, offering new insights into large deviation theory for random matrices through control-theoretic perspective.

Abstract: Building on the free-probability stochastic control framework introduced in arXiv:2502.17329, we connect optimal control problems for $n \times n$ random matrix ensembles with their infinite-dimensional, free-probability analogues. Under natural convexity hypotheses, we prove that the non-commutative value function captures the large-$n$ limit of the corresponding finite-matrix control problems. As an application, we give a new perspective on the Laplace principle for convex functionals in the theory of large deviations for random matrices.

*Yongji Wang,Tristan Léger,Ching-Yao Lai,Tristan Buckmaster*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme combined with multi-stage neural networks achieves machine precision for highly unstable self-similar singularities in fluid dynamics equations, enabling discovery of new unstable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous computational frameworks could only achieve high accuracy for stable and mildly unstable solutions, but failed for highly unstable solutions with extreme gradients due to large localized PDE residuals that hindered convergence and obscured critical scaling parameter signals.

Method: Introduces a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme that addresses high-gradient challenges while amplifying residual signals at the origin for scaling parameter identification, coupled with multi-stage neural network architecture.

Result: PDE residuals reduced to round-off error level across wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities; enables discovery of new highly unstable solutions including 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and novel family of highly unstable solitons for Nonlinear Schrödinger equations.

Conclusion: The method achieves high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing a crucial ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the long-time dynamics of radial solutions to the focusing energy-critical wave equation in 5D, particularly the asymptotic behavior and soliton resolution conjecture in the radial case without requiring a priori boundedness of energy norms.

Method: The main method uses radiation theory of wave equations and establishes a correspondence between radiation and soliton collision behavior of solutions. The approach focuses on analyzing non-radiative solutions and their topological structure and time evolution.

Result: The paper proves a quantitative version of the soliton resolution theorem for solutions defined for all time t>0, which immediately verifies the soliton resolution conjecture in the radial case without requiring a priori boundedness assumption on the energy norm as time tends to infinity.

Conclusion: The work establishes a fundamental connection between radiation and soliton collision behavior, providing a complete resolution of the soliton resolution conjecture for radial solutions to the focusing energy-critical wave equation in 5D, with applications to understanding long-time dynamics.

Abstract: In this article we discuss the long-time dynamics of the radial solutions to the focusing energy-critical wave equation in 5-dimensional space. We give some details about the asymptotic behaviour, topological structure and time evolution of the non-radiative solutions to this equation. As an application we prove a quantitative version of soliton resolution theorem for solutions defined for all time $t>0$, which immediately verifies the soliton resolution conjecture in the radial case, without a priori boundedness assumption on the energy norm of solution as time tends to infinity. The main tool of this work is the radiation theory of wave equations and the major observation of this work is a correspondence between the radiation and the soliton collision behaviour of solutions.

### [37] [Results of Fractional Rough Burgers equation in $H^s$ space and its application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22900)
*Shuolin Zhang,Zhaonan Luo,Zhaoyang Yin*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies well-posedness of Fractional Rough Burgers equation with space-time noise in Sobolev spaces, establishing local well-posedness for higher dissipation (γ∈(4/3,2]) and global well-posedness for γ∈(3/2,2], while using para-controlled solutions for lower dissipation (γ∈(5/4,4/3]).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the well-posedness properties of the Fractional Rough Burgers equation driven by space-time noise in Sobolev spaces, addressing both local and global existence/uniqueness for different dissipation parameter ranges.

Method: The authors use functional analysis techniques in Sobolev spaces H^s(T) for the higher dissipation regime, and employ para-controlled solution methods via regularity analysis for the lower dissipation regime.

Result: Local well-posedness established for γ∈(4/3,2]; global well-posedness obtained for γ∈(3/2,2]; and para-controlled solutions derived for γ∈(5/4,4/3] using regularity analysis.

Conclusion: The Fractional Rough Burgers equation exhibits different well-posedness regimes depending on the dissipation parameter γ, with stronger results (global well-posedness) for higher dissipation values and more technical para-controlled solutions needed for lower dissipation values.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of Fractional Rough Burgers equation driven by space-time noise in $H^s(\m T)$ space. For the higher dissipation $γ\in(\frac{4}{3},2]$, we establish local well-posedness. Global well-posedness is further obtained when $γ$ is restricted to the interval $(\frac{3}{2}, 2]$. For the lower dissipation $γ\in(\frac{5}{4},\frac{4}{3}]$, we use the regularity analysis derivation the para-controlled solution.

*Tau Shean Lim,Shuoning Zhang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Establishes entropic propagation of chaos for mixed mean-field jump processes with explicit bounds on relative entropy between N-particle system and mean-field limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study mixed mean-field jump processes on abstract state spaces, particularly piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) with mean-field interactions, and understand their convergence properties as particle number increases.

Method: Analyzes mixed mean-field jump processes consisting of independent Markovian component plus bounded mean-field jump interaction. Uses second-order bounded difference condition on mean-field jump kernel and applies second-order concentration inequality from Götze and Sambale (2020).

Result: Establishes entropic propagation of chaos as N→∞ with explicit qualitative bound on relative entropy between law of N-particle system and product measure induced by mean-field limit.

Conclusion: The framework successfully covers PDMPs with mean-field interactions and provides rigorous convergence results with quantitative bounds using advanced concentration inequalities.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of mixed mean-field jump processes on an abstract state space $Π$, together with their associated $N$-particle systems. The dynamics consist of the superposition of an independent Markovian component and a bounded mean-field jump interaction; in particular, piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) with mean-field interactions are covered by this framework. Under a second-order bounded difference condition on the mean-field jump kernel, we establish entropic propagation of chaos as $N \to \infty$. In particular, we obtain an explicit qualitative bound on the relative entropy between the law of the $N$-particle system and the product measure induced by the mean-field limit. The proof relies on the second-order concentration inequality introduced in Götze and Sambale, 2020.

*Massimo Sorella,David Villringer*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Constructed a velocity field on 3D torus that produces exponential magnetic energy growth along subsequences for all positive magnetic diffusivities, proving weak form of fast dynamo conjecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fast dynamo conjecture in magnetohydrodynamics, which asks whether magnetic fields can grow exponentially fast in the limit of zero magnetic diffusivity. The authors aim to prove the weak form of this conjecture on the 3D torus.

Method: Constructed time-dependent, incompressible, uniformly Lipschitz continuous velocity field using suitably rescaled Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows supported on long time intervals. Employed perturbation theory to analyze continuity of exponential growth rate with respect to initial data and diffusivity parameter.

Result: Successfully constructed velocity field that produces exponential growth of magnetic energy along a subsequence of times for every positive magnetic diffusivity (limsup fast dynamo). This proves the weak form of the fast dynamo conjecture formulated by Childress and Gilbert on the 3D torus.

Conclusion: The weak form of the fast dynamo conjecture is proven on the 3D torus, but the stronger version proposed by Arnold remains an open problem. The construction demonstrates that exponential magnetic energy growth can occur along subsequences for all positive diffusivities.

Abstract: We construct a time-dependent, incompressible, and uniformly-in-time Lipschitz continuous velocity field on $\mathbb{T}^3$ that produces exponential growth of the magnetic energy along a subsequence of times, for every positive value of the magnetic diffusivity. Because this growth is not uniform in time but occurs only along a diverging sequence of times, we refer to the resulting mechanism as a limsup fast dynamo. Our construction is based on suitably rescaled Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows, each supported on long time intervals. The analysis employs perturbation theory to establish continuity of the exponential growth rate with respect to both the initial data and the diffusivity parameter. This proves the weak form of the fast dynamo conjecture formulated by Childress and Gilbert on $\mathbb{T}^3$, but the considerably more challenging version proposed by Arnold on $\mathbb{T}^3$ remains an open problem.

*Vladimir I. Bogachev,Michael Röckner,Stanislav V. Shaposhnikov*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence of probability solutions for nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations on infinite-dimensional spaces with Gaussian measure, including drifts depending on the solution itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish existence results for nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations in infinite dimensions, where the drift coefficient depends on the unknown solution, which is relevant for applications like Vlasov-type drifts in statistical physics.

Method: Prove existence using centered Gaussian measure γ with unit diffusion operator and drift of form -x+v(p,x), where v is bounded mapping to Cameron-Martin space H, with v defined on probability density space E×X. Consider two cases: (1) v bounded with continuity condition, (2) components uniformly bounded with stronger continuity.

Result: Prove existence of probability solutions for both cases: with bounded v satisfying continuity condition, and with uniformly bounded components under stronger continuity. Apply to Vlasov-type drifts defined by convolution with solution.

Conclusion: Established existence theorems for nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations in infinite dimensions with solution-dependent drifts, covering both bounded and component-bounded cases with appropriate continuity conditions.

Abstract: We prove existence of a probability solution to the nonlinear stationary Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation on an infinite dimensional space with a centered Gaussian measure $γ$ with a unit diffusion operator and a drift of the form $-x+v(p,x)$, where $v$ is a bounded mapping with values in the Cameron-Martin space $H$ of $γ$ and $v$ is defined on the space $E\times X$, where is $E$ is the subset of $L^2(γ)$ consisting of probability densities. The equation has the form $L_{b(p,\bullet)} ^*(p\cdot γ)=0$ with $L_{b(p,\bullet)}\varphi =Δ_H \varphi + (b(p,\bullet) , D_{_H}\varphi)_{_H}$, so that the drift coefficient depends on the unknown solution, which makes the equation nonlinear. This dependence is assumed to satisfy a suitable continuity condition. This result is applied to drifts of Vlasov type defined by means of the convolution of a vector field with the solution. In addition, we consider a more general situation where only the components of $v$ are uniformly bounded and prove the existence of a probability solution under some stronger continuity condition on the drift.

*Samuel Mercer,Yves van Gennip*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Extends Brezis-Pazy theorem to nonlinear semigroups acting on different Banach spaces via "Banach stacking" framework, with applications to gradient flow convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 1972 Brezis-Pazy theorem only applies to semigroups on a single Banach space. The authors want to extend this to semigroups acting on different Banach spaces, which is needed for applications like discrete-to-continuum convergence of graph-based gradient flows.

Method: Introduces "Banach stacking" framework that allows nonlinear semigroups to act on different Banach spaces. Extends the Brezis-Pazy theorem to this setting. Provides three main applications: 1) uniform convergence when generators converge pointwise, 2) gradient flows of Γ-converging λ-convex functions on Hilbert spaces, 3) gradient flows of Γ-converging P₀-convex functions on L^p spaces (TL^p spaces).

Result: Successfully extends the Brezis-Pazy theorem to the Banach stacking setting. Provides three convergence results: 1) uniform semigroup convergence from pointwise generator convergence, 2) uniform convergence for gradient flows of Γ-converging λ-convex functions, 3) uniform convergence for gradient flows of Γ-converging P₀-convex functions on TL^p spaces.

Conclusion: The Banach stacking framework successfully generalizes the Brezis-Pazy theorem to semigroups on different Banach spaces, enabling applications to discrete-to-continuum convergence problems in gradient flow theory, particularly for graph-based problems and TL^p spaces.

Abstract: A 1972 theorem by Brezis and Pazy establishes the uniform convergence of nonlinear semigroups generated by $ω$-accretive operators on a Banach space. Our goal is to expand the setting of this theorem to include nonlinear semigroups that are acting on different Banach spaces. This is useful, for example, to prove discrete-to-continuum convergence for graph-based gradient flows. We name the general setting in which our theorem holds a Banach stacking.
  We give three main applications of the extended theorem that are of independent interest. The first establishes uniform convergence of semigroups in a Banach stacking if the generators of the semigroups converge pointwise. The second is a proof of uniform convergence for gradient flows of $Γ$-converging $λ$-convex functions on a Banach stacking of Hilbert spaces; the third a proof of uniform convergence for gradient flows of $Γ$-converging functions that satisfy a convexity condition that was formulated by Bénilan and Crandall in a 1991 publication (and which we term `$P_0$-convexity') on a Banach stacking of $L^p$ spaces, corresponding to the $TL^p$ space introduced by García Trillos and Slepčev in a 2016 paper.

Abstract: We consider a stationary drift-diffusion system with ionic charge carriers and external generation of electron and hole charge carriers. This system arises, among other applications, in the context of semiconductor modeling for perovskite solar cells. Thanks to truncation techniques and iterative energy estimates, we show the existence and uniform upper and lower bounds on the solutions. The dependency of the bounds on the various parameters of the model is investigated numerically on physically relevant test cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of the HED Method for Mullins-Sekerka evolution by identifying a more natural, intrinsic distance metric for the interface and establishing sharper convergence results beyond just the rate.

Method: Revisits the HED Method, identifies a natural notion of distance intrinsic to the interface itself, uses this distance along with energy and dissipation to develop natural assumptions on the flow, and analyzes convergence properties assuming existence of solutions satisfying these conditions.

Result: Establishes not just the algebraic convergence rate (previously known from Chugreeva, Otto, and Westdickenberg), but also the sharp leading order constant for convergence to the flat limiting interface.

Conclusion: The paper provides a refined analysis of Mullins-Sekerka evolution using an intrinsic interface distance, yielding sharper convergence results including the leading constant, advancing beyond previous work that only established the convergence rate.

Abstract: We revisit the HED Method for the Mullins-Sekerka evolution in the plane. We identify a natural notion of distance, intrinsic to the interface itself. Using this distance, the energy, and the dissipation, we develop natural assumptions on the flow and, assuming existence of a solution satisfying these conditions, establish not just the algebraic rate (previously derived by Chugreeva, Otto, and M.

Motivation: To study the mathematical properties of nonlocal nonlinear logistic equations involving fractional p-Laplacian operators, which model various physical and biological phenomena with nonlocal diffusion effects.

Method: Analytical methods for proving existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the stationary problem, followed by analysis of solution behavior with respect to parameter λ, and study of associated parabolic problems including local/global existence, uniqueness, and long-term behavior.

Result: Proved existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the nonlocal nonlinear logistic equation, analyzed solution behavior with respect to parameter λ, and established results for the parabolic problem including stabilization, finite time extinction, and blow-up phenomena.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive mathematical analysis of nonlocal nonlinear logistic equations, demonstrating how nonlocal operators affect solution behavior and establishing fundamental properties for both stationary and time-dependent problems.

Abstract: In this paper we prove existence, uniqueness of weak solutions of the following nonlocal nonlinear logistic equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} (-Δ)_p^s u_λ=λu_λ^q - b(x)u_λ^r \quad \text{in} \;Ω,\\ u_λ=0 \quad \text{in} \; ( \mathbb{R}^d \backslash Ω), \\ u_λ>0 \text{ in} \; Ω. \end{cases}\ \end{equation*} We also prove behavior of $u_λ$ with respect to $λ,$ underlining the effect of the nonlocal operator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish convergence results for granular media equations in genuinely nonconvex settings where traditional convexity assumptions don't hold, particularly for applications like chemotaxis models.

Method: Uses Wasserstein-Łojasiewicz gradient inequality for free energy under mild analyticity assumptions on potentials, enabling analysis of Wasserstein gradient flows without convexity requirements or log-Sobolev inequalities.

Result: Proves convergence to equilibrium for solutions to McKean-Vlasov equation on flat torus in nonconvex settings, with Keller-Segel chemotaxis model as key application.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein-Łojasiewicz gradient inequality approach provides a powerful framework for analyzing nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows, extending beyond traditional convexity-based methods.

Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for solutions to the McKean-Vlasov (granular media) equation on the flat torus in a genuinely nonconvex setting. Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-Łojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials; this yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without any convexity assumptions and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows; in the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a key application.

### [46] [Convergence and front position for an FKPP-type free boundary problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23457)
*Julien Berestycki,Sarah Penington,Oliver Tough*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a free boundary problem related to branching-selection particle systems, showing convergence to minimal traveling waves and establishing precise asymptotics for front positions, extending Bramson's FKPP results to more general regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The free boundary problem appears as the hydrodynamic limit of the N-BBM branching-selection particle system and has been conjectured to belong to the FKPP universality class. The motivation is to rigorously establish convergence to traveling wave solutions and precise front position asymptotics, extending classical FKPP results to more general regimes including pulled, pushed, and pushmi-pullyu behaviors.

Method: The authors study solutions to the free boundary problem with fast-decaying initial conditions. They analyze convergence to minimal traveling wave solutions and derive precise asymptotics for the free boundary position L_t. The approach involves establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence and extending the analysis to a parameter-dependent generalization that exhibits transitions between different dynamical regimes.

Result: For fast-decaying initial conditions, the solution converges to the minimal traveling wave. The free boundary position has Bramson asymptotics: L_t = √2 t - (3/(2√2)) log t + c + o(1) as t→∞. The authors establish necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence and precise front asymptotics across pulled, pushed, and pushmi-pullyu regimes in a generalized parameter-dependent problem.

Conclusion: The work rigorously proves convergence to minimal traveling waves and establishes precise Bramson-type asymptotics for free boundary problems, extending classical FKPP results. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence across different dynamical regimes (pulled, pushed, pushmi-pullyu), confirming and extending physics predictions by the authors and collaborators.

Abstract: The free boundary problem\[ \begin{cases} \partial_tu=\frac{1}{2}Δu+u,\quad &t>0, \, x>L_t,\\ u(t,x)=0,\quad &t>0,\, x\le L_t,\\ \int_{L_t}^{\infty}u(t,y)dy=1,\quad &t> 0,\\ u(t,x)dx \to u_0(dx)&\text{weakly as }t\to 0, \end{cases}\] has long been conjectured to be in the universality class of the so-called FKPP reaction-diffusion equation. It appears naturally as the hydrodynamic limit of a branching-selection particle system, the $N$-BBM. In the present work, we show that for any initial condition $u_0(dx)$ that decays fast enough as $x\to\infty$, the solution of the free boundary problem converges to the minimal travelling wave solution. We further show how the decay of the initial condition precisely determines the position of the free boundary $L_t$ at large times $t$, mirroring the celebrated results of Bramson \cite{Bramson1983} in the context of the FKPP equation. Our conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, and for $L_t$ to have the Bramson asymptotics \[ L_t=\sqrt{2}t-\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}\log t+c+o(1)\quad\text{as }t\to\infty,\] are necessary and sufficient. We also apply our results to a more general free boundary problem that depends on a parameter $β$, where we see a transition from \emph{pulled} to \emph{pushed} behaviour (with \emph{pushmi-pullyu} behaviour at the critical value of $β$). We obtain analogous sharp conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, along with precise asymptotics for the front position, in each of these regimes. To our knowledge, such necessary and sufficient conditions had not previously been established in the pushmi-pullyu or pushed regimes, even for classical monostable reaction-diffusion equations. Our results prove and extend non-rigorous predictions in the physics literature of the first author, Brunet and Derrida.

TL;DR: A new method for solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation using coupled finite/boundary elements with automatic optimal relaxation parameter selection, achieving faster convergence without user intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is crucial for molecular electrostatics but typically solved in linearized form due to challenging sinh nonlinearity, limiting its use in highly charged systems like nucleic acids.

Method: Coupled finite/boundary element scheme with automatic optimal relaxation parameter selection, using Newton-Raphson method with gradual nonlinearity introduction via cubic approximation in first iteration.

Result: Validated against APBS for spherical cavity; Newton-Raphson with cubic approximation reduced iterations by 40%; achieved 1.37x speed-up over best hand-picked relaxation factor for highly charged molecule 1HC8.

Conclusion: The method provides reliable, fast convergence for nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation without trial-and-error parameter tuning, enabling better modeling of highly charged biomolecular systems.

Abstract: The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is widely used to model molecular electrostatics; however, it is usually solved in linearised form because the sinh nonlinearity is challenging, limiting its applicability in highly charged systems such as nucleic acids. This work presents a solution method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a coupled finite/boundary element scheme that automatically finds an optimal relaxation parameter, ensuring fast and reliable convergence of the nonlinear solver without user intervention. We validated our solver against APBS for a spherical cavity, and used RNA-based structures to perform a thorough study of the different algorithmic choices, and to test our implementation. We found that the best alternative to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was using a Newton-Raphson method where the nonlinearity was gradually introduced with a cubic approximation in the first iteration. Newton-Raphson was also the best method to find the optimal relaxation factor, reducing the number of iterations by 40%. Including other optimisation techniques, we were able to obtain a 1.37x speed-up with respect to the best hand-picked relaxation factor for 1HC8 (molecule with highest charge in our tests), avoiding any trial-and-error process to find the relaxation factor.

TL;DR: Proposed SPI-DNIO framework combines DD-Net and DIP-Net for faster, higher-quality single-pixel imaging with better generalization, plus gradient-enriched residual blocks for low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-pixel imaging methods have limitations: DIP-Net requires thousands of iterations for high-quality reconstruction, while DD-Net only works well when targets resemble training data. Need a solution that combines strengths of both approaches and handles low sampling rates effectively.

Method: Proposed dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that integrates DD-Net and DIP-Net. Also designed gradient-enriched residual blocks to enhance information flow in deep networks, especially for low sampling rate SPI inputs where effective information is limited.

Result: SPI-DNIO achieves high-quality image reconstruction with fewer iteration steps than DIP-Net alone. The framework demonstrates exceptional reconstruction capabilities and generalization performance in both indoor (active lighting) and outdoor long-range (passive lighting) experiments.

Conclusion: The SPI-DNIO framework successfully addresses limitations of existing SPI methods by combining complementary strengths of DD-Net and DIP-Net, while gradient-enriched residual blocks improve learning capabilities for low sampling rate scenarios, making it effective for diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging(SPI),especially when integrated with deep neural networks like deep image prior networks (DIP-Net) or data-driven networks (DD-Net), has gained considerable attention for its capability to generate high-quality reconstructed images, even in the presence of sub-sampling conditions. However, DIP-Net often requires thousands of iterations to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and DD-Net performs optimally only when the target closely resembles the features present in its training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that combines the strengths of both DD-Net and DIP-Net. It has been demonstrated that this approach can recover high-quality images with fewer iteration steps. Furthermore, to address the challenge of SPI inputs having less effective information at low sampling rates, we have designed a residual block enriched with gradient information, which can convey details to deeper layers, thereby enhancing the deep network's learning capabilities. We have applied these techniques to both indoor experiments with active lighting and outdoor long-range experiments with passive lighting. Our experimental results confirm the exceptional reconstruction capabilities and generalization performance of the SPI-DNIO framework.

TL;DR: A robust indexing algorithm for serial crystallography that handles patterns with few reliable peaks, background contamination, and skewed unit cells by formulating indexing as symmetry-aware lattice decoding with outlier trimming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serial crystallography produces thousands of diffraction patterns from randomly oriented crystals, but indexing is unstable when patterns have few reliable peaks, background contamination, or crystals with highly skewed unit cells.

Method: Formulates indexing as symmetry-aware lattice decoding with a loss that incorporates lattice symmetries while trimming outlier peaks. Uses reciprocal-space basis reparameterization for skewed lattices and a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with orientation recovery from few reflections.

Result: The algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers (XGANDALF and TORO) on three protein datasets from Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and skewed unit cells. It's memory-efficient and suitable for parallelization.

Conclusion: Exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness for serial crystallography, making the method particularly effective for challenging datasets with few reflections or skewed unit cells.

Abstract: Serial crystallography experiments routinely produce thousands of diffraction patterns from crystals in random orientations. To turn this stream of images into a usable dataset, each pattern must be indexed before integration and merging can proceed. In practice, diffraction patterns may contain only a small number of reliable peaks, be contaminated by background or spuriously detected reflections, or arise from crystals with highly skewed unit cells. These factors make indexing unstable in the small-N regime. We introduce a robust indexing algorithm tailored to this setting. We formulate indexing as a symmetry-aware lattice decoding problem and design a loss that explicitly incorporates lattice symmetries while trimming outlier peaks that are inconsistent with any plausible orientation. We combine this objective with a reciprocal-space basis reparameterization that stabilizes decoding for skewed or poorly conditioned lattices, and we develop a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with a method to recover orientations from very few reflections. The resulting method is memory-efficient and suitable for robust indexing. We evaluate our approach on three protein datasets from the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank collected at XFEL facilities, using identical preprocessing and unit-cell information across methods. Across all datasets, our algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers such as XGANDALF and TORO, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and for crystals with skewed unit cells. While slower, our method is extremely memory-efficient, and its structure allows high-parallelism on CPUs or larger batch sizes on GPUs. These results show that exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness.

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: DPINN (discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network) solves energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows with phase change, addressing gradient conflicts and interface thickness issues in conventional PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PINNs fail for three-phase flows with phase change due to gradient-direction conflicts during optimization of coupled nonlinear equations (Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, Navier-Stokes). Also, interface thickness is artificially magnified in both numerical and AI-based simulations, reducing accuracy.

Method: Proposes DPINN with: 1) discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and automatically detect/model sharp interfaces, 2) learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize near steep gradients, 3) adaptive time-marching strategy to reduce long-term error accumulation, 4) loss-balancing strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training.

Result: Successfully resolves sharp interfacial dynamics in two-phase problems (reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising) where conventional PINNs fail. Extends to three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity/density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing phase-change dynamics and pointy tip formation.

Conclusion: DPINN overcomes limitations of conventional PINNs for multiphase flows by addressing gradient conflicts and interface thickness issues, enabling accurate simulation of three-phase flows with phase change and high viscosity/density ratios.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for modeling multiphase flows. However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are introduced to reduce long-term error accumulation and to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training, respectively. In numerical experiments on the two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems, the proposed method accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics that conventional PINNs fail to converge. It also extends to a three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity and density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing the phase-change dynamics and the formation of the pointy tip.

Conclusion: GANDALF lowers infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, enabling rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware, broadening participation in plasma turbulence research.

Abstract: We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.

Abstract: Achieving reliable real-time control of tokamak plasmas is essential for sustaining high-performance operation in next-generation fusion reactors. A major challenge is the accurate and timely prediction of edge-localized modes (ELMs), especially in high-confinement regimes such as wide-pedestal quiescent H-mode. We present a hardware-accelerated machine learning (ML) inference system integrated into the RTSTAB processing node of the DIII-D real-time diagnostic and control infrastructure. The system uses an AMD/Xilinx KCU1500 FPGA to enable ultra low latency plasma state classification and ELM forecasting. Input features come from real-time Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES), and the ML model is implemented as a dense neural network using the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL).
  A key capability is SNL dynamic parameter loading, which allows on-the-fly updates of neural network weights and biases without hardware resynthesis. This enables multiple classification tasks on a single FPGA design and supports adaptive control strategies that respond to evolving plasma conditions. By decoupling inference from fixed-weight configurations, the system supports continuous model refinement and seamless task switching during live operation.
  The SNL-based inference engine is fully integrated with the FPGA in the DIII-D RTSTAB Plasma Control System (PCS), improving ELM avoidance, confinement, and operational stability. These results show the feasibility of embedding dynamically reconfigurable FPGA-based ML inference into real-time fusion diagnostic pipelines, providing a scalable and resilient path toward intelligent and autonomous plasma control in future magnetic confinement fusion devices.

TL;DR: Generalization of thermodynamically consistent V-e heating model to include electron cooling from vibrationally excited states, maintaining the same heating-to-cooling ratio expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original V-e heating model assumed electron energy loss was dominated by collisions with ground-state molecules, limiting its validity in plasma flows where vibrationally excited populations significantly contribute to electron cooling.

Method: Rigorous generalization of the thermodynamically consistent V-e heating model by deriving the heating-to-cooling ratio while including electron cooling interactions with vibrationally excited states.

Result: The heating-to-cooling ratio exp(θ_v/T_e - θ_v/T_v) remains valid even when electron cooling from vibrationally excited states is included, removing the previous ground-state dominance constraint.

Conclusion: The generalized model extends validity to plasma flows with significant vibrationally excited populations, maintaining thermodynamic consistency while broadening applicability for accurate electron temperature prediction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium plasma flows is critical for applications ranging from hypersonic flight to plasma-assisted combustion. We recently proposed a thermodynamically consistent model for vibrational-electron (V-e) heating [Phys. Fluids 37, 096141 (2025)] which enforces convergence of $T_{\rm e}$ to the vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at equilibrium. While the original derivation assumed electron energy loss was dominated by collisions with ground-state molecules, this Letter presents a rigorous generalization of the model. We demonstrate that the heating-to-cooling ratio $\exp(θ_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-θ_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$ with $θ_{\rm v}$ the characteristic vibrational temperature remains valid even when electron cooling interactions with vibrationally excited states are included. This derivation removes the previous constraint assuming ground-state dominance, thereby extending the model's validity to plasma flows where vibrationally excited populations contribute significantly to electron cooling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how shear Alfvén waves behave in chaotic magnetic fields created by symmetry-breaking perturbations, which is important for plasma confinement in fusion devices.

Method: Use quadratic flux minimized surfaces to create pseudo straight field line coordinates in chaotic regions, then solve reduced ideal MHD equations as eigenvalue problem numerically.

Result: Spectrum computed with varying perturbation strength shows shear Alfvén waves remain relatively unchanged on intact flux surfaces, retain some original features even when flux surfaces are destroyed at large perturbations.

Conclusion: Shear Alfvén waves can persist with recognizable features even in chaotic magnetic field regions, providing insight into wave behavior in non-ideal magnetic confinement configurations.

Abstract: The shear Alfvén spectrum is computed in the presence of symmetry breaking perturbations that introduce chaotic magnetic field trajectories. Quadratic flux minimised surfaces allow the creation of pseudo straight field line coordinates in the chaotic region. With these coordinates, the reduced ideal MHD equations are cast into an eigenvalue problem and solved numerically. The spectrum is computed with varying perturbation strength, showing how shear Alfvén waves change as increasing number of flux surfaces are destroyed. Solutions on specific flux surfaces are shown to remain relatively unchanged while the flux surface remains intact, and retain some original features at large perturbations where the flux surface is destroyed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient, high-order numerical method for simulating collisionless plasmas described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations that overcomes limitations of standard Finite Volume methods.

Method: Active Flux method with additional Degrees of Freedom at cell interfaces, combined with operator splitting to handle high-dimensional Vlasov equation by solving one-dimensional advection equations.

Result: The AF scheme shows significantly lower dissipation and reduced anisotropy compared to semi-Lagrangian Finite Volume methods, producing superior results for standard kinetic test cases with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Active Flux method provides a fast, efficient alternative to standard Finite Volume methods for Vlasov-Maxwell plasma simulations, offering high-order accuracy with compact stencil advantages.

Abstract: Active Flux (AF) is a modified Finite Volume method that evolves additional Degrees of Freedom (DoF) located on the cell interfaces to compute high-order approximations to the numerical fluxes through the respective interface. We present an AF-based scheme for the simulation of collisionless plasmas described by the Vlasov equation coupled with Maxwell's equations. In order to limit the DoF in high dimensional settings we employ operator splitting. The resulting one-dimensional advection equations can be solved efficiently and with low implementation complexity, making it a very fast alternative to standard Finite Volume methods. We compare our scheme's performance with a related Finite Volume method based on the semi-Lagrangian approach. We find that, as a consequence of its compact stencil, the AF scheme has significantly lower dissipation and reduced anisotropy, and thus produces results on par with or even superior to the benchmark for standard test cases reproducing important kinetic phenomena, while also offering lower computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how electrode configurations and spacing influence gas breakdown voltage and the characteristic minimum in Paschen curves, since traditional Paschen law may not fully capture these effects.

Method: Conducted experiments with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes at various inter-electrode distances. Fitted experimental Paschen curves using a modified empirical relation with variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters.

Result: Breakdown voltage and corresponding pd values are influenced by both electrode configurations and discharge gap. Variations in breakdown voltage and pd minima are explained by analyzing electric field distributions between cathode and anode.

Conclusion: Electrode geometry and spacing significantly affect gas breakdown characteristics, requiring modified empirical relations to accurately describe Paschen curves beyond the traditional formulation.

Abstract: Paschen law relates the breakdown voltage of a gas to the product of gas pressure and inter-electrode distance, predicting a characteristic minimum voltage at a specific pd value. In this study, the role of electrode configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) and inter-electrode spacing on the gas breakdown processes (or Paschen Law) is examined. Numerous sets of experiments are performed with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes to obtain Paschen curves at different inter-electrode distances. The experimentally obtained Paschen's curves for different electrode configurations are fitted using a proposed modified empirical relation for breakdown voltage, incorporating variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters to better capture the observed deviations. Upon closer inspection, we observed that the breakdown voltage and the corresponding pd value are influenced by both electrode configurations and the inter-electrode discharge gap. The variation in breakdown voltage and pd minima for different electrode configurations is explained by analyzing the electric field distributions between the electrodes (cathode and anode) for an applied voltage.

TL;DR: A new iterative characteristic approximation method for Vlasov-Maxwell equations that enables high-resolution electron-scale plasma simulations with reduced memory footprint compared to traditional PIC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid models fail for non-thermal/weakly collisional plasmas (like solar wind), while traditional Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are computationally demanding due to 6D phase-space dynamics. PIC methods have memory cost and noise issues for electron-scale studies.

Method: Iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics that reconstructs phase-space dynamics from electromagnetic field history and initial distributions. Uses Hamiltonian splitting for structure-preserving advancement while maintaining reduced memory footprint.

Result: Enables extremely high effective resolution far below phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data. Extends earlier electrostatic method to full Vlasov-Maxwell equations.

Conclusion: Provides an alternative to PIC methods for electron-scale plasma simulations that overcomes memory limitations and noise issues while preserving accuracy through structure-preserving Hamiltonian splitting.

Abstract: Validity of fluid models breaks down for non-thermal or weakly collisional plasmas which often occur e.g. in the solar wind. In these regimes one has to resort to modelling through the first-principle Vlasov-Maxwell system, but its six-dimensional phase-space dynamics, strong filamentation, and multi-scale structure make direct numerical simulation extremely demanding. Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods remain the standard for ion-scale studies, yet their memory cost and intrinsic noise hinder accurate electron-scale simulations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method based on an iterative-in-time approximation of characteristics. The approach reconstructs the phase-space dynamics from the time history of the electromagnetic fields and the initial distribution functions, enabling extremely high effective resolution far below the phase-space grid scale without storing or advecting high-dimensional data. Earlier work demonstrated this capability for the multi-species electrostatic Vlasov system. Here we discuss an extension of the method to the full Vlasov-Maxwell equations using a Hamiltonian splitting to advance the solution in a structure-preserving way while retaining the reduced memory footprint.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of Minkowski inequality for nearly spherical domains that are $C^1$ close to the ball. We show the stability inequalities between the positive part of the $σ_k$ curvature integrals for $C^1$ perturbations of a ball; we also establish the stability inequalities for axially symmetric $C^1$ perturbations of a ball. Finally, we construct a counterexample, illustrating that the inequalities become invalid if we do not compensate the integral with the negative part of the curvature. Our work generalizes Glaudo's results on the mean curvature integral to the fully nonlinear cases.

Motivation: To understand how Ricci-DeTurck flow behaves when starting from rough initial metrics that are only locally integrable or have weak Sobolev regularity, rather than smooth metrics.

Method: Uses Ricci-DeTurck flow theory and analysis of convergence in local Sobolev spaces (L²_loc and W^{1,2+σ}_loc). For closed manifolds, employs distributional scalar curvature theory by Lee-LeFloch to show preservation of curvature bounds.

Result: Shows that Ricci-DeTurck flow solutions converge to initial rough metrics in appropriate Sobolev senses. For closed manifolds, proves that distributional lower bounds on scalar curvature are preserved as smooth lower bounds along the flow.

Conclusion: Ricci-DeTurck flow can handle rough initial metrics and preserves distributional curvature bounds, providing a regularization tool for metrics with limited regularity.

Abstract: We consider Riemannian manifolds $(M^n,g_0)$, $(M^n,h)$, where $(M^n,h)$ is smooth, complete, with curvature bounded in absolute value by $K_0 < \infty$, and $(1-\varepsilon_0(n)) h \leq g_0 \leq (1+\varepsilon_0(n)) h$ for some small $\varepsilon_0(n)>0$. It was shown by Simon (2002) that a Ricci-DeTurck flow solution $g(t)_{t \in (0,T)}$ related to $g_0$ exists for some $T=T(n,K_0)>0$. If $g_0 \in L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ or $g_0 \in W^{1,2+2σ}_{\mathrm{loc}}$, $σ\in (0,\frac{1}{4})$, respectively, we show that $g(t) \to g_0$ in the $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$- or $W^{1,2+σ}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-sense, respectively. If $M$ is closed, $g_0 \in W^{1,2+σ}(M)$ for some $σ>0$, and the distributional scalar curvature of Lee-LeFloch (2015) is not less than $b \in \mathbb{R}$, then we show that $g(t)$ has scalar curvature not less than $b$ in the smooth sense for all $t>0$.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Two local energy methods for distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian systems on 1D domains, used to characterize exponential stability via boundary energy flow, applied to vibrating strings where existing methods fail, and to study short-time behavior with boundary damping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing stability of distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian systems have limitations. The authors aim to develop new local energy methods that can handle cases where current sufficient conditions fail, particularly for systems like networks of vibrating strings, and to better understand short-time behavior in systems with boundary damping.

Method: Developed two local energy methods specifically for distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. These methods analyze energy passing through boundaries over time horizons to characterize exponential stability. Applied to networks of vibrating strings and used to study short-time behavior in systems with boundary damping (related to hypocoercivity).

Result: Successfully derived a characterization of exponential stability directly in terms of boundary energy flow. The condition was verified for a network of vibrating strings where existing sufficient conditions could not be applied. Also provided insights into short-time behavior of pH systems with boundary damping.

Conclusion: Local energy methods provide effective tools for stability analysis of distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian systems, particularly in cases where traditional methods fail. These methods offer new insights into boundary energy flow and short-time behavior, with applications to practical systems like vibrating strings and systems with boundary damping.

Abstract: We develop two local energy methods for distributed parameter port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. The methods are applied to derive a characterization of exponential stability directly in terms of the energy passing through the boundary over a given time horizon. The resulting condition is verified for a network of vibrating strings where existing sufficient conditions cannot be applied. Moreover, we use a local energy method to study the short-time behavior of pH systems with boundary damping which was recently studied in the context of hypocoercivity.

### [65] [Linear and nonlinear late-time tails on dynamical black hole spacetimes via time integrals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23242)
*Dejan Gajic,Lionor Kehrberger*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper proves that on dynamical black hole exteriors settling to Schwarzschild, non-spherically symmetric wave solutions decay slower than Price's law by exactly one power, due to conformal irregularity properties at future null infinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand late-time asymptotic behavior of wave equations on dynamical black hole backgrounds that settle to Schwarzschild, particularly how the decay differs from the well-known Price's law for stationary black holes.

Method: Physical-space approach using energy estimates, treating the dynamical wave operator as Schwarzschild operator plus inhomogeneous term. Relates late-time tails to conformal irregularity properties of time integrals at future null infinity. Uses carefully chosen global tail functions to go from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics.

Result: Non-spherically symmetric solutions from compactly supported initial data decay slower than Price's law by exactly one additional power of time. The method is applied to nonlinear wave equations and shown to be robust for dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr and higher-dimensional wave operators.

Conclusion: Late-time tail behavior on dynamical black hole backgrounds fundamentally differs from stationary cases, with slower decay linked to conformal irregularity properties. The physical-space approach provides a robust framework applicable to various generalizations including nonlinear equations and different spacetime geometries.

Abstract: We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.
  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.
  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.

*Ruiqi Gao,Pinchen Xie,Roberto Car*

TL;DR: Electron-aware machine learning force field combines quantum mechanical electron modeling with ML-learned interactions to study solvated electron reactions in water, achieving ab initio accuracy at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-learning force fields in molecular simulations lack explicit electron modeling, limiting their ability to accurately capture electron-related phenomena like solvated electron reactions.

Method: Developed an electron-aware ML force field where the excess electron is modeled quantum mechanically, while short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce DFT calculations.

Result: Successfully applied to solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with hydronium ion, identifying proton transfer mechanism. Determined reaction rates (350-450K) with 3.2 kcal·mol⁻¹ activation energy matching experiments, and calculated equilibrium constant consistent with measurements.

Conclusion: The electron-aware ML force field enables accurate simulation of electron-involved processes at reduced computational cost, bridging quantum mechanical accuracy with ML efficiency for studying solvated electron chemistry.

Abstract: In molecular simulations, machine-learning force fields can achieve ab initio accuracy at a lower cost but remain limited in the explicit modeling of electrons. In this work, we develop an electron-aware machine-learning force field, in which an excess electron of interest is modeled quantum mechanically, while the remaining short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce a density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate the method on the solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with a hydronium ion. We identify a proton transfer mechanism by which the excess proton recombines with the electron. We determine the forward reaction rates between 350 K and 450 K from first-passage survival functions, which yield an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of 3.2 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, in good agreement with experiment. From an enhanced sampling simulation, we determine the equilibrium constant, and thus the reaction free energy, which is also consistent with experimental measurements.

### [67] [Convergence rates of self-repelling diffusions on Riemannian manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23333)
*Francis Lörler*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Self-repelling diffusions on manifolds with trajectory-dependent drift are shown to be equivalent to finite-dimensional degenerate diffusions that are second-order lifts of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, enabling analysis of convergence rates to stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds where the drift depends on the accumulated history of the trajectory, and to analyze their convergence properties to stationary distributions.

Method: When the interaction potential has suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics are shown to be equivalent to finite-dimensional degenerate diffusions. These are identified as second-order lifts of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Convergence analysis uses the framework of second-order lifts and flow Poincaré inequalities for lower bounds.

Result: The paper obtains a general upper bound on convergence rate using second-order lift framework. Lower bounds are developed using flow Poincaré inequalities. In periodic cases, these lower bounds improve upon previous work by Benaïm and Gauthier (2016) and sometimes match the order of the upper bound.

Conclusion: Self-repelling diffusions with spectral interaction potentials can be analyzed as second-order lifts of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, enabling precise convergence rate analysis that improves upon existing results in periodic settings.

Abstract: We study a class of self-repelling diffusions on compact Riemannian manifolds whose drift is the gradient of a potential accumulated along their trajectory. When the interaction potential admits a suitable spectral decomposition, the dynamics and its environment are equivalent to a finite-dimensional degenerate diffusion. We show that this diffusion is a second-order lift of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose invariant law corresponds to the Gaussian invariant measure of the environment, and immediately obtain a general upper bound on the rate of convergence to stationarity using the framework of second-order lifts. Furthermore, using a flow Poincaré inequality, we develop lower bounds on the convergence rate. We show that, in the periodic case, these lower bounds improve upon those of Benaïm and Gauthier (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016), and even match the order of the upper bound in some cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand electron-electron interactions in metals by accurately calculating vertex functions and Landau parameters, which can explain experimental thermal resistivity measurements.

Method: Variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo for high-precision ab initio calculations of four-point vertex function, extraction of Landau parameters, and development of sKO⁺ effective interaction model.

Result: Revealed density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening, proposed accurate sKO⁺ effective interaction, and computed electron-electron thermal resistivity that matches experimental measurements.

Conclusion: The sKO⁺ effective interaction accurately captures electron-electron scattering and explains thermal resistivity in simple metals, demonstrating the importance of vertex corrections in electron gas physics.

Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Study shows different effects of hydrodynamic vs. wall actuation on oil droplet mobilization in deformable constricted tubes - hydrodynamic actuation shows monotonic frequency dependence while wall actuation exhibits resonance effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different actuation mechanisms (hydrodynamic vs. wall actuation) affect droplet transport through deformable constricted tubes, with potential applications in precise control of droplet transport for bio-microfluidic systems.

Method: Used high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations to analyze oil droplet mobilization in a deformable, actuated constricted tube under two actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on tube walls). Studied effects of actuation frequency and amplitude.

Result: Hydrodynamic actuation: mobilization time increases monotonically with frequency and decreases with amplitude. Dynamic wall actuation: shows resonance effect - mobilization time reaches minimum at frequency near tube's resonant frequency.

Conclusion: Different actuation mechanisms produce fundamentally different droplet transport behaviors in deformable tubes, with wall actuation offering resonance-based control. This highlights potential for precise droplet manipulation in bio-microfluidic applications.

Abstract: We study the mobilization of an oil droplet in a deformable, actuated constricted tube subjected to two different actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force in the fluid) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on the tube walls). Using high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations, we analyze the effects of actuation frequency and amplitude on droplet transport through the constriction. Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency. Our study highlights the potential of actuation mechanisms in deformable tubes for precise control of droplet transport in bio-microfluidic applications.

### [70] [An Efficient and Accurate Surrogate Modeling of Flapping Dynamics in Inverted Elastic Foils using Hypergraph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22012)
*Aarshana R. Parekh,Rui Gao,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A graph neural network surrogate model is developed to predict self-induced flapping dynamics of inverted elastic foils in fluid flow, enabling efficient long-term simulation for energy harvesting optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity simulations of fluid-structure interaction in flapping foils are computationally expensive, making design optimization across broad configuration spaces impractical. There's a need for efficient surrogate models that can accurately predict these dynamics for energy harvesting applications.

Method: Developed a rotation-equivariant quasi-monolithic graph neural network (GNN) surrogate for inverted foil dynamics. Used proper orthogonal decomposition to compress structural mesh motion, advanced through multilayer perceptron, while GNN evolves flow field. Extended hypergraph framework to flexible self-oscillating foils, capturing nonlinear vortex-structure coupling.

Result: The GNN surrogate achieves <1.5% error in predicting tip displacement and force coefficients over thousands of time steps, accurately reproduces dominant vortex-shedding frequencies, and captures energy transfer metrics within 3% of full-order simulations with long-term stability.

Conclusion: The developed GNN surrogate provides an efficient and accurate alternative to expensive high-fidelity simulations for long-horizon prediction of unsteady flow-structure dynamics in energy-harvesting systems, enabling practical design optimization.

Abstract: Cantilevered elastic foils can undergo self-induced, large-amplitude flapping when subject to fluid flow, a widely observed phenomenon of fluid-structure interaction, from fluttering leaves or the movement of fish fins. When harnessed in steady currents, these oscillations enable the extraction of kinetic energy from the flow. However, accurately predicting these dynamics requires high-fidelity simulations that are prohibitively expensive to perform across the broad configuration space needed for design optimization. To address this, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) surrogate for the inverted foil problem, modeled as an elastically mounted rigid foil undergoing trailing-edge pitching in uniform flow. The coupled fluid-structure dynamics are solved using a Petrov-Galerkin finite element method with an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, providing high-fidelity data for training and validation. The surrogate uses a rotation-equivariant, quasi-monolithic GNN architecture: structural mesh motion is compressed via proper orthogonal decomposition and advanced through a multilayer perceptron. At the same time, the GNN evolves the flow field consistent with system states. Specifically, this study extends the hypergraph framework to flexible, self-oscillating foils, capturing the nonlinear coupling between vortex dynamics and structural motion. The GNN surrogate achieves less than 1.5% error in predicting tip displacement and force coefficients over thousands of time steps, while accurately reproducing dominant vortex-shedding frequencies. The model captures energy transfer metrics within 3% of full-order simulations, demonstrating both accuracy and long-term stability. These results show a new, efficient surrogate for long-horizon prediction of unsteady flow-structure dynamics in energy-harvesting systems.

TL;DR: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene with intrinsic polarization enables quantum anomalous Hall states without external electric fields through interplay of correlations and spin-orbit coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how intrinsic spontaneous polarization in ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene interacts with electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling to create topological phases, potentially offering advantages over ABCA stacks that require external electric fields.

Method: Employed a k·p model combined with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to investigate electronic ground states, examining different interaction strengths (U=6 eV and U=8 eV).

Result: Found that intrinsic polarization with strong interactions (U=8 eV) and SOC drives a C=3 quantum anomalous Hall state without external electric field. At moderate interactions (U=6 eV), minimal electric field is needed. Also predicted correlation-driven metallic phases like quarter- and three-quarter-filled states.

Conclusion: The synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs rich topological phenomena, establishing ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological states without requiring external electric fields.

Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.

### [72] [A Novel $J_M$-Based Method for Interpolation in Metric Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22126)
*Roblêdo M M Sette*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: New $J_M^{\prime}$-interpolation method for metric spaces based on approximating sequences in intersection space with $J_M(1)$ metric, yielding relative completion in union space with controllable metric relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich metric-space interpolation theory by developing a new interpolation method that provides additional tools beyond existing $K$ and $J$ methods, particularly useful for applications in Nonlinear Analysis and Wasserstein-type spaces.

Method: Constructs $J_M^{\prime}$-interpolated metric space using approximating sequences in intersection space $X_0 \cap X_1$ equipped with $J_M(1)$ metric, then performs relative completion within union space $X_0 \cup X_1$.

Result: Successfully defines a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics, preserving Lipschitz properties of operators between interpolated spaces.

Conclusion: The $J_M^{\prime}$-interpolation method provides a valuable new construction for metric-space interpolation, expanding available tools while maintaining desirable properties like Lipschitz preservation, with potential applications in nonlinear analysis and Wasserstein spaces.

Abstract: We present a new interpolation method for metric spaces, termed the \emph{$J_M^{\prime}$-interpolated metric space}. Building on previous work where two interpolation methods were developed in analogy with Peetre's classical $K$ and $J$ methods, this approach introduces a distinct construction based on approximating sequences in the intersection space $X_0 \cap X_1$ equipped with the metric $J_M(1)$. The method defines a relative completion within the union space $X_0 \cup X_1$, yielding a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between the $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics. While we do not compare this method to the previously developed approaches nor explore its correspondence with classical interpolation functors in normed spaces, the construction enriches the set of tools available for metric-space interpolation theory. Furthermore, as expected, these methods still preserve the Lipschitz property of an operator between two interpolated spaces.
  Potential applications include general Nonlinear Analysis and Wasserstein-type spaces where the sequence-based nature of the method may provide practical advantages.

### [73] [Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova Representation of Quasi-Norms of Ball Quasi-Banach Function Spaces on Spaces of Homogeneous Type with Weak Reverse Doubling Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22960)
*Eiichi Nakai,Menghao Tang,Dachun Yang,Wen Yuan,Chenfeng Zhu*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: The paper establishes limit formulas relating fractional Sobolev norms to the original function norm in ball quasi-Banach function spaces on homogeneous metric measure spaces, generalizing Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the celebrated Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova result (2002) about the limit behavior of fractional Sobolev seminorms as s→0+ from classical L^q spaces to more general ball quasi-Banach function spaces on homogeneous metric measure spaces.

Method: Introduces two new concepts: weak reverse doubling condition (for the space) and weak measure density condition (for domains). Uses these conditions to prove limit formulas relating the fractional Sobolev norm to the original function norm via careful analysis of the difference quotient integrals.

Result: Proves that for functions in Y(𝒳)∩∪_{s∈(0,1)} Ẇ^{s,q}_Y(𝒳), the limit as s→0+ of s^{1/q} times the fractional Sobolev seminorm equals the original function norm (up to constants). The result applies to ten specific ball quasi-Banach function spaces and also extends to domains.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova-type results to broad classes of function spaces on homogeneous metric measure spaces, introducing novel geometric conditions (weak reverse doubling and weak measure density) that are shown to be necessary in some sense for such results.

Abstract: Let $Y(\mathcal{X})$ be a ball quasi-Banach function space on the space of homogeneous type $(\mathcal{X},ρ,μ)$ satisfying some mild additional assumptions, $q\in(0,\infty)$, and $\dot{W}^{s,q}_Y(\mathcal{X})$ with $s\in(0,1)$ be the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space associated with $Y(\mathcal{X})$. In this article, we show that, for any $f\in Y(\mathcal{X})\cap\bigcup_{s\in(0,1)} \dot{W}^{s,q}_Y(\mathcal{X})$, \begin{align*} \|f\|_{Y(\mathcal{X})} &\lesssim\varliminf_{s \to 0^+} s^{\frac{1}{q}}\left\| \left\{\int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{|f(\cdot)-f(y)|^q}{U(\cdot,y)[ρ(\cdot,y)]^{sq}} \, dμ(y) \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}\right\|_{{Y(\mathcal{X})}}\\ &\leq \varlimsup_{s \to 0^+} s^{\frac{1}{q}}\left\|\left\{\int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{|f(\cdot)-f(y)|^q}{U(\cdot,y)[ρ(\cdot,y)]^{sq}} \, dμ(y) \right\}^{\frac{1}{q}}\right\|_{{Y(\mathcal{X})}} \lesssim\|f\|_{Y(\mathcal{X})}, \end{align*} where $U(x,y):=\min\{μ(B(x,ρ(x,y))),\,μ(B(y,ρ(x,y)))\}$ for any $x,y\in\mathcal{X}$ and the implicit positive constants are independent of $f$, which is applied to ten specific ball quasi-Banach function spaces and hence is of wide generality. In particular, when $Y(\mathcal{X})=L^q(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $q\in[1,\infty)$, the above formula is closely related to the celebrated result of Maz'ya and Shaposhnikova in 2002. We also establish the above representation formula on domains of $\mathcal{X}$. The main novelty lies in proposing two new concepts, namely the weak reverse doubling condition (for $\mathcal{X}$) and the weak measure density condition (for domains of $\mathcal{X}$), which are proved to be necessary in some sense. In addition, we find an interesting fact that, when the underlying space under consideration is bounded, the above Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova-type limit always tends to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework for analyzing attractors in nonautonomous random dynamical systems that depend on both time and random parameters, addressing limitations of existing uniform attractor concepts.

Method: Introduces minimal uniform attractor concept, provides examples, develops symbol space compactification techniques adapted from deterministic theory, establishes stability via deterministic-random dynamics relationship, and shows topological conjugacy between stochastic flows and random differential equations.

Result: Successfully defines minimal jointly uniform attractor concept, demonstrates applicability through examples, develops compactification method for non-compact symbol spaces, proves stability properties, and establishes natural occurrence in time-dependent stochastic differential equations.

Conclusion: The minimal uniform attractor provides a robust framework for nonautonomous random systems, with practical applications to stochastic differential equations with time-dependent noise, bridging deterministic and random dynamics theories.

Abstract: We introduce a notion of minimal uniform attractor for nonautonomous random dynamical systems, which depends jointly on time and on a random parameter. Several examples are provided to illustrate the concept and to compare it with existing notions of uniform attractors in the literature. We further apply the abstract theory to nonautonomous random differential equations with a non-compact symbol space. In particular, we develop a method to compactify the symbol space, by adapting techniques from the theory of deterministic nonautonomous differential equations. We also establish the stability of the minimal jointly uniform attractor by exploiting the relationship between deterministic and random dynamics. Finally, we show that such structures arise naturally in stochastic differential equations whose noise terms carry additional time dependence, by establishing a topological conjugacy between the resulting stochastic flows and suitable random differential equations.

It serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers to evaluate which wave models to use in coastal and oceanographic research.

Abstract: Predicting ocean wave behavior is challenging due to the difficulty in choosing suitable numerical models among many with varying capabilities. This review examines the development and performance of numerical wave models in coastal engineering and oceanography, focusing on the difference between phase-averaged spectral models and phase-resolving models. We evaluate the formulation, governing equations, and methods of widely used third-generation phase-averaged spectral models (SWAN, WAVEWATCH III, MIKE 21 SW, TOMAWAC, and WAM) alongside advanced phase-resolving models (FUNWAVE, SWASH, COULWAVE, and NHWAVE) that employ Boussinesq-type equations and non-hydrostatic formulations. The review begins with early parameterized models and progresses to contemporary third-generation models, which solve the wave action conservation equation with few spectral constraints. A comparison of the models' efficiency, accuracy in nearshore conditions, ability to resolve nonlinear wave-wave interaction, simulate wave breaking, diffraction, and wave-current interactions is provided. Applications in operational forecasting, extreme event simulation, coastal structure design, and assessing climate change impacts are discussed. The validation of these models and the statistical metrics and intercomparison studies used are addressed. A discussion of the limitations in computational scalability, physics parameterization, and model coupling is provided, along with emerging trends in high-resolution modeling and hybrid models. This review guides researchers in evaluating which models to use in coastal and oceanographic research.

TL;DR: Researchers developed and benchmarked four machine-learned interatomic potentials (ACE, MACE, GAP, tabGAP) for YBCO high-temperature superconductors to enable large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation damage in fusion reactor applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-temperature superconductors like YBCO are critical for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, but their superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure. Understanding radiation-damage mechanisms is essential for maintaining material performance in harsh fusion environments, requiring accurate atomistic simulations that DFT alone cannot provide at sufficient scale.

Method: Developed and benchmarked four machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP). These were trained on an extensive DFT database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations.

Result: All four models achieved DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes. MACE delivered the highest accuracy but at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provided an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity.

Conclusion: The machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials, enabling detailed study of radiation damage mechanisms in YBCO for fusion reactor applications.

Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials

### [77] [A Finite Element Method for Simulation of Coupled Dynamics of Dislocations and Fracture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22676)
*Boyang Gu,Adrian Diaz,Yang Li,Youping Chen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A finite element method for simulating coupled dislocation motion and crack propagation using Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum formulation with unit-cell level discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate and efficient computational method that can simulate the complex coupled evolution of dislocations and cracks in crystalline materials, bridging atomistic and continuum scales.

Method: Uses Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of linear momentum conservation, discretizing crystalline materials at unit-cell level with 6-node prism elements that allow dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets.

Result: Excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for nanoscale simulations of Cu, Fe, and Si. Mesoscale simulations of Cu capture size-dependent brittle/ductile behavior: plane-strain conditions show brittle fracture, while 3D models show curved/intersecting dislocations that blunt crack tips and prevent propagation (ductile behavior).

Conclusion: The method provides accurate, efficient simulation of coupled dislocation-crack evolution, successfully capturing size-dependent material behavior and bridging atomistic to mesoscale phenomena in crystalline materials.

Abstract: This work presents a finite element method for simulating dynamic processes that involve the coupled evolution of dislocation motion and crack propagation. The method numerically solves the Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of the conservation of linear momentum. A crystalline material is discretized at the unit-cell level using 6-node prism elements whose geometry allows dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets. Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the method are discussed.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Proposed geometrically nonlinear continuum models of flexomagnetism using Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress theories, introducing magneto-mechanical coupling via micro-dislocation tensor and magnetization vector with Lifshitz invariant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient flexomagnetic models that avoid complex fourth-order tensor couplings of conventional strain-gradient formulations, enabling simpler parameterization for centrosymmetric and cubic-symmetric materials.

Method: Used Cosserat micropolar and couple-stress theories to couple micro-dislocation tensor (second-order) with magnetization vector via Lifshitz invariant, resulting in third-order tensor couplings. Derived governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations.

Result: Models allow centrosymmetric materials with single flexomagnetic constant and cubic-symmetric materials with two constants. Numerical results for nano-beam geometry confirm physical plausibility and computational feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed geometrically nonlinear continuum models provide a more efficient framework for flexomagnetism with simpler parameterization and demonstrated computational viability for practical applications.

Abstract: We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.

### [79] [Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564)
*Ruiyu Han*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: SMC algorithm for sampling Gibbs measures on Rd with non-convex energy at low temperature, achieving polynomial time complexity in inverse temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work on torus (compact setting) had polynomial time complexity, but approach failed for non-compact Rd. Need to extend results to practical non-compact settings.

Method: Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from Gibbs measures with non-convex energy functions at low temperatures on Rd.

Result: Convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity scaling as ~β^7·ε^{-2}·δ^{-2}, where β is inverse temperature, ε is absolute error, δ is probability error.

Conclusion: Successfully extends polynomial-time SMC sampling from compact torus to non-compact Rd, overcoming previous technical obstacles for practical applications.

Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on Rd with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. In an earlier joint work, we proved that the algorithm samples from Gibbs measures supported on torus with time complexity that is polynomial in the inverse temperature; however, the approach breaks down in the non-compact setting. This work overcomes this obstacle and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the seventh power of the inverse temperature, the square of the inverse allowed absolute error and the square of the inverse allowed probability error.

### [80] [Nature of frontier quasi-particle states in nitrogen-base systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23171)
*Raul Quintero-Monsebaiz,Per Hyldgaard,Elsebeth Schröder*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses advanced density functional theory (AHBR-mRSH*) to study electron-attached and ionized quasi-particle states in DNA components, focusing on dipole/multipole-trapped empty states to understand DNA photophysics and propose a reactivity model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding DNA photophysical properties is crucial for elucidating how charges and free radicals impact cellular environments, predicting damage from photoemission/inverse photoemission events, and controlling potential damage through understanding quasi-particle excitations.

Method: Utilizes the recently developed optimally tuned range-separated hybrid vdW density functional (AHBR-mRSH*) to analyze electron-attached and ionized quasi-particle states of DNA components, with focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances).

Result: Evaluated critical properties including dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Classified Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature.

Conclusion: The classification provides foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity, enabling better understanding and potential control of DNA damage mechanisms.

Abstract: Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.

*Hossein Abedi,Mohammadsadegh Khazali,Klaus Mølmer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Using quantum optimal control to design single continuous laser pulses for implementing multi-qubit gates (controlled-phase, -NOT, -swap) on Rydberg atom quantum processors with high fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different quantum computing implementations have direct multi-qubit interactions, but standard decompositions use elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Leveraging native multi-qubit capabilities can reduce operation time and decoherence.

Method: Quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that directly implement multi-qubit gates (controlled-phase, -NOT, and -swap/Fredkin) on Rydberg atom quantum processors.

Result: Achieved 99.74% fidelity for controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate while accounting for imperfections including spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing. Reduced operation time and continuous protection from environmental noise.

Conclusion: Quantum optimal control enables robust, high-fidelity multi-qubit gates on Rydberg atom processors, leveraging native multi-qubit interactions to reduce decoherence and improve performance against realistic imperfections.

Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Markovian dynamics in waveguide QED: Time delays break superradiant bursts into structured photon trains and generate entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how finite time delays in photon exchange among emitters affect superradiant decay in waveguide quantum electrodynamics, moving beyond the Born-Markov approximation.

Method: Employ tensor-network methods to simulate non-Markovian dynamics of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide, accounting for finite time delays in photon exchange.

Result: Superradiant bursts break into structured trains of correlated photons with each intensity peak corresponding to specific photon numbers; emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement emerges, with latter appearing in long-time limit as excitation becomes trapped in singlet subspace; time delays can lead to decay rates exceeding Markovian predictions for symmetric Dicke states.

Conclusion: Time delays fundamentally alter superradiant dynamics, transforming coherent bursts into structured photon trains and generating entanglement, with implications for quantum information processing and light-matter interactions beyond Markovian approximations.

Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.
