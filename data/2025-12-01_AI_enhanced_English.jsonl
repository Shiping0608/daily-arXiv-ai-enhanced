Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed.

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\u00f3rdoba-C\u00f3rdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations.
