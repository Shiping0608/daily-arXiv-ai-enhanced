The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods.

These thermal loads can manifest in various detrimental effects, including melting, sputtering, cracking, blistering, and other forms of material degradation. While the ELMs are an intrinsic feature of H-mode operation in Tokamaks, runaway electrons pose a potential threat across all Tokamak device scales.In devices such as ITER, even with mitigation strategies, the ELMs can still impose considerable heat loads on the PFMs, reaching levels of approximately 1 MJ/m2. Various methods exist to experimentally simulate the heat load effects of ELMs on PFMs. In this study, the thermal loads from REs in small-scale Tokamaks are considered for this purpose.The presence of small-scale Tokamaks, exemplified by the Damavand experiment, facilitates the investigation of RE energy deposition. Analysis of the experimental data indicates that the REs populations generated by plasma instabilities within the Damavand Tokamak discharges exhibit heat densities on the order of MJ/m2 to 1 cm2 area PFMs. Furthermore, considering an average REs energy of 1 MeV and the prevailing discharge current, calculations indicate that the average total energy of the REs population per discharge is approximately 1 kJ, which is subsequently deposited on the Tokamak limiter. Considering the limiter's surface area and assuming that only 40% of the REs energy is transferred to it, the calculated heat load density reaches the order of MJ/m2, comparable to that observed during the ELMs events in large-scale fusion devices.

To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints.

Previous local gyrokinetic studies have shown that turbulent energy exchange can exceed collisional exchange in weakly collisional plasmas, and that ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence may hinder ion heating by alpha-heated electrons. In addition, it has been clarified that trapped electron mode (TEM) turbulence transfers energy from electrons to ions, thereby enhancing ion heating.

This approach corresponds to solving the phase field equations, such as the Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations, and the hydrodynamic equations, typically the Navier-Stokes and pressure equations for pseudo-incompressible fluids. Due to the high density ratio, the higher-order numerical truncation errors associated with spatial density gradients can become significant. These errors can lead to problems such as inaccuracies in shear stress, violations of Galilean invariance, and undesirable dependencies on absolute pressure for the pseudo-incompressible solutions.
