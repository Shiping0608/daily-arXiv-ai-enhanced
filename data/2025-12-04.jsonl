The new method integrates temporal encoding, operator learning and UNet to approximate the mapping between vector spaces of random parameter and spatiotemporal flow fields. The new discrete neural operator can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the SOTA attention-residual-UNet structure. Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set."}

The integrator is designed for finite-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems that derive from variational principles. The action is discretized using quadratic finite elements interpolation of the state and Simpson's quadrature, leading to discrete motion equations. The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method."}

White", "José Luis Velasco", "Iván Calvo", "Elizabeth J. Paul"], "title": "Energetic-particle orbits near rational flux surfaces in stellarators: I. Passing particles", "categories": ["physics.plasm-ph"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent simulations have shown that, even when the magnetic field of a stellarator possesses nested toroidal flux surfaces, the orbits of passing energetic particles can exhibit islands. These 'drift islands' arise near rational flux surfaces, where they are likely to enhance alpha-particle transport -- flattening the alpha density profile locally -- unless they can be avoided by suitable design of the stellarator magnetic field. To investigate how this might be achieved, we derive an equation for the drift-island shape in a general stellarator. This result follows from the solution to a more fundamental problem: that of calculating the orbits of passing particles near a rational flux surface. We show that these orbits are determined by conservation of an adiabatic invariant associated with the closed rational-surface field lines. We use this 'transit adiabatic invariant' to prove that there are no drift islands, for all passing particles, if and only if the magnetic field satisfies a weaker version of the Cary-Shasharina condition for omnigeneity; we call such magnetic fields 'cyclometric'. The drift-island width scales as $\\sim (ρ_\\starδ/s)^{1/2} a$ ($ρ_\\star$ is the normalized gyroradius, $δ$ is the deviation from cyclometry, $s$ is the magnetic shear, and $a$ is the minor radius), so large drift islands could arise in low-shear stellarators that are insufficiently cyclometric. To ensure accurate results for very energetic particles, we compute higher-order corrections to the transit invariant. Our calculations agree extremely well with ASCOT5 guiding-centre and full-orbit simulations of alpha particles in reactor-scale equilibria, even at $3.5\\text{MeV}$. Finally, we show how our results can also be derived using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, which provides a systematic framework for calculating passing-particle orbits on both rational and irrational surfaces."}

This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves."}

Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere."}

MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an elec- tron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code. The simulation demonstrates that MBI occurs even for finite spheres, and high-density compression is still achievable with this setup. It also shows the opti- mal target structure, which maximizes ion flashing."}

Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant. Our approach is model-agnostic, applicable to multi-component systems with solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions, and compliant with top-down training on other experimental properties.

In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 °C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 °C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows."}

Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere."}

To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $α_\\text{SS}$.

Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits.\n  The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems."}

The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfvénic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations."}

This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves."}

Consequently, detailed computational modeling of this tissue represents a formidable task, requiring both efficient numerical methods and robust implementations.

Here, we present a computational framework that models electrodiffusion in excitable cerebral tissue, together with realistic geometries generated from electron microscopy data. To demonstrate a possible application of the framework, we simulate electrodiffusive dynamics in cerebral tissue during neuronal activity.

The first eigenvalue is always negative. We show that if the second eigenvalue is positive then there are no waves with multiple periods in a neighborhood of the Stokes wave."}

This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities.\n  We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call \"strong non-degeneracy\". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem."}

The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of Cauchy problems for weak solutions to second-order degenerate parabolic equations with a non-smooth, time-dependent degenerate elliptic part that includes both bounded and unbounded lower-order terms. The unbounded lower-order terms are allowed to lie in mixed time-space Lebesgue or even Lorentz spaces. Our notion of weak solutions is formulated under minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions. We also establish $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates for the fundamental solution and derive Gaussian upper bounds under the weak assumption of Moser's $L^2$-$L^\\infty$ estimates for weak solutions. Our approach is purely variational and avoids any a priori regularity assumptions on weak solutions or regularization via smooth approximations. Two key ingredients are norm inequalities for fractional powers of the degenerate Laplacian, and a set of embeddings that ensure time continuity of weak solutions, extending the classical Lions regularity theorem and accommodating a wide class of source terms."}

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop\" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery."}
