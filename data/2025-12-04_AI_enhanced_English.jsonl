Passing particles", "categories": ["physics.plasm-ph"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent simulations have shown that, even when the magnetic field of a stellarator possesses nested toroidal flux surfaces, the orbits of passing energetic particles can exhibit islands. These 'drift islands' arise near rational flux surfaces, where they are likely to enhance alpha-particle transport -- flattening the alpha density profile locally -- unless they can be avoided by suitable design of the stellarator magnetic field. To investigate how this might be achieved, we derive an equation for the drift-island shape in a general stellarator. This result follows from the solution to a more fundamental problem: that of calculating the orbits of passing particles near a rational flux surface. We show that these orbits are determined by conservation of an adiabatic invariant associated with the closed rational-surface field lines. We use this 'transit adiabatic invariant' to prove that there are no drift islands, for all passing particles, if and only if the magnetic field satisfies a weaker version of the Cary-Shasharina condition for omnigeneity; we call such magnetic fields 'cyclometric'. The drift-island width scales as $\\sim (\u03c1_\\star\u03b4/s)^{1/2} a$ ($\u03c1_\\star$ is the normalized gyroradius, $\u03b4$ is the deviation from cyclometry, $s$ is the magnetic shear, and $a$ is the minor radius), so large drift islands could arise in low-shear stellarators that are insufficiently cyclometric. To ensure accurate results for very energetic particles, we compute higher-order corrections to the transit invariant. Our calculations agree extremely well with ASCOT5 guiding-centre and full-orbit simulations of alpha particles in reactor-scale equilibria, even at $3.5\\text{MeV}$.

MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an elec- tron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code.

In this article, we propose a novel superfast direct inversion method for type-III NUDFT. The proposed method approximates the type-III NUDFT matrix as a product of a type-II NUDFT matrix and an HSS matrix, where the type-II NUDFT matrix is further decomposed into the product of an HSS matrix and an uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix as in [Wilber, Epperly, and Barnett, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(3):A1702-A1732, 2025]. This decomposition enables both the forward application and the backward inversion to be accomplished with quasi-linear complexity. The fast inversion can serve as a high-accuracy direct solver or as an efficient preconditioner. Additionally, we provide an error bound for the approximation under specific sample distributions. Numerical results are presented to verify the relevant theoretical properties and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "A superfast direct inversion method for type-III NUDFT using hierarchical semi-separable (HSS) matrix decompositions with quasi-linear complexity.", "motivation": "The nonuniform discrete Fourier transform (NUDFT) and its inverse are widely used in scientific computing, but efficient inversion methods are needed for practical applications.", "method": "Approximates type-III NUDFT matrix as product of type-II NUDFT matrix and HSS matrix, with type-II NUDFT further decomposed into HSS matrix and uniform DFT matrix, enabling quasi-linear complexity for both forward application and backward inversion.", "result": "Provides error bound for approximation under specific sample distributions, and numerical results verify theoretical properties and demonstrate efficiency.", "conclusion": "The method serves as high-accuracy direct solver or efficient preconditioner for type-III NUDFT inversion with quasi-linear complexity."}}
