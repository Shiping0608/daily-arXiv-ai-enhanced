Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail.

Under stronger conditions on the fluxes, we provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system that corresponds to the energy of the underlying dispersive equation.

We establish improved convergence rates for the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem associated with the corresponding non-divergence form difference operators, surpassing the $O(R^{-1})$ rate, which is expected to be optimal for environments with a finite range of dependence. In particular, the improved rates are $O(R^{-3/2})$ when $d=3$, and $O(R^{-2}\\log R)$ when $d\\geq 4$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Improved convergence rates for homogenization of Dirichlet problems in random environments: O(R^{-3/2}) for d=3 and O(R^{-2}log R) for d\u22654, surpassing optimal O(R^{-1}) rate for finite-range dependent environments.", "motivation": "To establish improved convergence rates for homogenization of Dirichlet problems associated with non-divergence form difference operators in random environments, going beyond the expected optimal O(R^{-1}) rate for environments with finite range of dependence.", "method": "Study random walks in balanced, i.i.d. random environments in \u2124^d for d\u22653, analyzing the homogenization of Dirichlet problems for corresponding non-divergence form difference operators.", "result": "Achieved improved convergence rates: O(R^{-3/2}) when d=3, and O(R^{-2}log R) when d\u22654, which surpass the expected optimal O(R^{-1}) rate for environments with finite range of dependence.", "conclusion": "The paper demonstrates that better-than-optimal convergence rates can be achieved for homogenization in random environments, with dimension-dependent improvements that significantly exceed the expected O(R^{-1}) bound for finite-range dependent settings."}}

For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\u03ba^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\u03b1$ and on the limiting curvatures $\u03ba_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)\\,r_0(\u03b1,\u03ba_+, \u03ba_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(\u03c0/2)=1/(16\\sqrt\u03c0)$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient.
