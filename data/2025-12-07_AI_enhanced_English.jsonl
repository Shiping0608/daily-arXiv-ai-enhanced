H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems.

For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\u03ba^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\u03b1$ and on the limiting curvatures $\u03ba_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)\\,r_0(\u03b1,\u03ba_+, \u03ba_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector.
