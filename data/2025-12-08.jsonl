In unfitted configurations, these methods impose consistent modified boundary conditions on the computational boundary. Due to the high algebraic complexity of very high order schemes, the stability is studied by visualizing the eigenspectrum of the discretized operators. A recent study on the SB method demonstrated that its Taylor expansion can be formulated as a direct polynomial correction. In this work, we prove that the ROD minimization problem admits an analogous polynomial correction. This unified perspective provides significant benefits: algorithmically, it greatly simplifies the implementation of ROD by eliminating the need for linear system inversions at each iteration; mathematically, it enables a rigorous stability study. For completeness, a side-by-side stability analysis of the ROD and SB methods is presented for polynomials up to degree 6. Furthermore, due to the stability restrictions of embedded methods for hyperbolic problems, a coupling with both explicit and implicit time integration is investigated. A set of numerical experiments confirms the findings of the stability study."}

This comparison is made possible by extending the open TCV-X21 dataset with 2D turbulence measurements obtained with Gas Puff Imaging (GPI), providing critical information on the size, velocity, and other key characteristics of turbulent filaments at the outboard midplane and in the divertor region. For the comparison, GBS simulations of TCV-X21 are analyzed using a dedicated synthetic GPI diagnostic that models the neutral helium-plasma interaction and emission processes and accounts for line-integration effects. Poloidal and radial filament velocities are found to be in good agreement between simulations and experiments, while the simulations overestimate the filament radial and poloidal sizes and underestimate the relative fluctuation levels. The simulations further indicate that filaments in the SOL are predominantly represented by density perturbations rather than temperature perturbations, consistent with previous assumptions in experimental analyses of cross-field turbulent transport from GPI data. The poloidal velocity direction of the filaments agrees with the time-averaged $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ direction at the outboard midplane and X-point region, but not in the divertor leg.

In contrast to thresholding or machine learning methods, this approach requires no training data or empirical parameter tuning, and its outputs remain interpretable through direct links to imaging physics and statistical decision theory.\n  Through numerical simulations we demonstrate robust count accuracy across weak signals, variable backgrounds, magnification changes and moderate PSF mismatch. Particle resolvability tests further reveal characteristic error modes, including under-counting at very small separations and localized over-counting near the resolution limit. Practically, we also confirm the algorithm's utility, through application to experimental dark-field images comprising a nanoparticle-based assay for detection of DNA biomarkers derived from SARS-CoV-2. Statistically significant differences in particle count distributions are observed between control and positive samples. Full count statistics obtained further exhibit consistent over-dispersion, and provide insight into non-specific and target-induced particle aggregation.

The dispersion relation, which is valid in arbitrary toroidal geometry, takes into account resonances with the magnetic ion and bounce-averaged electron drifts, incorporates non-local effects along the magnetic field line, is valid for arbitrary sign of the growth rate and magnetic curvature, and is shown to satisfy a variational property. Several common approximation models are introduced for both the magnetic drift and finite Larmor radius (FLR) damping, with the Padé approximation for FLR effect in particular resulting in remarkable agreement with the baseline dispersion relation model at significantly reduced costs. The baseline model is verified by comparing solutions of the dispersion relation model to high-fidelity linear gyrokinetic simulations, where the exact eigenfunction of the electrostatic potential from simulations is used as a trial function, showing good quantitative agreement for ITGs and TEMs in (shaped) tokamaks as well as low-magnetic-shear stellarators."}

Although fine-tuning is essential for adapting these pretrained models to specific target systems, the influence of the optimization algorithm on this process remains insufficiently characterized. In this work, we perform a rigorous benchmark of seven first-order optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, SGD, LAMB, Ranger, and ScheduleFree, for the fine-tuning of foundation models across molecular, crystalline, and liquid regimes. We evaluate these algorithms based on energy and force accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution configurations, as well as their impact on downstream physical properties such as elastic moduli, phonon spectra, and interfacial dynamics. We interpret these empirical results through a preconditioning framework that views each optimizer as a data-dependent linear transformation of the gradient. This analysis clarifies how different update rules impose specific spectral filters on the effective loss Hessian. Across all regimes, AdamW and ScheduleFree achieve superior curvature conditioning and force accuracy, whereas stochastic gradient descent exhibits slow convergence and instability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a brief second-order refinement stage reduces residual anisotropy in the loss landscape and enhances the fidelity of physical observables without increasing inference costs. These findings provide conceptual insight and practical guidance for selecting and designing optimizers to ensure the stable and efficient fine-tuning of universal interatomic potentials."}

By normalizing the stiffness kn by kstar = G*m^2/R^3 and time by the free-fall time t_ff, I perform systematic parameter campaigns over dissipation (gamma) and normalized stiffness ktilde = kn/kstar.

The fields produced by the ions and experienced by a witness electron beam are purely electrostatic, being the ions at rest in the laboratory frame on the time scale of interest and it can be represented with the field distribution produced by a 3D charged ellipsoidal. The energy spread and emittance degradation has been studied by slicing the bunch in an array of cylinders and solving envelope equations for each bunch slice. The properties of transverse envelope and emittance oscillations and energy spread degradation have been analyzed together with the related matching conditions for optimal transport and acceleration."}

The reason for this is that time-dependent problems usually do not exhibit the necessary coercive structure that is used in optimality proofs to show a certain quasi-orthogonality, which is crucial for the theory. Recently, by using a new equivalence between quasi-orthogonality and inf-sup stability of the underlying problem, it was shown that an adaptive Crank-Nicolson scheme for the heat equation is optimal under a severe step size restriction. In this work, we use this new approach towards quasi-orthogonality together with a Radau IIA method that combines the advantages of the Crank-Nicolson and implicit Euler schemes. We obtain the first adaptive time stepping method for non-stationary PDEs that is provably rate optimal with respect to number of time steps vs. approximation error. Together with a reduced basis method that leverages the Laplace transform for building tailored subspaces of reduced dimension, we obtain a very efficient method."}

Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes.

Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics. Comments welcome", "summary": "A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($Δx < H_{\\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($Δx \\ll H_{\\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($Δx \\gg H_{\\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors."}

Liu, J. Comp. Phys., 228(19), 2009]. The method enforces the divergence-free constraint implicitly, removing velocity--pressure compatibility conditions and eliminating pressure boundary layers. Consistent boundary conditions are imposed, also for settings with open and traction boundaries. Hence, accuracy in time is no longer limited by a splitting error.\n  The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method is used for second spatial derivatives. The convective term is treated in a semi-implicit manner, which relaxes the CFL restriction of explicit schemes while avoiding the need to solve nonlinear systems required by fully implicit formulations. For improved mass conservation, Leray projection is combined with divergence and normal continuity penalty terms.\n  By selecting appropriate fluxes for both the divergence of the velocity field and the divergence of the convective operator, the consistent pressure boundary condition can be shown to reduce to contributions arising solely from the acceleration and the viscous term for the $L^2$ discretization. Per time step, the decoupled nature of the scheme with respect to the velocity and pressure fields leads to a single pressure Poisson equation followed by a single vector-valued convection-diffusion-reaction equation. We verify optimal convergence rates of the method in both space and time and demonstrate compatibility with higher-order time integration schemes. A series of numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional flow around a cylinder benchmark and the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex problem, verify the applicability to practically relevant flow problems."}

The energies under consideration consist of a non-convex bulk term and a higher-order regularizing term and are subject to incompatible boundary conditions. In contrast to existing results in the literature, in this work, admissible fields are not necessarily gradient fields, instead their curl is linked to topological singularities, so-called vortices, in the discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-model. The main result of this work is a scaling law for the minimal energy with respect to three parameters: one measuring the incompatibility of the boundary conditions, the second measuring the strength of the regularizing term, and the third being related to the interatomic distance in the discrete model. The shown result implies in particular that in certain parameter regimes, minimizers necessarily develop vortices. A key tool in the analysis is a careful modification of the celebrated ball-construction technique that, due to a lack of rigidity, considers simultaneously both the bulk energy and the regularizing term."}

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%.

The valley splitting can be magnified in moiré superlattices owing to the superposition of Umklapp excitons folded from moiré minibands, yielding spatially modulated and enhanced magnetic proximity.

To resolve the non-uniqueness of ground states induced by phase invariance, we work on a quotient manifold endowed with a general Riemannian metric. By introducing an auxiliary phase-aligned iteration and employing fixed-point convergence theory, we establish a unified local convergence framework for Riemannian gradient descent methods and derive explicit convergence rates. Specializing this framework to two metrics tailored to the energy landscape, we study the energy-adaptive and Lagrangian-based Riemannian gradient descent methods. While monotone energy decay and global convergence are established only for the former, a quantified local convergence analysis is provided for both methods. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that the Lagrangian-based method, which incorporates second-order information on the energy functional and mass constraints, achieves faster local convergence than the energy-adaptive scheme."}

Conventional algorithms for its computation typically rely on matrix-adjoint products, making them sensitive to errors arising from adjoint mismatches. To address this issue, we introduce a stochastic zeroth-order Riemannian algorithm that maximizes the generalized Rayleigh quotient without requiring adjoint or matrix inverse computations. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees showing that the iterates converge to the set of global maximizers of the (generalized) Rayleigh quotient at a sublinear rate with probability one. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."}

The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem."}
