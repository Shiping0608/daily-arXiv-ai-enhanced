Our analysis requires a careful derivation of the dimension dependence of several fundamental tools in the theory of finite element methods, including the elliptic regularity, Bramble--Hilbert lemma, trace inequalities, and inverse inequalities. We further introduce a new quasi-interpolation operator into finite element spaces, a variant of the classical Scott--Zhang interpolation, whose associated constants scale polynomially with the dimension. Building on these ingredients, we prove a multilevel norm equivalence theorem and derive a BPX preconditioner with explicit polynomial bounds on its dimensional dependence. This result has notable implications for emerging quantum computing methodologies: recent studies indicate that polynomial dependence of BPX preconditioners on dimension can yield exponential speedups for quantum-algorithmic approaches over their classical counterparts."}

First, we construct the explicit polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) using a least-squares approach. Then, f is reconstructed by solving the degree-2 polynomial equation a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0 for any $x \\in [-1,1]$, where an index function is used to select the correct sign in the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula-based nonlinear approximation (degree-2 in f) outperforms classical orthogonal polynomial-based least-squares approximation (degree-0 in f) and rational approximation (degree-1 in f) for functions with sharp transitions or discontinuities. As a potential application, we apply the degree-2 representation to data denoising. Instead of relying on more complex \"edge-preserving\" metric-based optimization techniques, the smooth coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) enable effective least-squares-based denoising on the low-dimensional manifold described by the algebraic variety a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0. Denoising the index function, which determines the appropriate root to select, can be achieved using classical statistical or modern classification/clustering techniques. Numerical results and data denoising examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the degree-2 nonlinear approximation technique. The new nonlinear, quadratic formula-based representation also raises theoretical and numerical questions, including strategies for identifying numerically stable representations, developing optimal algorithms to construct the polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x), and achieving economical representation and denoising of the index function."}

At these scales, phonon transport follows the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), which captures non-diffusive (ballistic) effects but is too costly to solve repeatedly in inverse-design loops. Existing surrogate approaches trade speed for accuracy: fast macroscopic solvers can overestimate conductivities by hundreds of percent, while recent data-driven operator learners often require thousands of high-fidelity simulations. This creates a need for a fast, data-efficient surrogate that remains reliable across ballistic and diffusive regimes. We introduce a Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) that combines a differentiable Fourier solver with a neural generator and couples it with uncertainty-driven active learning. The Fourier solver acts as a physical inductive bias, while the network learns geometry-dependent corrections and a mixing coefficient that interpolates between macroscopic and nano-scale behavior. PEDS reduces training-data requirements by up to 70% compared with purely data-driven baselines, achieves roughly 5% fractional error with only 300 high-fidelity BTE simulations, and enables efficient design of porous geometries spanning 12-85 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ with average design errors of 4%. The learned mixing parameter recovers the ballistic-diffusive transition and improves out of distribution robustness. These results show that embedding simple, differentiable low-fidelity physics can dramatically increase surrogate data-efficiency and interpretability, making repeated PDE-constrained optimization practical for nano-scale thermal-materials design."}

Starting from the conservative BDY exchange mechanism, we rely on kinetic theory for multi-agent systems in order to propose an analogue continuous dynamics, which does not belong to the class of other popular kinetic models for wealth exchange. We employ the quasi-invariant limit procedure to rigorously derive a nonlinear PDE on the half-line, which is a Fokker-Planck equation featuring the boundary value in the drift term. The PDE is supplemented with a nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition encoding conservation of total agents and wealth. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, which converges in relative entropy to the unique stationary state that is the Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential) distribution. We determine the $L^1$ convergence (up to subsequences) of the solution toward this equilibrium: this requires us to make a step forward with respect to established arguments of entropy decay for Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, our results, which bridge the discrete stochastic dynamics with a continuous deterministic evolution equation, provide a novel and influential wealth exchange model in a PDE framework, which opens up many new applicative scenarios and methodological analytical challenges."}

The Fourier pseudo-spectral method is limited to periodic domains and suffers from Gibbs oscillations in non-periodic problems. The Chebyshev method mitigates this issue but requires edge-clustered grids, which does not match the characteristics of many physical problems. To overcome these restrictions, we propose a B-spline-periodized Fourier (BSPF) method that extends to non-periodic problems while retaining spectral-like accuracy and efficiency. The method combines a B-spline approximation with a Fourier-based residual correction. The B-spline component enforces the smooth matching of boundary values and derivatives, while the periodic residual is efficiently treated by Fourier differentiation/integration. This construction preserves spectral convergence within the domain and algebraic convergence at the boundaries. Numerical tests on differentiation and integration confirm the accuracy of the BSPF method superior to Chebyshev and finite-difference schemes for interior-oscillatory data. Analytical mapping further extends BSPF to non-uniform meshes, which enables selective grid refinement in regions of sharp variation. Applications of the BSPF method to the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional shallow water equations demonstrate accurate resolution of sharp gradients and nonlinear wave propagation, proving it as a flexible and efficient framework for solving non-periodic PDEs with high-order accuracy."}

Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics."}

Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -> 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation.

Our findings highlight the advantages of multi-resolution inductive bias for capturing multi-scale flow dynamics and suggest the need for future PIML models to embed EOS knowledge to enhance physical fidelity."}

Building on the normalization strategy introduced by Perdomo and Plaza for triangles, we construct a canonical representation of tetrahedra in a normalized space embedded in the product of the hyperbolic half-plane and the hyperbolic half-space model. This representation allows us to define the left and right refinement maps, $Φ_L$ and $Φ_R$, acting on the space of normalized tetrahedral shapes, and to study their iterative orbits as discrete dynamical systems. Using these maps, we show that the orbit of the space-filling Sommerville tetrahedron contains only 4 similarity classes, 3 of which form an attractive cycle corresponding to the orbit of the path tetrahedron. We also show that small perturbations of elements in those orbits still lead to finite orbits. In addition, we study small perturbations of the regular tetrahedron and show that their orbits are also finite. Extensive numerical exploration of orbits for the other types of tetrahedra suggests that the LEB algorithm does not produce degenerating tetrahedra. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for analyzing the shape evolution of tetrahedral meshes and offers a possible route toward an analytic proof of the non-degeneracy property for the tetrahedral partitions generated by the LEB refinements. This property is highly desired in e.g. the finite element methods (FEMs)."}

Furthermore, we deduce that these coupling terms give rise to well-known expressions for vacuum polarization, in addition to quantum modifications proportional to the content of real particles. Depending on the initial plasma density, the dominant quantum corrections to classical evolution may arise from real particle couplings or from the vacuum polarization associated with virtual particles.

The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics."}

In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions.

A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses."}

These are expected to reduce the non-turbulent background plasma transport to acceptable neoclassical levels while removing nearly all collisionless direct orbit losses of alpha particles. Yet, alpha particles under resonant conditions can be very sensitive to collisions, causing concerning energy losses and damaging plasma facing components. For the passing alphas such resonances can happen near rational surfaces in the presence of helical error field departures from quasisymmetry that change the magnetic field direction and magnitude. The cancellation between streaming motion and tangential drift of the alphas enhances the effective collision frequency, allowing the formation of a collisional boundary layer and giving rise to a perturbed distribution function. We develop an analytical model to illustrate and evaluate the resonant plateau transport this mechanism causes by formulating a drift kinetic treatment. The results indicate the associated energy losses can become significant in the vicinity of rational surfaces at values of q=m/n when error fields with poloidal and toroidal numbers m and n are present. In addition, we investigate the validity of the quasilinear approximation to the energy flux to show that it imposes a restriction on the error field amplitude that can be considered."}

Submitted to Journal of Plasma Physics", "summary": "The solar wind is observed to undergo substantial heating as it expands through the heliosphere, with measured temperature profiles exceeding those expected from adiabatic cooling. A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it \"cuts across\" perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations."}

However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems."}

In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an \"intertwinement.\" A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration."}

From this viewpoint, the CB method applies a volume-preserving projection to the map, systematically removing spurious compressible errors arising from time integration, interpolation, or from velocity fields that are only approximately divergence-free. This projection bends the characteristics toward the divergence-free space, preserving mass and geometric features of the advected fields, even in the presence of significant error. We demonstrate the method in both two and three dimensions using benchmark problems and for multiphase flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The results show that the CB method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes and as an augmentation of reference map formulations, offering improved robustness and accuracy in incompressible flow simulations."}

However, its temporal discretization has largely remained limited to second-order implicit schemes. The present work aims at advancing this direction through the introduction of Runge-Kutta (RK) schemes within the VMS framework in a mathematically consistent manner. Guided by the Rothe method, the half-explicit RK scheme is employed as its accuracy is theoretically guaranteed for index-2 differential-algebraic equations. Owing to the explicit treatment of the nonlinear term, the resulting spatial problem exhibits a structure analogous to that of the Darcy equation. Following the philosophy of the VMS analysis, a subgrid-scale model is derived without invoking linearization based on perturbation series and related assumptions. The analysis further reveals that the parameter in the subgrid model is independent of the spatial mesh size. Fourier analysis demonstrates that the Rothe method, compared with the conventional vertical method of lines, provides improved dissipation and dispersion properties and exhibits a larger stability region for convection-dominated regimes. In the Taylor-Green vortex benchmark, the proposed schemes demonstrate superior performance as a large-eddy simulation model, achieving higher fidelity in predicting the kinetic energy evolution, energy spectra, and vortex structures than the conventional VMS formulation. Simulations of the open cavity flow further show that the proposed schemes can accurately capture the periodic limit cycle caused by the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, confirming its effectiveness and fidelity for highly sensitive flow instability problems."}

However, airfoil design in rarefied gas flows remains underexplored because solving the Boltzmann equation formulated in a six dimensional phase space is time consuming. To address this problem, a solver-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework for symmetric, thickness-only airfoils is developed. First, airfoils are parameterized using a class shape transformation that enforce geometric admissibility. Second, a Gaussian process expected improvement surrogate is coupled in batches to a fast converging, asymptotic preserving Boltzmann solver for sample efficient exploration. Drag minimizing airfoils are identified in a wide range of gas rarefaction. It is found that, at Mach numbers Ma=2 and 4, the streamwise force increases with the gas rarefaction and shifts from pressure dominated to shear dominated drag, while optimization reduces drag at all conditions. The benefit of optimization peaks in the weakly rarefied regime, about 30% at Ma=2 and 40 to 50% at Ma=4, and falls to a few percent in transition and free-molecular flow regimes. Drag decomposition shows that these gains come mainly from reduced pressure drag, with viscous drag almost unchanged. The optimal airfoils form a coherent rarefaction-aware family: they retain a smooth, single-peaked thickness profile, are aft-loaded at low gas rarefaction, and exhibit a forward shift of maximum thickness and thickness area toward mid-chord as gas rarefaction increases. These trends provide a physically interpretable map that narrows the design space."}

However, acquiring high-resolution, high-fidelity functional flow data is costly and taxing for the patient. As a result, there is growing interest in using highly undersampled MRI data to reduce acquisition time and thus the cost, while maximizing the information gain from the data. Examples of such recent work include inverse problems to estimate boundary conditions of aortic blood flow from highly undersampled k-space data. The undersampled data is selected based on a predefined sampling mask which can significantly influences the performance and the quality of the solution of the inverse problem. While there are many established sampling patterns to collect undersampled data, it remains unclear how to select the best sampling pattern for a given set of inference parameters. In this paper we propose an Optimal Experimental Design (OED) framework for MRI measurements in k-space, aiming to find optimal masks for estimating specific parameters directly from k-space. As OED is typically applied to sensor placement problems in spatial locations, this is, to our knowledge, the first time the technique is used in this context. We demonstrate that the masks optimized by employing OED consistently outperform conventional sampling patterns in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and variance, facilitating a speed-up of 10x of the acquisition time while maintaining accuracy."}

In addition, it is more difficult to obtain the uniform estimates for the error $(R_{0},R_{1},R_{-1})$ between the real solutions and the approximate solutions, due to the extra interactions with the temperature. To overcome the difficulties aroused by resonances and loss of derivatives, we find several important structural identities between the diagonalized unknowns and apply a series of normal-form transforms, to obtain uniform estimates for the error over the desired $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ long time scale."}

We develop an abstract optimal recovery framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for reconstructing unknown target functions from mixed equality and inequality functional constraints. Within this framework, the approximation of $v^*$ is cast as a collocation-type problem derived from verification conditions for optimality -- most prominently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- that uniquely characterizes $v^*$. As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $Ω$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $Ω$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions. Furthermore, we show that a practical numerical realization of the abstract scheme reduces to the classical policy iteration algorithm. Numerical experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene."}

While the forward problems for such transport-type PDEs have been extensively and intensively studied, their corresponding inverse problems--which aim to reconstruct unknown operators, cost functions, or interaction kernels from observed solution data--remain largely unexplored at this level of generality.\n  The cornerstone of our theory is a systematic approach featuring high-order calculus on the Wasserstein space and a progressive variational scheme. This methodology is specifically designed to address the challenges inherent in inverse problems for infinite-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonlocal transport PDEs.\n  We demonstrate the power and versatility of our theory through two canonical examples: inverse problems for both the Mean Field Control (MFC) Dynamic Programming Equation and the Mean Field Game (MFG) Master Equation. Our work provides, for the first time, a unified foundation for identifying cost functions and interaction kernels from value function data. This establishes a new and fertile field of mathematical research with significant implications for both theory and applications in stochastic control and mean field games."}

Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity."}

Specifically, we study the anisotropic analogue of the Allen-Cahn energy and establish a Modica-type gradient bound for its critical points. Using this in conjunction with certain estimates for stable solutions, we then prove that the energy densities of stable or bounded-Morse-index critical points of its rescalings concentrate along an integer rectifiable varifold that is stationary for the underlying anisotropic integrand. As a consequence, we construct a (possibly singular) anisotropic min-max hypersurface via Allen-Cahn, obtaining an analogue of the result of Hutchinson-Tonegawa in the anisotropic setting."}

The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schrödinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics."}

In particular, we show that if the $X$-Bakry-Émery-Ricci curvature $\\mathrm{Ric}_{X}$ is non-negative and the norm of $X$ decays to zero at infinity, then the manifold has the Liouville property for the $X$-Laplacian. The proof exploits a local gradient estimate for positive solutions to the semilinear equation $Δ_{X}u+F(u)=0$, which holds when $F$ satisfies the structural conditions $tF'(t)-F(t)\\leα$ and $\\vert F(t)\\vert\\leβt$, and the manifold has $\\mathrm{Ric}_{X}\\ge-(n-1)K$."}

In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{μν})$ containing a caustic $\\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics."}
