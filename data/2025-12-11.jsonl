Numer. Math., 48 (2023), pp. 247-280] to the setting of non-matching mixed-dimensional grids. The extension is achieved by introducing transfer grids between the planar subdomain and interface grids, together with stable discrete projection operators for primal (potential) and dual (flux) variables. The proposed non-matching estimators remain fully guaranteed and computable. Numerical experiments, including three-dimensional problems based on community benchmarks for incompressible Darcy flow in fractured porous media, demonstrate reliable performance of the estimators for the non-matching grids and effectivity that is comparable to the estimators for matching grids."}

Indeed, most fundamental physics laws are expressed as relationships between derivatives in space and time. However, derivatives are rarely directly measurable and must instead be computed, often from noisy, potentially corrupt data streams. There is a rich and broad literature of computational differentiation algorithms, but many impose extra constraints to work correctly, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, or are compromised in the presence of noise and corruption. It can therefore be challenging to select the method best-suited to any particular problem. Here, we review a broad range of numerical methods for calculating derivatives, present important contextual considerations and choice points, compare relative advantages, and provide basic theory for each algorithm in order to assist users with the mathematical underpinnings. This serves as a practical guide to help scientists and engineers match methods to application domains. We also provide an open-source Python package, PyNumDiff, which contains a broad suite of methods for differentiating noisy data."}

The current approach represents each snapshot with time-varying bases consisting of two-dimensional in-plane modes and one-dimensional spanwise modes, together with a reduced covariance matrix. We derive closed-form evolution equations for these time-varying components and advance them over time, requiring only a small rolling window and avoiding full-history storage. Applied to extreme vortex gust-airfoil interaction at Re=5000, we examine how in-plane modes and their associated energy level evolve across gust conditions of varying intensity and size. Before impingement, the first in-plane mode dominates; after impingement, the second mode gains energy_amplified by stronger/larger gusts. A larger leading-mode energy gap implies coherent structure and faster recovery; a smaller gap with slower decay indicates richer multiscale activity and delayed re-stabilization. These trends follow the transient lift dynamics as well, with higher amplitude and more oscillations indicated by a rise in the leading singular values.

It has been demonstrated that the skin effect increases the mean free path of particles in turbulent plasma, thereby reducing its anomalous resistance.

The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control.

This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations.\n  The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models.\n  By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems."}

Incorporating carefully selected feedstock materials within the blanket allows fusion systems to generate both electrical power and high-value isotopes, expanding the space of viable concepts, significantly enhancing the economic value of fusion energy, and supporting an accelerated path to adoption. We calculate the value of this co-generation and derive a new economic breakeven condition based on net present value. At lower plasma gain, $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\lesssim1-3$, high-value transmutation, such as medical radioisotopes, enables pure transmuter fusion systems operating at only a few megawatts of fusion power: for example, a 3 megawatt system transmuting ${}^{102}\\mathrm{Ru}\\rightarrow{}^{99}\\mathrm{Mo}$ could fulfill global ${}^{99}\\mathrm{Mo}$ demand with $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\ll1$. At higher gain $Q_{\\mathrm{plas}}\\gtrsim3$, it becomes viable to generate electricity in addition to isotopes.

We further highlight techniques to enhance transmutation including magnetic mirrors, asymmetric neutron wall loading, and neutron multiplication.

Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called \"overlap function\" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers.

The ingradients of the method include the approximation space recently proposed, a discontinuous Galerkin scheme extensively used, and a linear system solver with a natural preconditioner. Comparing to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, we refer to the new method as being more efficient in the following sense. The numerical performance of the new method shows that: 1) much less error can be reached using the same degrees of freedom; 2) the sparse matrix therein has much fewer nonzero entries so that both the storage space and the solution time cost for the iterative solver are reduced; 3) the preconditioner is proved to be optimal with respect to the mesh size in the absorbing case. Such advantage becomes more pronounced as the approximation order increases."}

This paper introduces GEARS (Geant4 Example Application with Rich features yet Small footprint), a universally applicable Geant4 application that fundamentally addresses this issue. GEARS achieves complete simulation configurability without C++ recompilation by strictly utilizing external configuration methods: Geometry is defined via simple text-based configuration, the Physics List is selected via the standard PHYSLIST environment variable, and the Primary Source is defined through the General Particle Source (GPS) macro commands. Furthermore, regarding GEARS as an application instead of a framework, key features include a flat ntuple structure with short variable names for highly efficient analysis and a solution for capturing vital step zero data. Output creation is also fully managed via run-time macro commands and volume properties. The project is distributed as a ready-to-use Docker container to eliminate compilation barriers. Through these design considerations, GEARS transforms Geant4 into a practical, ready-to-use tool, enabling users to rapidly prototype and execute simulations for diverse experiments solely through simple text configuration files, without ever needing to modify or compile the underlying C++ source code."}

In this process, the beam generates a coherent transition radiation field and subsequently emits gamma rays through nonlinear Compton scattering. By manipulating the initial azimuthal momentum of the beam, the polarization angle of gamma rays relative to the transverse momentum can be controlled, yielding tunable hybrid CV polarization states.

This study proposes an innovative higher-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method, aimed at accurately and efficiently computing the transient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling problems of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales. In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments. It can be summarized that this scalable and robust HOTS computational approach offers a reliably numerical tool for nonlinear multiphysics simulation of large-scale heterogeneous structures in real-world applications."}

Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences."}

An ion-acoustic surface wave exists in the regime of dense plasma flows when their dynamic pressure is of the order of the pressure of an undisturbed magnetic field, so that the flows push the initial magnetic field out of their volume. The wave frequency is in the range between the ion gyrofrequencies inside the plasma bundle and in the outer region of the confining magnetic field. In the external rarefied medium, the near-surface structure is a heterogeneous magnetic sound, consistent in pressure and low total polarisation of the medium with the ``isotropic'' ion sound confined from the inside in a dense plasma bundle. The energy of the structure is mainly contained in the kinetic energy of the wave motion of ions inside the tube. At the same time, the electric field strength is sharply increased outside. Firstly, the latter circumstance arises from the need to maintain a uniform electron electric drift velocity inside the transition layer. Secondly, the energetically weak ion sound propagating into the outer environment is close to electrostatic ion oscillations below the ion gyrofrequency in the external region, which are characterised by increased electric field strength across the ambient magnetic field."}

As the diffraction intensities $I$ are highly sensitive to subtle structural changes, local structure optimization is essential for assessing the validity of a structure model and finding the best-fit structure. The calculation of diffraction intensities is well established, but the large number of evaluations required for reliable structural optimization renders it computationally demanding. The computational effort is mitigated by the tensor-LEED approximation, which accelerates optimization by applying a perturbative treatment of small deviations from a reference structure. Nevertheless, optimization of complex structures is a tedious process.\n  Here, the problem of surface-structure optimization is reformulated using a tree-based data structure, which helps to avoid redundant function evaluations. In the new tensor-LEED implementation presented in this work, intensities are computed on the fly, eliminating limitations of previous algorithms that are limited to precomputed values at a grid of search parameters. It also enables the use of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Implemented in \\textsc{Python} with the JAX library, the method provides access to gradients of the $R$ factor and supports execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on these developments, the computing time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude."}

This study investigates how Landau damping modifies the nonlinear evolution of KAWs by solving a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures both dispersive and nonlinear effects. Without Landau damping, modulational instability drives rapid self-focusing into intense magnetic filaments, producing a turbulent cascade with $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling in the inertial range ($k_\\perpρ_i<1$) that transitions to $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ at sub-ion scales ($k_\\perpρ_i>1$), here $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field and $ρ_i$ the ion thermal gyroradius. When Landau damping is included, magnetic structures are significantly suppressed, and the spectrum steepens to $k_\\perp^{-11/3}$ in the sub-ion range while the inertial range maintains $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ scaling. The damping acts across all scales through resonant wave-particle interactions, efficiently transferring energy from waves to particles. Direct comparison with Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations shows that the observed kinetic range spectral slope falls between our undamped and damped simulation limits, consistent with an intermediate damping regime in magnetosheath turbulence. This agreement confirms that Landau damping is one of the primary mechanisms controlling turbulent energy dissipation at kinetic scales in collisionless plasmas."}

In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The \"pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $κ$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona."}

The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive."}

Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona."}

When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes.

In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy.

Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation. These results indicate that the propagator-based multi-level Monte Carlo scheme is a promising candidate for use in fully implicit Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solvers for coupled plasma-neutral systems."}

Crucially, while previous work [Chen et al., 2025] demonstrated that GNNs with 3-WL expressive power can approximate Strong Branching, we prove a sharper result: node-anchored Subgraph GNNs whose expressive power is strictly lower than 3-WL [Zhang et al., 2023] are sufficient to approximate Strong Branching scores. However, our extensive empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets reveals a stark contrast between theory and practice. While node-anchored Subgraph GNNs theoretically offer superior branching decisions, their $O(n)$ complexity overhead results in significant memory bottlenecks and slower solving times than MPNNs and heuristics.

Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies."}

In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples."}
