This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability.

The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $\u0394u^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function.
