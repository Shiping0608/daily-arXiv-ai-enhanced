The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data."}

We validate the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the solver on models with up to five subsystems, and compare its performance against two state-of-the-art agent-based methods: Tau-leaping and hybrid methods. Our scheme resolves subsystem distributions captured by these stochastic approaches while preserving mass numerically, requiring significantly less computational time and resources, and avoiding variability and hyperparameter tuning characteristic of these methods."}

Our focus is on computing constrained minimizers of functionals - or, equivalently, by considering the associated Euler-Lagrange equations - the solution of a class of eigenvalue problems that may involve nonlinearities in the eigenfunctions. We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective. Alongside a discussion of the metric-driven approach for a model problem, we also demonstrate its application to simulating the ground states of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates."}

The spectrum of scattered waves propagating in a specific direction is presented as a function of wavelength to show that the electron (ion) feature is amplified and becomes asymmetric or distorted when Buneman (ion acoustic) instability occurs. An additional simulation is conducted for a weak, linearly stable beam-plasma system with a hot beam, and confirmed that the obtained scattered wave spectrum shows asymmetric feature.

Despite this, we show that the free boundary has a robust structure.\n  We decompose the free boundary into three parts: (1) a regular part that advances with finite speed in time; (2) a singular part consisting of points where the front attains infinite speed or nucleates, but with controlled space-time (i.e., $\\leq d-1$ parabolic) dimension; and (3) a jump component, which can have large dimension in a time slice, but which is contained in a space-time smooth graph and occurs only at a zero-dimensional set of times. Examples show that each of these parts can be nonempty.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the free boundary is the graph $t=s(x)$ of a continuously differentiable freezing time $s$, and the singular set coincides with the critical set of $s$, proving that singularities in supercooled freezing always occur with infinite speed.\n  These results provide the first free boundary regularity theory for the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions."}

Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches."}

The optimization identifies the maximum electron energy that a self-guided laser wakefield accelerator, driven by a laser of a given energy, can produce, together with the corresponding acceleration distance. Our results further demonstrate that electrons with energies close to the maximum value can be obtained across a relatively wide range of input parameters and without the need for their precise tuning.

However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results."}

As of now, fission reactors have only been considered for electric power generation, but the reactor coolant could also be used directly to heat those processes to their required temperatures. In this work, a concept for a co-generation fission power plant on the Moon that can directly heat a MSE plant to the required temperatures and provide a surplus of electrical energy for the lunar base is presented. The neutron transport code Serpent 2 is used to model a ceramic core, gas-cooled very-high-temperature microreactor design and estimate its lifetime with a burnup simulation in hot conditions with an integrated step-wise criticality search.

By discretizing this operator, we obtain a matrix approximation. Importantly, this discretization provides not only an approximating operator but also an approximating semigroup. This point motivates our approach, as we then apply Balakrishnan's representations of fractional powers of operators, which are based on semigroups. Using estimates of the semigroup norm and the norm of the difference between the operator and its matrix approximation, we derive the convergence rate for the approximation of the fractional power of operators with the fractional power of correspondings matrix operators. In addition, an explicit formula for calculating an arbitrary power of a two-band matrix is obtained, which is indispensable in the numerical solution of fractional differential and integral equations."}

The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead.

Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability.

Using spin-polarized density functional theory with the GGA plus U method, we examine how adsorption affects structure, electronic, magnetic, optical, elastic, and piezoelectric properties. The original monolayer shows half-metallicity, strong spin polarization, and a moderate in-plane piezoelectric effect.

While existing research heavily focuses on applications for undirected graphs such as community detection and core extraction, there have been relatively less attention on directed graphs.\n  In this paper, we introduce a definition of Ricci curvature and an accompanying curvature flow for directed graphs. Crucially, for strongly connected directed graphs, this flow admits a unique global solution. We then apply this flow to detect strongly connected subgraphs from weakly connected directed graphs. (A weakly connected graph is connected overall but not necessarily strongly connected). Unlike prior work requiring graphs to be strongly connected, our method loosens this requirement. We transform a weakly connected graph into a strongly connected one by adding edges with very large artificial weights. This modification does not compromise our core subgraph detection. Due to their extreme weight, these added edges are automatically discarded during the final iteration of the Ricci curvature flow.\n  For core evaluation, our approach consistently surpasses traditional methods, achieving better results on at least two out of three key metrics.

Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $Δu^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function.

As a reference line, we revisit the classical schemes, rooted in Pontryagin's maximum principle, and highlight their sensitivity to local convexity and lack of monotone convergence. We then develop an alternative method based on exact cost-increment formulas and finite-difference probes of the terminal cost. We show that our method exhibits stable monotone convergence in numerical analysis of an Amari-type neural field control problem."}

The main difficulty is that the system is not strongly dissipative. Using L. Simon's convergence theorem, we show that the dynamics of the noiseless system converge in large time to the minimizer of the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, which is unique due to the boundary condition. We obtain an estimate of the invariant measure on the bounded set in the Sobolev space $W^{k^\\star,p^\\star} $, where $k^\\star p^\\star>1$, and $p^\\star$ is large. As a corollary of the main result, we show that $μ_ε$ concentrates around the unique minimizer with such boundary conditions exponentially fast when $ε$ is sufficiently small."}

We develop a comprehensive spectral theory on a weighted Hilbert space, establishing the Plancherel identity, the inversion formula, the convolution theorem, and a Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle depending on the geometric deformation. Furthermore, we utilize this framework to rigorously define the weighted fractional Laplacian with respect to a function, denoted by $(-Δ_{φ,ω})^{s}$. Finally, we apply these tools to solve the generalized time-space fractional diffusion-wave equation, demonstrating that the fundamental solution can be expressed in terms of the Fox H-function, intrinsically related to the generalized $ω$-Mellin transform introduced in \\cite{Dorrego}.
