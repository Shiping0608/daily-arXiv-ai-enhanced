The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead.

Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability.

However, from the perspective of forming a macroscopic flow pattern optimized for heat-exchange efficiency, a uniform lattice is not necessarily the optimal configuration. This study initially presents a macroscopic modeling approach for a two-fluid heat exchanger equipped with a TPMS Primitive lattice. The macroscopic flow analysis is conducted based on the Darcy--Forchheimer theory. Under the assumption that heat is transferred solely at the interface between the fluid and the TPMS walls, a macroscopic heat-transfer model is developed using a volumetric heat-transfer coefficient, which serves as an artificial property characterizing the unit-volume heat-transfer capability. To regulate the relative dominance of the hot and cold flows-effectively, the channel widths-within the heat exchanger, we adopt the isosurface threshold of the Primitive lattice as the design variable and construct an optimization scheme for the lattice distribution using the previously described macroscopic model. The optimization is subsequently carried out for a planar heat exchanger where the hot and cold fluids each follow U-shaped flow trajectories. The optimal solution was verified, and its validity was examined through detailed geometric analysis and experiments conducted using metal LPBF. The optimal solution derived from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance advantage over the uniform lattice in the experimental results. The optimal solution obtained from the macroscopic model also demonstrated a clear performance improvement over the uniform lattice, with an average enhancement of 28.7% in the experimental results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Optimizing TPMS lattice distribution in heat exchangers using macroscopic modeling improves heat transfer by 28.7% compared to uniform lattice designs.", "motivation": "While TPMS lattice structures enhance heat transfer through uniform flow distribution and boundary layer disruption, uniform lattice configurations may not be optimal for macroscopic flow patterns.

The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $\u0394u^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "Three sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources in biharmonic wave equations using scattered field data, with varying requirements for measurements and computational efficiency.", "motivation": "To develop quantitative sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources in biharmonic wave equations using scattered field measurements, addressing limitations of existing methods that require derivative data or have computational inefficiencies.", "method": "Three indicator functions: 1) Uses only scattered fields on a single circle without derivative data, based on explicit source function formula; 2) Simplified double integral formula requiring \u0394u^s measurements for better efficiency; 3) Reconstructs source boundary from scattered fields at finite sensors using singularity analysis.", "result": "The methods achieve high-resolution imaging of source support or source function itself, with the second method outperforming the first in computational speed and reconstruction accuracy, and uniqueness established for annulus and polygon-shaped sources.", "conclusion": "The proposed sampling methods provide effective reconstruction of extended sources in biharmonic wave equations with varying measurement requirements, establishing connections between scattered fields and Radon transform of source functions for practical applications."}}
