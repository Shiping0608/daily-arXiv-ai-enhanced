Inputs are drawn from a prescribed probability measure on the input space, and outputs are (possibly noisy) evaluations of the target operator. We regard admissible operators as square-integrable maps with respect to a fixed approximation measure, and we measure reconstruction error in the corresponding Bochner norm. For a finite-dimensional approximation space $V$ of dimension $N$, we study weighted least squares estimators in $V$ and establish probabilistic stability and accuracy bounds in the Bochner norm. We show that there exist sampling measures and weights - defined via an operator-level Christoffel function - that yield uniformly well-conditioned Gram matrices and near-optimal sample complexity, with a number of training samples $M$ on the order of $N \\log N$. We complement the analysis by constructing explicit operator approximation spaces in cases of interest: rank-one linear operators that are dense in the class of bounded linear operators, and rank-one polynomial operators that are dense in the Bochner space under mild assumptions on the approximation measure. For both families we describe implementable procedures for sampling from the associated optimal measures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on several benchmark problems, including learning solution operators for the Poisson equation, viscous Burgers' equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations."}

Deconvolution of this data is an ill-posed problem and regularisation is required to provide feasible solutions. Deconvolution with regularisation is applied to a synthetic feed consisting of particles of constant density that vary in size only. It was found that the feed size distribution could be successfully deconvolved from the bag weights, with an accuracy that improved as the rate acceleration of the fluidisation rate was decreased. The deconvolution error only grew linearly with error in the measured bag masses. It was also shown that combining data from two different liquids can improve the accuracy."}

Designed as a drop-in replacement for the linear algebra routines in existing R-matrix codes, HPRMAT employs direct linear equation solving with optimized libraries instead of traditional matrix inversion, achieving significant performance improvements. The package provides four solver backends: (1) double-precision LU factorization, (2) mixed-precision arithmetic with iterative refinement, (3) a Woodbury formula approach exploiting the kinetic-coupling matrix structure, and (4) GPU acceleration. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that the GPU solver achieves up to 9$\\times$ speedup over optimized CPU direct solvers, and 18$\\times$ over legacy inversion-based codes, for large matrices ($N=25600$). The mixed-precision strategy is particularly effective on consumer GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090), where single-precision throughput exceeds double-precision by a factor of 64:1; by performing factorization in single precision with iterative refinement, HPRMAT overcomes the poor FP64 performance of consumer hardware while maintaining double-precision accuracy. This makes large-scale CDCC and coupled-channel calculations accessible to researchers using standard desktop workstations, without requiring expensive data-center GPUs. CPU-only solvers provide 5--7$\\times$ speedup through optimized libraries and algorithmic improvements. All solvers maintain physics accuracy with relative errors below $10^{-5}$ in cross-section calculations, validated against Descouvemont's reference code (Comput.\\ Phys.\\ Commun.\\ 200, 199--219 (2016)).

In this paper, we examine the underlying inverse problem in detail and construct explicit counterexamples demonstrating non-uniqueness for a recent implementation of x-ray eigenstrain tomography involving reconstruction from a single measured component of strain. We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components. We further prove two key results related to eigenstrain reconstruction in a general sense; 1. That any possible residual stress field can be generated by a diagonal eigenstrain and 2. That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains. Together, these findings establish rigorous minimum experimental and computational requirements for well-posed eigenstrain tomography techniques and inverse eigenstrain problems in general."}

Adopting an \"optimize-then-discretize\" strategy, we first apply a constraint-preserving continuous Riemannian gradient flow on an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, which is subsequently mapped to the neural network parameter space via Galerkin projection. This process naturally induces a Sobolev energy metric that incorporates physical information, effectively mitigating stiffness during optimization. To address the explicit dependence on the normalization constant caused by the nonlinear interaction term in the GPE, we design a hybrid sampling strategy combining an integration stream and a MCMC stream to achieve precise estimation of the generalized Gram matrix and energy gradients. Numerical experiments on benchmark cases, including the harmonic oscillator potential in the strong interaction limit and multi-scale optical lattice potentials, demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, it achieves an order-of-magnitude acceleration in convergence compared to standard optimizers like Adam, exhibiting superior robustness in handling strong nonlinearities and complex geometric constraints."}

Utilizing the Gyrokinetic Toroidal Code (GTC) and the QH-mode equilibrium, we perform linear and nonlinear simulations to analyze transport properties and instability dynamics under variations of $T_i$ and $T_e$. Our results demonstrate that decreasing $T_i/T_e$ leads to a relative destabilization of trapped electron modes (TEM) over ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, with the transition between these regimes dictated by $T_i/T_e$. When the electron temperature is increased at fixed ion temperature, we observe an increase in transport saturation levels. In contrast, decreasing the ion temperature at fixed electron temperature results in more modest transport enhancement. The radial correlation length, which characterizes eddy size, increases with rising $T_e$ and decreases with falling $T_i$, consistent with the observed trends in turbulent transport. Additionally, we examine the impact of impurity addition on turbulence and growth rates, finding that impurity presence does not significantly alter transport quantities compared to the impurity-free case. Finally, investigating helium as an alternative main ion species, we find that helium plasmas exhibit higher linear growth rates but result in lower transport saturation levels than deuterium plasmas, suggesting potential confinement benefits. These findings provide quantitative insights into the temperature ratio dependence in QH-mode plasmas and highlight the role of temperature profiles and zonal flows in influencing plasma confinement."}

However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions. This work offers a robust and generalizable approach to learning stiff spatiotemporal dynamics from limited data without explicit \\textit{a priori} knowledge of PDE terms."}

The main advantage of the moving grid is that the algorithm can deal well with cases where the domain boundaries are time-dependent and the simulation domain contains rigid objects. Due to the irregular nature of the grid, we use a novel meshless MUSCL-like Moving Least Squares Method (MLS) for spatial discretisation coupled with a higher-order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta method. To avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities, we use the so-called Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) method with an adapted criterion to relax the discrete maximum property. Finally, we employ a new implementation of the boundary conditions that requires no iterative or extrapolation procedure. The method achieves fourth-order in 1D and second-order in 2D for simulations with moving boundaries. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on classical test cases such as the driven square cavity, shear layer, and shock tube."}

The initial turbulent, periodic equilibrium state is obtained by solving a Vlasov-Poisson system for initially thermalized electrons, with the addition of an external electric field able to trigger undamped, high-amplitude electron acoustic waves (EAWs). Once the external field is turned off, resonant particles are trapped in a stationary two-hole phase-space configuration. This equilibrium scenario is perturbed by some large-scale density noise, leading to an electrostatic instability with the merging of vortices into a final one-hole state. Numerical runs investigate several features of this regime, focusing on the dependence of the instability trigger time and growth rate on the rate of short-range collisions and grid resolution. According to Landau theory for weakly inhomogeneous equilibria, we observe that the growth rate of the instability depends only on the slope of the distribution function in the resonant region. Conversely, the onset time of the instability is affected by the collisional rate, which is able to postpone the onset of the instability. Moreover, by extending the simulations to a long-time scale, we investigate the saturation stage of the instability, which can be analyzed through the Hermite spectral analysis. In collisionless simulations where grid effects are negligible, the Hermite spectrum follows a power law typical of a constant enstrophy flux scenario. Otherwise, if collisional effects become significant, a cutoff is observed at high Hermite modes, leading to a decaying trend."}

Existing molecular dynamics simulations of bubble formation in bubble chambers were conducted with non-scintillating target materials and therefore do not account for the energy transfer to photons or time-delayed releases that occur in atomic de-excitation. In this study, we use the HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics framework to simulate bubble formation in liquid argon, including photon creation, ionization, and direct nuclear recoils. A multi-stage bubble growth process similar to that reported in the literature was observed. When comparing simulated thresholds with and without scintillation effects, we found that scintillation raises the average energy required to form a bubble by a factor of 2.16. This is larger than the fraction of energy lost to photon creation, and demonstrates that energy stored in excited molecular states with lifetimes longer than the rapid growth phase of nucleation (~250 ps) does not contribute significantly to bubble formation. This conclusion was further supported by simulations showing increased bubble nucleation thresholds when the excited molecular state lifetimes were increased, even under identical thermodynamic conditions."}

This means that the distribution of agents appears in the Hamiltonian only in an integral over the whole spatial domain. For mean field games with a class of such Hamiltonians, we prove existence of solutions for the mean field games system of partial differential equations, allowing pseudomeasure data for the distribution of agents. Specifically, this allows the initial distribution of agents to be a sum of Dirac masses. The existence theorem requires a smallness condition on the size of the terminal data for the value function (or, alternatively, on the size of the Hamiltonian); no smallness condition on the size of the initial data or on the size of the time horizon is required. We also prove uniqueness and continuous dependence results under the same type of smallness conditions. We prove continuous dependence under two complementary hypotheses on the initial data: strong convergence of a sequence of pseudomeasures, and weak-$*$ convergence of a sequence of bounded measures."}

In this work, we propose WeldNet: Windowed Encoders for Learning Dynamics, a data-driven nonlinear model reduction framework to build a low-dimensional surrogate model for complex evolution systems. Given time-dependent training data, we split the time domain into multiple overlapping windows, within which nonlinear dimension reduction is performed by auto-encoders to capture latent codes. Once a low-dimensional representation of the data is learned, a propagator network is trained to capture the evolution of the latent codes in each window, and a transcoder is trained to connect the latent codes between adjacent windows. The proposed windowed decomposition significantly simplifies propagator training by breaking long-horizon dynamics into multiple short, manageable segments, while the transcoders ensure consistency across windows. In addition to the algorithmic framework, we develop a mathematical theory establishing the representation power of WeldNet under the manifold hypothesis, justifying the success of nonlinear model reduction via deep autoencoder-based architectures. Our numerical experiments on various differential equations indicate that WeldNet can capture nonlinear latent structures and their underlying dynamics, outperforming both traditional projection-based approaches and recently developed nonlinear model reduction methods."}

It is challenging to establish the inviscid limit over large time periods for the incompressible Euler equations under the influence of the weak dissipative mechanism generated by the friction force. We first prove the global stability of the equilibrium, in the sense that initial perturbations with appropriate Besov spatial regularity lead to global well-posedness and uniform regularity estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for strong solutions of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. In particular, we establish the optimal rates of convergence to equilibrium uniformly in Navier-Stokes. Then, we construct global solutions to the inhomogeneous Euler-Fokker-Planck equations via the vanishing viscosity limit. Furthermore, by capturing the dissipation arising from two-phase interactions, we rigorously justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the inviscid limit process, with a convergence rate that is in sharp contrast to that in the pure incompressible fluid case. To achieve this global convergence, novel ideas and new techniques are developed in the analysis and may be applied to other significant problems."}

We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments.

The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients."}

These stationary profiles connect the non-degenerate equilibrium point with the degenerate state at zero, they are monotone, and arrive to the degenerate state at a finite point. They are neither sharp nor smooth. The degeneracy of the diffusion precludes the application of standard techniques to locate the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave in the energy space $L^2$. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the spectrum, the analysis of singular sequences, a generalized convergence of operators technique and refined energy estimates. It is shown that the $L^2$-spectrum of the linearized operator around the front is real and with a spectral gap, that is, a positive distance between the imaginary axis and the rest of the spectrum, with the exception of the origin. Moreover, the origin is a simple isolated eigenvalue, associated to the derivative of the profile as eigenfunction (the translation eigenvalue). Finally, it is shown that the linearization generates an analytic semigroup that decays exponentially outside a one-dimensional eigenspace associated to the zero eigenvalue."}
