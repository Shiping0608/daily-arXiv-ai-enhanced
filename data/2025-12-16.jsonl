The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.\n  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation.

In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed. This study highlights the power of multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings in advancing physics-informed deep learning frameworks for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space."}

Keywords: elasticity, microstructure, incompatible, two-well problems, scaling laws", "summary": "In this article, we study scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data in settings where the wells and/or the boundary data are incompatible. Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $ε$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $ε^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $ε^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $ε^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting."}

The Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model is a simple representation of this entire flow. First, the skill of the KRoNUT in representing flows from a high resolution full-physics simulation of marine tropical convection is compared to various plume representations of convection. Then the KRoNUT is used to construct bulk descriptions of the dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under the influence of advection and diffusion (only). Cross sections of advective and diffusive tendencies show that while vertical advection of the vertical wind is the most important advective tendency in clouds, the horizontal component of the convective circulation and advection thereof plays a crucial role in the evolution of circulations in the absence of buoyancy. Strong curvature of the flow near the surface and near the updraft core results in locally strong diffusive tendencies that depend on scale. Cross sections of tendencies from the KRoNUT compare favourably to results from the simulation. Interacting circulations are shown to exhibit a wide range of dynamics with some cases of interactions leading to unique stability of geometric properties of otherwise evolving flows and some leading to geometric clustering of circulation centers."}

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation.

In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r < 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r > $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfvén Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($β$) of the simulations.

Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration."}

However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows."}

In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated.

However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy."}

The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm."}

When the diffusion, drift, or potential terms, as well as the initial or boundary conditions, are distributions rather than functions, classical and weak solution concepts become inadequate due to the ill-posedness of products involving distributions. To overcome this, we introduce a framework of very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and the theory of moderate nets. Existence of very weak solutions is established under minimal regularity assumptions. We further prove consistency with classical solutions when the data are smooth and demonstrate uniqueness via negligibility arguments. Finally, we present numerical computations that illustrate the robustness of the very weak solution framework in handling highly singular inputs, including delta-type potentials and distributional boundary traces."}

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions.

We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed.

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation.

The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle.

Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions."}

Simas"], "title": "Fractional and Integer Order Sobolev Spaces for Compact Metric Graphs", "categories": ["math.AP", "math.PR"], "comment": "41 pages", "summary": "Given a compact metric graph $Γ$ and the Laplacian $Δ_Γ$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(κ^2 - Δ_Γ)^{α/2}u=f$ on $Γ$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{α,p}(Γ)$ and $H^α(Γ)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into Hölder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(κ^2-Δ_Γ)$ and $(κ^2-\\nabla(a\\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs."}

Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement."}

We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework. Additionally, we present a geometric counterpart to our analytic framework using preference maps.

For such irregular coefficients, we prove that the law of the classical Dean--Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium, while for the porous medium type Dean--Kawasaki equation, the convergence occurs at a polynomial rate. Furthermore, we obtain a regularization by noise effect, showing that the polynomial convergence rate improves to an exponential one whenever the noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including the case of conservative multiplicative linear noise. Our approach relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space, achieved through a refined doubling of variables argument.
