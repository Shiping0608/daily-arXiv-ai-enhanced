  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous connection between discrete quantum models (tight-binding) and their continuum approximations, showing that fundamental spectral properties converge in the appropriate limit

Method: Analyze density of states for self-adjoint operators in tight-binding models with slowly-varying periodic potentials, prove convergence to continuum Mathieu-type equation using mathematical analysis techniques

### [2] [An unfitted divergence-free higher order finite element method for the Stokes problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12050)
*Michael Neilan,Maxim Olshanskii,Henry von Wahl*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Higher-order unfitted finite element method for Stokes equations producing strongly divergence-free velocity fields using isoparametric Scott-Vogelius elements with stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that yields strongly divergence-free velocity fields up to physical boundaries while handling complex geometries through unfitted meshes, addressing the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with weak boundary condition enforcement.

Method: Combines isoparametric Scott-Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on cut background mesh with stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for Dirichlet boundary conditions. Uses higher-order Lagrange multiplier space for stability and pressure robustness.

Result: Provides complete stability and convergence theory in 2D with optimal-order velocity convergence in H¹ and L² norms, optimal H¹-convergence and nearly optimal L²-convergence for post-processed pressure. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The method successfully achieves strongly divergence-free velocity fields on unfitted meshes with robust implementation, overcoming geometric approximation errors and maintaining pressure robustness through careful formulation and analysis.

Abstract: The paper develops and analyzes a higher-order unfitted finite element method for the incompressible Stokes equations, which yields a strongly divergence-free velocity field up to the physical boundary. The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.
  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation. The analysis demonstrates optimal-order velocity convergence in both the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms and establishes optimal $H^1$-convergence and nearly optimal $L^2$-convergence of a post-processed pressure. Numerical experiments illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.

*Morgan Görtz,Moritz Hauck,Axel Målqvist,Andreas Rupp,Lucia Swoboda*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Two-level additive domain decomposition method for efficient simulation of beam network materials, with applications to stationary elasticity and time-dependent wave propagation problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network models efficiently represent materials with complex 1D structures (fibers, porous media, vascular networks) but require efficient solvers for large linear systems in both stationary and time-dependent formulations.

Method: Proposes a two-level additive domain decomposition method to solve linear systems from stationary elastic deformation and time-dependent wave propagation (via implicit time discretization) in beam networks.

Result: Rigorous convergence analysis shows method's convergence rate depends on network connectivity and heterogeneity. Numerical simulations on commercial paperboard demonstrate efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The domain decomposition method provides an efficient, robust solver for network material simulations, enabling accurate mechanical property prediction with reduced computational cost compared to full 3D resolution.

Abstract: Network models are used as efficient representation of materials with complex, interconnected locally one-dimensional structures. They typically accurately capture the mechanical properties of a material, while substantially reducing computational cost by avoiding full three-dimensional resolution. Applications include the simulation of fiber-based materials, porous media, and biological systems such as vascular networks. This article focuses on two representative problems: a stationary formulation describing the elastic deformation of beam networks, and a time-dependent formulation modeling elastic wave propagation in such materials. We propose a two-level additive domain decomposition method to efficiently solve the linear system associated with the stationary problem, as well as the linear systems that arise at each time step of the time-dependent problem through implicit time discretization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the domain decomposition method when used as a preconditioner, quantifying the convergence rate with respect to network connectivity and heterogeneity. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the mechanical properties of commercial-grade paperboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard numerical methods for the Kepler problem often produce spurious precession in orbital trajectories over long times, failing to preserve the exact shape and orientation of orbits. This paper aims to develop a scheme that maintains all conserved quantities exactly.

Method: The scheme uses an adaptive time step derived from a constant angular increment, ensuring exact preservation of angular momentum, total energy, and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. This approach maintains orbital geometry precisely.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates high accuracy and long-term stability in numerical experiments, with orbital trajectories retaining their precise shape and orientation without spurious precession.

Conclusion: The developed numerical scheme successfully preserves all first integrals of the Kepler problem exactly, providing a stable and accurate method for long-term orbital simulations without the artifacts common in standard approaches.

Abstract: We develop a numerical scheme for the Kepler problem that preserves exactly all first integrals: angular momentum, total energy, and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. This property ensures that orbital trajectories retain their precise shape and orientation over long times, avoiding the spurious precession typical of many standard methods. The scheme uses an adaptive time step derived from a constant angular increment. Analytical considerations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm combines high accuracy with long-term stability.

In other words, it is a minimum of $Q_k$ bubbles enriched $P_k$ finite element. We enrich the $P_4$ and $P_5$ spaces by $9$ $Q_4$ and $11$ $Q_5$-bubble functions, respectively. For all $k\ge 6$, we enrich the $P_k$ spaces exactly by $12$ $Q_k$ bubble functions. We show the uni-solvence and quasi-optimality of the newly defined $C^1$-$Q_k$ serendipity elements.

### [7] [Local discontinuous Galerkin method for the integral fractional Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12200)
*Rubing Han,Shuonan Wu,Hao Zhou*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: LDG method for fractional Laplacian on bounded domains using mixed formulation with primal variable, gradient, and Riesz potential, with analysis of regularity and optimal error estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective numerical method for solving integral fractional Laplacian problems on bounded Lipschitz domains, addressing the challenges of nonlocal interactions and boundary singularities.

Method: Local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method based on three-field mixed formulation (primal variable, gradient, Riesz potential). Analysis includes weighted Hölder/Sobolev regularity study of Riesz potential. LDG schemes on quasi-uniform and graded meshes with stabilization for graded case.

Result: Established optimal a priori error estimates. Numerical experiments confirm theoretical results.

Conclusion: The LDG method successfully handles fractional Laplacian problems with proper treatment of boundary singularities through rigorous regularity analysis and appropriate mesh strategies.

Abstract: We develop and analyze a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for solving integral fractional Laplacian problems on bounded Lipschitz domains. The method is based on a three-field mixed formulation involving the primal variable, its gradient, and the corresponding Riesz potential, yielding a flux-based structure well suited for LDG discretizations while retaining the intrinsic nonlocal interaction. A key ingredient of our analysis is a rigorous study of the weighted Hölder and Sobolev regularity of the Riesz potential, which enables accurate characterization of boundary singularities. Guided by these regularity results, we propose LDG schemes on quasi-uniform and graded meshes, with additional stabilization in the graded case to reconcile the discrepancy between the discrete spaces for the Riesz potential and flux fields. Optimal a priori error estimates are established, and numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results.

### [8] [A boundary integral equation method for wave scattering in periodic structures via the Floquet-Bloch transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12414)
*Wangtao Lu,Kuanrong Shen,Ruming Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A boundary integral equation method using periodic Green's functions for acoustic wave scattering in locally perturbed periodic structures, with efficient algorithms for computing background Green's functions and spectrally accurate quadrature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses acoustic wave scattering in locally perturbed periodic structures where the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, requiring effective truncation techniques for high-accuracy numerical solvers since traditional methods struggle with non-quasi-periodic wavefields.

Method: Uses Green's function for background periodic structure to construct boundary integral equation on artificial curve enclosing perturbation as transparent boundary condition; develops efficient algorithms based on Floquet-Bloch transform to compute background Green's functions; implements spectrally accurate quadrature rules for BIE discretization; creates leap and pullback procedures to compute total wavefield throughout structure.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of new solver; method for non-quasi-periodic problem achieves time complexity comparable to single quasi-periodic problem, showing significant computational advantage.

Conclusion: The developed boundary integral equation approach with transparent boundary conditions provides an efficient and accurate solver for acoustic wave scattering in locally perturbed periodic structures, achieving computational performance comparable to simpler quasi-periodic problems while handling more complex non-quasi-periodic wavefields.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of an acoustic wave scattering in a locally perturbed periodic structure. As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem.

### [9] [Hierarchical Coarse Basis by Randomised SVD: the Helmholtz Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12538)
*Martin J. Gander,Yao-Lin Jiang,Hui Zhang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: New Schwarz method with hierarchical coarse correction for Helmholtz problems reduces coarse problem size using randomized SVD and hierarchical domain decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oscillatory waves require high degrees of freedom, making coarse problems in Schwarz methods too large and computationally expensive.

Method: Combines randomized SVD of interface iteration with hierarchical domain decomposition to create a hierarchical coarse problem that can be solved decoupled at each level.

Result: The proposed method creates a hierarchical coarse problem that can be solved efficiently in a decoupled manner at each hierarchical level.

Conclusion: New Schwarz method with hierarchical coarse correction effectively addresses the coarse problem size issue for Helmholtz problems while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The oscillatory waves require sufficient degrees of freedom to resolve. That restriction usually applies also to coarse problems for Schwarz methods. The resulting coarse problem is then too large. To address the issue, a new form of Schwarz methods with coarse correction is proposed for the Helmholtz problem. There are two components in the proposed form: randomised SVD of interface iteration, and hierarchical domain decomposition. The resulting coarse problem is hierarchical and can be solved in a decoupled way at each level of hierarchy.

### [10] [Kernel interpolation in Sobolev spaces of hybrid regularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12684)
*M. Griebel,H. Harbrecht*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Optimized sparse grids in kernel interpolation avoid logarithmic factors in dimension-dependent complexity estimates, preventing curse of dimensionality for Sobolev spaces with hybrid regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel interpolation in high dimensions suffers from the curse of dimensionality, even with sparse grids that typically introduce dimension-dependent logarithmic factors in complexity estimates.

Method: Using optimized sparse grids for kernel interpolation in tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, specifically targeting Sobolev spaces with hybrid regularity.

Result: The logarithmic factor in dimension-dependent complexity estimates can be avoided, making kernel interpolation complexity not suffer from the curse of dimensionality for these spaces.

Conclusion: Optimized sparse grids enable dimension-independent complexity for kernel interpolation in Sobolev spaces with hybrid regularity, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Kernel interpolation in tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces allows for the use of sparse grids to mitigate the curse of the dimension. Typically, besides the generic constant, only a dimension dependent power of a logarithm term enters here into complexity estimates. We show that optimized sparse grids can avoid this logarithmic factor when the interpolation error is measured with respect to Sobolev spaces of hybrid regularity. Consequently, in such a situation, the complexity of kernel interpolation does not suffer from the curse of dimension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop practical computational methods for solving second-order Mean Field Game (MFG) problems using the theoretically established infinite-dimensional Newton iteration approach, which offers quadratic convergence but needs effective numerical implementation.

Method: Develops two numerical discretization schemes: 1) a finite difference scheme, and 2) a semi-Lagrangian scheme, both designed to enable computational implementation of the infinite-dimensional Newton iterations for MFG systems.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate robustness, accuracy, and efficiency when tested on several benchmark problems. Comparative analysis shows advantages over existing approaches and highlights the potential of Newton-based solvers for MFG systems.

Conclusion: Newton-based solvers with appropriate numerical discretization (finite difference and semi-Lagrangian schemes) provide effective computational tools for solving second-order Mean Field Game problems, offering improved performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We address the numerical solution of second-order Mean Field Game problems through Newton iterations in infinite dimensions, introduced in [14], where quadratic convergence of the method was rigorously established. Building upon this theoretical framework, we develop new numerical discretization techniques, including both a finite difference and a semi-Lagrangian scheme, that enable an effective computational implementation of the infinite-dimensional iterations.
  The proposed methods are tested on several benchmark problems, and the resulting numerical experiments demonstrate their robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. A comparative analysis between the two schemes and existing approaches from the literature is also presented, highlighting the potential of Newton-based solvers for MFG systems.

### [12] [Fast capacity computation for maze-like configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12836)
*Harri Hakula,Oona Rainio,Matti Vuorinen*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper studies conformal capacity of maze-like condensers using high-order hp-FEM, comparing numerical results to quasihyperbolic length and perimeter estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal capacity is difficult to compute exactly, so researchers need simpler estimates using domain functionals. The paper focuses on maze-like structures to understand how estimates perform as structural parameters vary.

Method: Uses high-order hp-finite element method to compute capacity of maze-like condensers numerically, then compares results to estimates based on quasihyperbolic length and perimeter of the compact set.

Result: Quasihyperbolic estimates demonstrate desired asymptotic properties and superior computational efficiency compared to direct numerical computation, especially as maze walls approach the compact set.

Conclusion: Quasihyperbolic estimates provide reliable and efficient alternatives to direct numerical computation of conformal capacity for maze-like structures, with good asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: We study the conformal capacity ${\rm cap}(Ω,K)$ where $Ω$ is a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $K$ is a compact connected set in $Ω$. Because the exact numerical value of the capacity is known only in a handful of special cases, it is important to find estimates for the capacity in terms of domain functionals, simpler than the capacity itself. Here, we study condensers of maze-like structure and compute their capacity by means of a high-order $hp$- finite element method. We compare these numerical results to the estimates given by the quasihyperbolic length and perimeter of the compact set. In particular, we consider the behaviour of these value pairs, numerical results and estimates, when the structure parameters vary and the walls of the maze approach the compact set. Over the configurations covered in the numerical experiments, the quasihyperbolic estimates are shown to have the desired asymptotic properties and superior computational efficiencies once the case-specific analysis is completed.

### [13] [Sharp convergence bounds for sums of POD and SPOD weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13068)
*Zexin Pan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes convergence of sums with POD weights, establishes equivalence conditions for convergence, characterizes growth rates for specific weight families, and generalizes results to SPOD weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the convergence behavior of sums involving product and order dependent (POD) weights, which appear in high-dimensional numerical analysis and approximation theory, particularly in quasi-Monte Carlo methods and function spaces.

Method: Mathematical analysis using combinatorial and analytic techniques to establish convergence criteria and asymptotic growth rates for sums with POD weights, then extending the analysis to smoothness-driven POD (SPOD) weights.

Result: Proved that for nonnegative sequences, the sum converges for all m>0 if and only if the sum of Υ_j converges. For specific weights γ_v=(|v|!)^σ∏_{j∈v}j^{-ρ}, showed that log S_γ(m) grows asymptotically as m^{1/(ρ-σ)} when ρ>σ.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete characterization of convergence and growth behavior for sums with POD weights, with generalizations to SPOD weights, offering theoretical foundations for applications in high-dimensional approximation and integration.

Abstract: This work analyzes the convergence of sums of the form $S_{\boldsymbolγ}(m)=\sum_{v\subseteq \mathbb{N}}γ_v m^{|v|}$, where $γ_v$ are product and order dependent (POD) weights. We establish that for nonnegative sequence $\{Υ_j\mid j\in \mathbb{N}\}$, $$\sum_{v\subseteq \mathbb{N}} |v|! m^{|v|}\prod_{j\in v} Υ_j<\infty \text{ for } m>0 \text{ if and only if } \sum_{j=1}^\infty Υ_j<\infty.$$ We further characterize the growth of $S_{\boldsymbolγ}(m)$ when $γ_v=(|v|!)^σ\prod_{j\in v}j^{-ρ}$ and prove that $\log S_{\boldsymbolγ}(m)$ exhibits asymptotic order $m^{1/(ρ-σ)}$ when $ρ>σ$. All results are subsequently generalized to smoothness-driven product and order dependent (SPOD) weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand within-host HIV dynamics and how antiretroviral therapy affects viral load and CD4+ T cell populations over time.

Method: Three-component nonlinear ODE model for healthy CD4+ T cells, infected CD4+ T cells, and free virus. Two treatment extensions: (i) separate efficacy terms for Reverse Transcriptase and Protease inhibitors, (ii) single combined efficacy parameter. Equilibrium analysis with Jacobian matrices and local stability conditions. Numerical simulations using 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.

Result: Determined equilibrium points and stability conditions for each model. Numerical simulations illustrate how therapy strength and timing affect cell populations and viral load evolution, showing potential for sustained viral suppression.

Conclusion: The study provides mathematical framework for understanding HIV dynamics under treatment, demonstrating how therapy parameters influence transient behavior and long-term viral suppression outcomes.

Abstract: We study within-host HIV dynamics using a three--component nonlinear ordinary differential equation model for healthy CD4$^{+}$ T cells, infected CD4$^{+}$ T cells, and free virus. In addition to the baseline model without treatment, we consider two treatment extensions that incorporate antiretroviral therapy: (i) separate efficacy terms for Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors and Protease inhibitors acting on infection and virus production, and (ii) a simplified formulation using a single combined efficacy parameter. For each model we determine equilibrium points and apply linearization to obtain the Jacobian matrix and local stability conditions near equilibrium. We perform numerical simulations using the classical fourth--order Runge--Kutta method to illustrate the evolution of cell populations and viral load under different therapy levels and treatment start times, including continuous treatment scenarios. The simulations highlight how therapy strength and timing shape transient behavior and can lead to sustained viral suppression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler that can better explore stiff energy landscapes by leveraging q-deformed Hamiltonian dynamics from Wess's q-commutative spaces, addressing limitations of traditional HMC in challenging sampling scenarios.

Method: Builds upon Lagrangian mechanics on Wess's q-commutative spaces to derive q-deformed Hamiltonian dynamics, then develops a computationally tractable scheme to create the q-HMC sampler that satisfies detailed balance principle.

Result: Numerical experiments show q-HMC's efficacy in exploring distributions with explicit potential functions, particularly stiff energy landscapes. When applied to Bayesian posterior distributions of inverse problems with stiff potentials, q-HMC demonstrates advantages over traditional methods while maintaining identical computational implementation to HMC for functional reconstruction problems.

Conclusion: The proposed q-HMC method successfully extends Hamiltonian dynamics using q-deformation, providing an effective sampler for challenging distributions with stiff energy landscapes while maintaining computational tractability and detailed balance properties.

Abstract: Building upon Lagrangian mechanics on Wess's $q$-commutative spaces, we derive the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian dynamics as formulated by Lavagno et al. (2006). We then develop a computationally tractable scheme and propose a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler ($q$-HMC). The proposed $q$-HMC method is shown to satisfy the detailed balance principle. Numerical experiments on distributions with explicit potential functions demonstrate its efficacy, particularly in exploring stiff energy landscapes. This method is also applied to draw samples from the Bayesian posterior distribution of inverse problems. The numerical test for the posterior distribution with stiff potential further shows the advantage of $q$-HMC. And it yields the identical computational implementation process to that of HMC when used to deal with functional reconstruction problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric structure of tensor sets with fixed ranks (CP, multilinear, TT) and establish when these sets form smooth manifolds, enabling the development of efficient Riemannian optimization methods.

Method: Analyze sets of tensors with fixed CP, multilinear, and TT ranks, derive conditions for when their smooth parts form smooth homogeneous manifolds (particularly requiring sufficiently low rank for CP and TT), then use these homogeneous structures to construct Riemannian metrics.

Result: Established conditions for CP and TT rank tensor sets to be smooth homogeneous manifolds (essentially requiring sufficiently low rank), and derived Riemannian metrics with complete geodesics that are computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Tensor sets with fixed ranks can form smooth homogeneous manifolds under appropriate conditions, enabling the development of efficient Riemannian optimization algorithms with complete geodesics for tensor computations.

Abstract: We consider sets of fixed CP, multilinear, and TT rank tensors, and derive conditions for when (the smooth parts of) these sets are smooth homogeneous manifolds. For CP and TT ranks, the conditions are essentially that the rank is sufficiently low. These homogeneous structures are then used to derive Riemannian metrics whose geodesics are both complete and efficient to compute.

Conclusion: The GPU-optimized HDG framework with batched dense operations and architecture-aware preconditioners provides scalable, high-performance solutions for complex PDE problems, effectively leveraging modern GPU architectures while maintaining algorithmic efficiency.

Abstract: We present scalable iterative solvers and preconditioning strategies for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) discretizations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on graphics processing units (GPUs). The HDG method is implemented using GPU-tailored algorithms in which local element degrees of freedom are eliminated in parallel, and the globally condensed system is assembled directly on the device using dense-block operations. The global matrix is stored in a block format that reflects the natural HDG structure, enabling all iterative solver kernels to be executed with strided batched dense matrix-vector multiplications. This implementation avoids sparse data structures, increases arithmetic intensity, and sustains high memory throughput across a range of meshes and polynomial orders. The nonlinear solver combines Newton's method with preconditioned GMRES, integrating scalable preconditioners such as block-Jacobi, additive Schwarz domain decomposition, and polynomial smoothers. All preconditioners are implemented in batched form with architecture-aware optimizations--including dense linear algebra kernels, memory-coalesced vector operations, and shared-memory acceleration--to minimize memory traffic and maximize parallel occupancy. Comprehensive studies are conducted for a variety of PDEs (including Poisson equation, Burgers equation, linear and nonlinear elasticity, Euler equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) using structured and unstructured meshes with different element types and polynomial orders on both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures.

Abstract: Quasi-periodic trajectories with two or more incommensurate frequencies are ubiquitous in nonlinear dynamics, yet the classical Fourier-based time-spectral method is tied to strictly periodic responses. We introduce a torus time-spectral method that lifts the governing equations to an extended angular phase space, applies double-Fourier collocation on the invariant torus, and solves for the state. The formulation exhibits spectral convergence for quasi-periodic problem which we give a rigorous mathematical proof and also verify numerically. We demonstrate the approach on Duffing oscillators and a nonlinear Klein-Gordon system, documenting spectral error decay on the torus and tight agreement with time-accurate integrations while using modest frequency grids. The method extends naturally to higher-dimensional tori and offers a computationally efficient framework for analyzing quasi-periodic phenomena in fluid mechanics, plasma physics, celestial mechanics, and other domains where multi-frequency dynamics arise.

### [19] [The energy scaling behavior of a class of incompatible two-well problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12014)
*Noah Piemontese-Fischer*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with incompatible boundary conditions, showing different energy scaling exponents (ε^{4/5} vs ε^{2/3}) depending on whether wells differ by rank-one or rank-two matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand energy scaling behavior in geometrically linear two-well problems when wells and/or boundary data are incompatible, which is important for modeling phase transformations and microstructure formation in materials science.

Method: Uses an 𝒜-free framework for incompatible two-well problems to derive lower scaling bounds, and constructs branching patterns adapted to incompatible settings for upper bounds, with matching arguments to establish exact scaling exponents.

Result: For geometrically linear two-well problems in 2D: when boundary data enforces oscillations and ε is small, minimal energy scales as ε^{4/5} for rank-one matrix differences between wells, and as ε^{2/3} for rank-two matrix differences. Similar ε^{2/3}-scaling found for gradient and divergence-free two-well problems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes precise scaling laws for incompatible two-well energies, showing different exponents based on matrix rank differences between wells, with general 𝒜-free framework providing tools for analyzing such problems and branching constructions demonstrating optimal energy scaling.

Abstract: In this article, we study scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data in settings where the wells and/or the boundary data are incompatible. Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $ε$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $ε^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $ε^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $ε^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting.

TL;DR: Nonlinear PDE series expansions with infinite radius of convergence for Burgers' equation and applications to p-Laplacian models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop rigorous series expansion techniques for solving nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs by deforming them from linear counterparts, enabling systematic analysis beyond perturbative regimes

Method: Introduce auxiliary parameter δ that interpolates between linear and nonlinear PDEs; derive hierarchical system of linear forced PDEs; prove convergence properties for Burgers' equation; analyze Dirac-delta and periodic initial conditions; extend to p-Laplacian models with numerical validation

Result: Proved infinite radius of convergence for Burgers' equation series expansions; demonstrated convergence outside perturbative regime for p-Laplacian models; showed deformation choice affects convergence rate and radius; provided rigorous foundation for series techniques

Conclusion: Established rigorous framework for series expansion methods in nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, enabling new analytical approaches and potential applications in quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics

Abstract: We consider nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for advection-diffusion processes which are augmented by an auxiliary parameter $δ$ such that $δ=0$ corresponds to linear advection-diffusion. We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $δ$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics.

Motivation: To address the challenge that a priori energy estimates alone are insufficient for establishing local existence in free-boundary problems involving inviscid fluid equations due to loss of symmetry in linearized equations

Method: Develop an effective approximate system of equations that is asymptotically consistent with the free-boundary Lin-Liu model in Lagrangian coordinates, capturing coupling between fluid motion and harmonic heat flows, and boundary regularity

Result: Prove local well-posedness of the free-boundary Lin-Liu equations describing motion of inviscid nematic liquid crystals with surface tension

Conclusion: Successfully establish local existence for this free-boundary problem by developing an appropriate approximate system that handles the coupling between fluid dynamics and harmonic heat flows while maintaining boundary regularity

Abstract: In this article, we prove the local well-posedness of the free-boundary Lin-Liu equations describing the motion of inviscid nematic liquid crystals in the presence of surface tension in Lagrangian coordinates. It is well known that a priori energy estimates alone are insufficient for establishing local existence in free-boundary problems involving inviscid fluid equations, primarily due to the loss of symmetry in the linearized equations. The main challenge is to develop an effective approximate system of equations that is asymptotically consistent with the free-boundary Lin-Liu model expressed in the Lagrangian coordinates. This system must accurately capture the coupling between the fluid motion and the harmonic heat flows within the interior, as well as the regularity of the moving boundary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate the approximation of brittle fracture laws using increasingly steep cohesive zone models in the context of adhesive membrane debonding.

Method: Uses quasistatic energetic solutions to a rescaled cohesive debonding problem, with convergence analysis to brittle counterpart via free-boundary reformulation.

Result: Proves that solutions to cohesive debonding problems converge to limit evolutions solving the brittle debonding model as cohesive profiles become steeper.

Conclusion: The steep cohesive profile approximation provides a rigorous mathematical validation for bridging cohesive zone models to brittle fracture in adhesive debonding problems.

Abstract: The approximation of brittle laws via steeper and steeper cohesive profiles is validated within the mechanical setting of debonding models, which describe the detachment process of a peeled elastic adhesive membrane. In a quasistatic framework, energetic solutions to a suitably rescaled cohesive debonding problem, formulated in terms of displacements, are proved to converge to a limit evolution of shapes solving its brittle counterpart. The proposed approach relies on an equivalent and recently introduced free-boundary reformulation of this latter model.

Motivation: To establish uniform lower bounds for nodal volumes in elliptic homogenization problems, addressing the gap between existing results and optimal bounds, particularly focusing on two-dimensional cases.

Method: First proves a uniform lower bound for nodal volume in elliptic homogenization setting, then extends the approach to more general settings by considering continuous functions with strong maximum principle.

Result: Achieves a constant lower bound for nodal volume in dimension two, and extends this to general continuous functions with strong maximum principle, working beyond solutions to elliptic PDEs.

Conclusion: The proof technique for elliptic homogenization can be generalized to establish constant lower bounds for nodal volumes of continuous functions satisfying strong maximum principle, expanding applicability beyond elliptic PDE solutions.

Abstract: In this note, we first try to prove a uniform lower bound of nodal volume in elliptic homogenization setting. This lower bound is far from optimal. But, we can prove a constant lower bound in dimension two. Motivated by the proof, we extend this results to more general settings. To be more specific, we prove that the nodal volume has a constant lower bound for all continuous functions with strong maximum princple. Our result works for general functions beyond solutions to elliptic PDEs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand wave propagation phenomena in structural mechanics, particularly suspension bridge models, by analyzing traveling wave solutions for fourth-order semilinear wave equations (beam equations).

Method: Variational methods based on constrained maximization problems to establish existence of smooth traveling waves; spectral analysis of linearized operators; Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion; extension to fourth-order nonlinear Schrödinger equations; numerical verification.

Result: Existence of smooth, exponentially decaying traveling waves for wavespeeds in (0, √2); complete spectral stability characterization via VK criterion; sharp exponential decay rates matching Green's function decay; analogous results for fourth-order NLS; numerical confirmation of stability predictions and regime transitions.

Conclusion: Provides comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding wave propagation in structural mechanics, with complete existence and stability analysis of traveling waves for beam equations and fourth-order NLS, validated by numerical computations.

Abstract: We investigate the existence and spectral stability of traveling wave solutions for a class of fourth-order semilinear wave equations, commonly referred to as beam equations. Using variational methods based on a constrained maximization problem, we establish the existence of smooth, exponentially decaying traveling wave profiles for wavespeeds in the interval $(0, \sqrt{2})$. We derive precise spectral properties of the associated linearized operators and prove a Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion that completely characterizes spectral stability. Furthermore, we determine the sharp exponential decay rate of the traveling waves and demonstrate that it matches the decay rate of the Green's function for the linearized operator. Our analysis extends to fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equations, for which we establish analogous existence and stability results. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerical computations that verify the stability predictions and reveal the transition from unstable to stable regimes as the wavespeed varies. These results provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding wave propagation phenomena in structural mechanics, particularly suspension bridge models.

Motivation: To understand the dynamics of multiple vortex filaments in higher-dimensional Abelian Higgs models, particularly the poorly-understood phenomenon of vortex reconnection in 3D superconductors.

Method: Constructs solutions for N≥1 slowly-moving, nearly parallel vortex filaments in d≥3 dimensions, showing leading-order dynamics are described by wave maps from ℝ^{d-2} into the Abelian Higgs moduli space (parametrizing stationary 2D solutions).

Result: Establishes correspondence between critical hyperbolic AHM dynamics and wave maps into moduli space, and between critical AHM heat flow and harmonic map heat flow into moduli space, with parallel results for near-critical equations.

Conclusion: Provides rigorous framework for studying vortex filament dynamics and reconnection in 3D Abelian Higgs models by relating them to geometric flows on moduli spaces, enabling analysis of previously poorly-understood phenomena.

Abstract: We construct novel solutions in $d\ge 3$ space dimensions of a family of nonlinear evolutions equations that includes the critical hyperbolic Abelian Higgs model (AHM). For the AHM, these solutions exhibit an ensemble of $N\ge 1$ slowly-moving, nearly parallel vortex filaments, whose leading-order dynamics are described by a wave map from ${\mathbb R}^{d-2}$ into the Abelian Higgs moduli space, a manifold carrying a natural Riemannian structure that parametrizes stationary 2d solutions of the AHM. We also prove extremely similar results that relate the critical Abelian Higgs heat flow, modeling certain superconductors, to the harmonic map heat flow into the Moduli space, as well as some parallel results for near-critical equations. When $d=3$, these results allow for the study of the poorly-understood phenomenon of vortex reconnection in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study steady-state solutions of the relativistic Boltzmann equation in bounded domains, which is important for understanding particle transport in relativistic contexts like astrophysics and high-energy physics.

Method: Use weighted $L^1_p L^\infty_{x_1}$ framework with spatial symmetry in transverse variables, establish sharp coercivity/continuity estimates for collision frequency, weighted convolution bounds for nonlinear gain term, and leverage $(-\Delta_p)^{-1}$-type regularity.

Result: Prove existence and uniqueness of stationary solution with exponential momentum decay, uniform weighted integrability over arbitrary 2D hyperplanes through origin, without smallness assumption on slab width.

Conclusion: The paper establishes rigorous mathematical framework for steady relativistic Boltzmann solutions in bounded domains with hard-sphere interactions, providing important analytical tools for studying relativistic transport phenomena.

Abstract: We study steady solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation with hard-sphere interactions in a slab geometry. Under a spatial symmetry assumption in the transverse variables $x_2$ and $x_3$, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional spatial slab $x_1 \in [0,1]$ while retaining full three-dimensional momentum dependence. For non-negative inflow boundary conditions prescribed at $x_1=0$ and $x_1=1$, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary solution in a weighted $L^1_p L^\infty_{x_1}$ framework, together with exponential decay in momentum.
  Our analysis treats the full slab domain and does not rely on any smallness assumption on the slab width. We establish sharp coercivity and continuity estimates for the collision frequency, together with weighted convolution and pointwise bounds for the nonlinear gain term. These estimates generate and propagate a $(-Δ_p)^{-1}$-type regularity within the solution framework, which plays a crucial role in the existence and uniqueness argument. In addition, we obtain uniform weighted integrability of the solution over arbitrary two-dimensional hyperplanes through the origin. This hyperplane estimate is derived as a genuinely a posteriori regularity property, without imposing any a priori hyperplane bounds, and follows from a Lorentz-invariant geometric reduction.

Motivation: To study control properties of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a fundamental model in phase separation and pattern formation, with applications to materials science and fluid dynamics.

Method: 1. Geometric control theory for small-time global approximate controllability using Fourier mode controls. 2. Quantitative propagation of smallness estimates for linearized null controllability with localized spatial controls. 3. Fixed-point argument for local null controllability in dimensions 1-3. 4. Two-phase strategy combining Fourier and spatial localization.

Result: 1. Small-time global approximate controllability with Fourier mode controls. 2. Linearized null controllability with controls on arbitrary positive measure sets. 3. Local null controllability for nonlinear system in dimensions 1-3. 4. Global null controllability of Cahn-Hilliard equation via combined approach.

Conclusion: The Cahn-Hilliard equation is globally null controllable on the d-dimensional torus using a two-phase control strategy: first with Fourier-localized controls, then with spatially localized controls on positive measure sets.

Abstract: This paper deals with the global control properties of the Cahn-Hilliard equation posed on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We first prove that the system is small-time globally approximately controllable using a control supported on finitely many Fourier modes, following an approach based on geometric control theory techniques. Next, we show that the corresponding linearized problem is null-controllable with a localized control, where the control region is an arbitrary measurable set of positive Lebesgue measure. Our analysis is based on quantitative propagation of smallness estimates for the free solution. Furthermore, when $d\in \{1,2,3\},$ we ensure the local null controllability for the nonlinear system via a fixed-point argument. Finally, by combining these two results, we establish the global null controllability of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. In the first phase, the control is localized in Fourier modes, whereas in the second phase, it is spatially localized on a set of positive Lebesgue measure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical and weak solution concepts fail for parabolic equations when coefficients or boundary data are distributions, due to ill-posed products involving distributions.

Method: Introduce very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and theory of moderate nets, using negligibility arguments for uniqueness.

Result: Existence established under minimal regularity, consistency with classical solutions when data are smooth, and uniqueness via negligibility arguments.

Conclusion: Very weak solution framework robustly handles highly singular inputs including delta-type potentials and distributional boundary traces, as shown numerically.

Abstract: We investigate linear parabolic equations in divergence form with singular coefficients and non-smooth boundary data. When the diffusion, drift, or potential terms, as well as the initial or boundary conditions, are distributions rather than functions, classical and weak solution concepts become inadequate due to the ill-posedness of products involving distributions. To overcome this, we introduce a framework of very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and the theory of moderate nets. Existence of very weak solutions is established under minimal regularity assumptions. We further prove consistency with classical solutions when the data are smooth and demonstrate uniqueness via negligibility arguments. Finally, we present numerical computations that illustrate the robustness of the very weak solution framework in handling highly singular inputs, including delta-type potentials and distributional boundary traces.

Result: Provides a framework for obtaining global elliptic estimates from symbol-level hypoelliptic properties without pseudodifferential calculus, and proves that symmetric operators of hypoelliptic type on graded Lie groups are self-adjoint.

Conclusion: The approach offers a transparent and flexible alternative to pseudodifferential methods for hypoelliptic analysis on graded Lie groups, with applications to self-adjointness of symmetric hypoelliptic operators.

Abstract: On graded Lie groups, we develop a mechanism that transfers the uniformity of maximal hypoellipcity from the frozen coefficients principal part of a differential operator to the full operator. Our approach brings the century-old "freeze-unfreeze" strategy into the hypoelliptic setting, and offers a transparent and flexible framework for lifting symbol-level hypoelliptic properties to global elliptic estimates, without relying on pseudodifferential calculus. In addition, we prove that symmetric operators of hypoelliptic type on a graded Lie group are self-adjoint.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of limiting absorption principle for elliptic equations with periodic structures faces challenges in dimensions greater than 1 due to mismatch between directional physical reality and direction-independent classic spectral analysis.

Method: Introduces a new approach that incorporates direction into classic spectral analysis, allowing for semi-analytic formulation of solutions obtained through the limiting absorption principle.

Result: The new approach resolves the mathematics-physics mismatch, breaks dimensional barriers, provides explicit solution representations, and reflects physical phenomena accurately.

Conclusion: The directional spectral analysis approach opens doors for further possibilities in solution analysis and numerical simulations for elliptic equations with periodic structures.

Abstract: The study of the limiting absorption principle for elliptic equations with periodic structures is very challenging when the dimension is greater than 1. The fundamental reason for the dimensional barrier is the mismatch between directional physical reality and the direction-independent classic spectral analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new approach which introduce the direction into classic spectral analysis. With the new approach, the solution obtained by the limiting absorption principle can be formulated in a semi-analytic form, which not only gives an explicit representation of the solutions, but also reflects the phenomenon in physics.

It establishes conditions for consistency over long time intervals and proves existence of variational dual solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of base states in ensuring consistency of dual variational formulations for quadratic PDE systems, particularly for non-conservative systems like the noise-free Nash system with quadratic Hamiltonians and multiple players.

Method: The authors identify a sufficient condition for consistency over large time intervals, prove existence of variational dual solutions for arbitrary base states, and propose a Hilbertian gradient flow scheme that generates sequences of base states converging to PDE solutions.

Result: In the single-player case, there exists a sequence of fully consistent base states converging in mean to zero. The paper proves existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states.

Conclusion: Base states play a crucial role in dual variational formulations for quadratic PDE systems, with consistency achievable under certain conditions. The proposed Hilbertian gradient flow scheme offers a promising approach for generating solutions from arbitrary initial base states.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.

*Harbir Antil,Alex Kaltenbach,Keegan L. A. Kirk*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper studies optimal insulation distribution for a thermally conducting body with convective heat transfer, using Γ-convergence to analyze heat loss as insulation thickness approaches zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine the optimal distribution of insulating material on a thermally conducting body to minimize heat loss through convective heat transfer, which has practical applications in thermal engineering and energy efficiency.

Method: The authors use Γ-convergence in L²(ℝᵈ) to analyze the heat loss formulation as ε→0⁺, where ε represents insulation conductivity. They consider a bounded Lipschitz domain Ω with C¹,¹-regular or piece-wise flat insulated boundary Γ_I, modeling the insulation layer thickness via εd(x) where d is the material distribution function.

Result: The main result establishes Γ-convergence of the heat loss formulation as the insulation conductivity ε approaches zero, providing a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing optimal insulation distribution problems in the thin insulation limit.

Conclusion: The paper provides a mathematical foundation for studying optimal insulation distribution problems using Γ-convergence techniques, enabling analysis of heat loss minimization in the limit of thin insulating layers with convective boundary conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an insulation problem that seeks to determine the optimal distribution of a given amount $m>0$ of insulating material coating an insulated boundary part $Γ_I\subseteq \partialΩ$ of a thermally conducting body $Ω\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, subject to convective heat transfer. The `$\textit{thickness}$' of the insulating layer $Σ_{I}^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is given locally via $\varepsilon \mathtt{d}$, where $\varepsilon>0$ denotes the (arbitrarily small) conductivity and $\mathtt{d}\colon Γ_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. Then, the physical process is modelled by the stationary heat equation in the insulated thermally conducting body $Ω_{I}^{\varepsilon}:= Ω\cupΣ_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ with Robin-type boundary conditions on the interacting insulation boundary $Γ_I^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \partialΩ_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ (reflecting convective heat transfer between the thermally conducting body $Ω$ and its surrounding medium) as well as Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at the remaining boundary parts, $\textit{i.e.}$, $\partialΩ_{I}^{\varepsilon}\setminus Γ_I^{\varepsilon}$.
  More precisely, we establish $Γ(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the heat loss formulation (as ${\varepsilon \to 0^+}$), in the case that the thermally conducting body $Ω$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain having a $C^{1,1}$-regular or piece-wise flat insulated boundary $Γ_I$.

Motivation: To understand the statistical behavior of solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equations and establish measure-theoretic properties of Gaussian measures under Hamiltonian flows in infinite-dimensional settings.

Method: Uses physical-space energies from previous work combined with a new abstract quasi-invariance argument that integrates space-time estimates along the flow with probabilistic bounds on the measure's support.

Result: Shows Gaussian measures with inverse covariance ||u||_H^s^2 are quasi-invariant under the flow for s>2, and the Radon-Nikodym density belongs to every L^p space locally in space.

Conclusion: The paper establishes rigorous measure-theoretic properties for Gaussian measures under nonlinear Schrödinger flows, providing tools for statistical analysis of such PDEs in two dimensions.

Abstract: We study the transport of Gaussian measures under the flow of the 2-dimensional defocusing Schrödinger equation $i \partial_t u + Δu = |u|^{2k} u$ posed on $\mathbb T^2$. In particular, we show that the Gaussian measures with inverse covariance $\|u\|_{H^s}^2$, are quasi-invariant under the flow for $s>2$. Moreover, we show that the Radon-Nykodim density belongs to every $L^p$ space, locally in space. The proof relies on the physical-space energies introduced in [52], as well as a new abstract quasi-invariance argument that allows us to combine space-time estimates, along the flow with probabilistic bounds on the support of the measure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for learning distributed port-Hamiltonian systems (dpHs) using Gaussian processes, addressing the challenge of numerical complexity in modeling such systems.

Method: Combines partitioned finite element method (PFEM) with Gp-dpHs method using late lumping approach, discretizing functional hyperparameters independently from dpHs discretization, and models GP prior mean as quadratic form to focus on nonlinear parts.

Result: Demonstrates the method on a nonlinear one-dimensional wave equation with unknown physical parameters (tension and linear mass), showing reduced numerical complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines PFEM with GP learning for dpHs, enabling efficient modeling with reduced complexity and focusing on nonlinear system components.

Abstract: In order to learn distributed port-Hamiltonian systems (dpHs) using Gaussian processes (GPs), the partitioned finite element method (PFEM) is combined with the Gp-dpHs method. By following a late lumping approach, the discretization of the functional hyperparameters of the GP prior over the Hamiltonian functional is chosen independently from the discretization of the dpHs, thus reducing the numerical complexity of our method. We next model the mean of the GP prior of the Hamiltonian as a quadratic form, enabling the GP kernel to focus on the nonlinear part of a given dpHs. We illustrate our method on a nonlinear one dimensional wave equation with unknown physical parameters (tension and linear mass).

TL;DR: The paper studies semilinear equations on weighted Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, focusing on classification of positive solutions at Sobolev-critical exponent and proving rigidity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between existence of positive solutions to semilinear equations and geometric/topological properties of weighted Riemannian manifolds, particularly how solutions imply rigidity of the manifold and triviality of the weight function.

Method: Analyzes model semilinear equations on complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature. Uses geometric analysis techniques to classify positive solutions at Sobolev-critical exponent and prove rigidity theorems under various curvature conditions (finite vs infinite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature). Constructs counterexamples to demonstrate sharpness of conditions.

Result: 1) Classification of positive solutions at Sobolev-critical exponent shows existence implies manifold rigidity and weight triviality. 2) Results hold under non-negative finite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, and with additional conditions for infinite dimensional case. 3) Constructed non-trivial positive solution on weighted manifold with positive infinite dimensional curvature demonstrates sharpness. 4) Corresponding rigidity result for Liouville equation on weighted Riemannian surfaces. 5) Non-existence theorems for sub-critical nonlinearities and under volume growth conditions, ruling out positive solutions on shrinking gradient Ricci solitons.

Conclusion: The existence of positive solutions to semilinear equations at Sobolev-critical exponent imposes strong geometric constraints on weighted Riemannian manifolds, leading to rigidity results. The conditions are sharp, as demonstrated by counterexamples. The work establishes deep connections between analysis of PDEs and geometric properties of manifolds with Bakry-Émery curvature.

Abstract: We study model semilinear equations on complete and non-compact weighted Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature. Our main goal is to classify positive solutions of the equation at the Sobolev-critical exponent, and furthermore to prove that the existence of such solutions implies rigidity of the manifold and triviality of the weight.
  This is possible when the weighted manifold has non-negative finite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, and even under the weaker condition of non-negative infinite dimensional Bakry-Émery Ricci curvature, up to imposing some additional conditions in the latter case. To exhibit the sharpness of these additional conditions, we construct a non-trivial positive solution of the critical problem on a weighted manifold with positive infinite dimensional curvature.
  We also obtain a corresponding rigidity result for solutions of the Liouville equation on weighted Riemannian surfaces. Finally, we prove some non-existence theorems when the nonlinearity is sub-critical or simply under certain volume growth conditions. In particular, the latter rules out all positive solutions on shrinking gradient Ricci solitons.

Motivation: To understand the regularity of global conservative solutions for an integrable system exhibiting strong nonlinear phenomena like gradient blow-up and peakon interactions, and to establish Lipschitz continuity of the solution flow.

Method: Builds on Bressan and Chen's geometric framework for quasilinear second-order wave equations. Uses transformed Bressan-Constantin variables and introduces a Finsler norm on tangent vectors to construct a Lipschitz metric representing minimal energy transportation cost between solutions.

Result: Proves that solutions retain C^k regularity away from a finite number of piecewise C^{k-1} characteristic curves, and provides description of solution behavior near these curves. Constructs a Lipschitz metric that guarantees continuity of the solution flow.

Conclusion: The paper successfully analyzes regularity properties of the two-component Novikov equation and constructs a metric framework that ensures Lipschitz continuity of the solution flow, advancing understanding of integrable systems with strong nonlinear phenomena.

Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a two-component generalization of the Novikov equation with cubic nonlinearity -- an integrable system whose solutions may develop strong nonlinear phenomena such as gradient blow-up and interactions between peakon-like structures. Our study has two main objectives: first, to analyze the generic regularity of global conservative solutions; and second, to construct a new metric that guarantees the Lipschitz continuity of the flow. Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces new Sobolev spaces for metric graphs that respect the unique regularity structure of fractional elliptic PDEs, where even-order derivatives are continuous but odd-order derivatives can be discontinuous at vertices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Sobolev spaces fail to capture the distinctive regularity structure of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs on metric graphs, where even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices but odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This prevents direct application of classical functional analysis tools.

Method: The authors define new families of Sobolev spaces W^{α,p}(Γ) and H^α(Γ) tailored to metric graphs, respecting continuity constraints on even-order derivatives while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. They systematically study their properties including characterizations, embedding theorems, and compactness results.

Result: The paper establishes fundamental properties of the new Sobolev spaces, derives uniform bounds on eigenfunction supremum norms, and demonstrates these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing regularity of fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs on metric graphs. They characterize domains of fractional powers of Laplacians and improve regularity results to sharp counterparts.

Conclusion: The introduced Sobolev spaces are fundamental for analyzing fractional PDEs on metric graphs, extending all previously known characterizations, improving regularity results to sharp versions, and providing a framework for studying Gaussian free fields on metric graphs.

Abstract: Given a compact metric graph $Γ$ and the Laplacian $Δ_Γ$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(κ^2 - Δ_Γ)^{α/2}u=f$ on $Γ$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{α,p}(Γ)$ and $H^α(Γ)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into Hölder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(κ^2-Δ_Γ)$ and $(κ^2-\nabla(a\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully estimates diffusion parameters and other related quantities in heat equation models from single measurements, demonstrating practical utility and improved performance in real-world applications like soil science.

Abstract: A broad class of inverse problems deals with determining certain parameters, from measurement data, in models which are associated to certain partial differential equations. In this work we focus on the heat equation on a finite interval and we determine the dimensionless diffusion parameter from a single measurement. Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes upper and lower bounds for growth of solutions to axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl in ℝ³, proving optimal upper bound t² for radial moment and at least t/log t growth for certain initial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the growth behavior of solutions to the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl, particularly establishing optimal growth rates for the radial moment and L^p norms, which addresses conjectures about potential finite-time singularity formation.

Method: Analyzes axisymmetric Euler equations in ℝ³ without swirl, uses radial moment ∫ℝ³ rω^θdx as key quantity, establishes upper bounds via mathematical analysis techniques, and proves lower bounds for initial data with specific symmetry and sign conditions.

Result: Proves optimal upper bound t² for radial moment growth (matching Childress conjecture), shows at least t/log t growth for radial moment under certain conditions, establishes at least t^{1/4} growth for L^p norms in limsup sense for all 1≤p≤∞, and demonstrates vorticity escapes to infinity in time-integral sense.

Conclusion: This provides the first rigorous power-law L^p-norm growth results for smooth, compactly supported initial vorticity in ℝ³, confirming significant growth behavior in axisymmetric Euler equations and supporting theoretical understanding of potential singularity formation.

Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ without swirl, and establish several upper and lower bounds for the growth of solutions. On the one hand, we obtain an upper bound $t^2$ for the radial moment $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} rω^θdx$, which is the conjectured optimal rate by Childress (Phys. D 237(14-17):1921-1925, 2008). On the other hand, for all initial data satisfying certain symmetry and sign conditions, we prove that the radial moment grows at least like $t/\log t$ as time goes to infinity, and $\|ω(\cdot,t)\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)}$ exhibits at least $t^{1/4}$ growth in the limsup sense for all $1\leq p\leq \infty$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to establish power-law $L^p$-norm growth for smooth, compactly supported initial vorticity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For these initial data, we also show that nearly all vorticity must eventually escape to $r\to\infty$ in the time-integral sense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the behavior of evolution equations with fractional Schrödinger operators in the more general setting of Morrey spaces, which extend beyond classical Lebesgue spaces, and to understand how semigroup properties are affected by Morrey-scale potentials.

Method: Using semigroup theory in Morrey spaces, proving order preserving properties of the semigroup, establishing monotonicity with respect to Morrey potentials, and analyzing exponential growth/decay through precise estimates and conditions on potentials.

Result: Proved order preserving properties in Morrey scale, monotonicity with respect to Morrey potentials, precise exponential growth estimates, and showed that Arendt-Batty type condition is necessary for exponential decay, identifying a large class of dissipative potentials where it's also sufficient.

Conclusion: The paper establishes fundamental properties of fractional Schrödinger semigroups in Morrey spaces, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential decay and identifying classes of potentials that ensure dissipative behavior in this generalized functional setting.

Abstract: We consider evolution equation with fractional Schrödinger operators in Morrey spaces. We prove order preserving properties of the associated semigroup in Morrey scale. We prove monotonicity of the semigroup with respect to Morrey's potentials and give some precise estimates of its exponential growth. We show that Arendt and Batty's type condition on the potential is necessary for exponential decay of Morrey's norms of the semigroup and find a large class of dissipative potentials for which it is also sufficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study nonlocal conservation laws with nonlinear mobility, which differ from linear mobility cases where shocks may form even with smooth kernels. Address the need for existence/uniqueness results under weak kernel assumptions in multiple dimensions.

Method: Vanishing viscosity method to construct entropy solutions. Assumes kernels are bounded and have finite total variation. Provides convergence rate for the approximation scheme.

Result: Establishes local-in-time existence and uniqueness for solutions. Shows solutions may develop shocks in finite time even with smooth kernels (unlike linear mobility case). Provides convergence rate for vanishing viscosity approximation.

Conclusion: Nonlocal conservation laws with nonlinear mobility exhibit different shock formation behavior than linear cases. The vanishing viscosity method successfully constructs entropy solutions with quantified convergence rates under weak kernel assumptions.

Abstract: We establish local-in-time existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal conservation laws with a nonlinear mobility, in several space dimensions, under weak assumptions on the kernel, which is assumed to be bounded and of finite total variation. Contrary to the linear mobility case, solutions may develop shocks in finite time, even when the kernel is smooth. We construct entropy solutions via a vanishing viscosity method, and provide a rate of convergence for this approximation scheme.

### [56] [Exponential Absolute Minimizing extension and biased infinity Laplacian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13664)
*Yang Chu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces β-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension (β-AM) on length spaces, generalizing classical absolute minimizing Lipschitz extensions to include a bias term β. This corresponds to biased infinity Laplacian equations and arises from biased tug-of-war games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the theory of absolute minimizing Lipschitz extensions and infinity Laplacian equations to include a bias parameter β, creating a more general framework that includes classical results as special cases (when β=0).

Method: Introduces β-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension (β-AM) on arbitrary length spaces using exponential slope functional L^β_u(E). Defines Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension and β-biased convexity as equivalent characterizations. Shows connection to biased tug-of-war games and studies properties of these extensions.

Result: Establishes that β-AM generalizes classical absolute minimizing Lipschitz extensions, corresponds to viscosity solutions of Δ^β_∞ u = 0 (biased infinity Laplacian), arises as continuum limit of biased tug-of-war games, and satisfies linear blow-up property for biased infinity harmonic functions.

Conclusion: The β-AM framework provides a natural generalization of absolute minimizing Lipschitz extensions that incorporates bias, connects to biased infinity Laplacian equations and tug-of-war games, and preserves key properties while extending the theory to more general settings.

Abstract: We study the variational structure of the biased infinity Laplacian by introducing a notion of the $β$\textit{-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension} ($β$--AM) on arbitrary length space, which absolutely minimizing the exponential slope
  $$ L^β_u (E) := β\sup_{x,y \in E} \frac{u(y) - e^{-β|x-y|} u(x)}{1- e^{-β|x-y|}}. $$We also define the corresponding Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension, and $β$-biased convexity, which equivalently characterize $β$-AM and may be of independent interest. These generalize the classical Absolute Minimizing Lipschitz Extension as a special case when $β= 0$. In Euclidean space with Euclidean norm, this corresponds to the Aronsson equation with Hamiltonian \[ H(u, \nabla u) = |\nabla u| + βu, \] equivalently viscosity solutions of $Δ_{\infty}^β u = 0$. We show that $β$-AM arises as the continuum value of a biased tug-of-war game. Analogous to the unbiased case, we derive various properties of this extension. As an application, we further show that the linear blow-up property holds for biased infinity harmonic functions.

TL;DR: Proposed HWF-PIKAN: a multi-resolution hybrid wavelet-Fourier-enhanced physics-informed KAN for solving advection problems and collisionless Boltzmann equations with improved accuracy and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-informed KANs (PIKANs) show promise for solving PDEs without extensive labeled data, but need enhancement for handling both continuous and discontinuous features in advection problems and high-dimensional phase-space settings.

Method: Developed a hybrid wavelet-Fourier-enhanced PIKAN (HWF-PIKAN) that combines multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings. Applied to advection equations in 1D/2D and extended to high-dimensional phase-space for solving collisionless Boltzmann equation using Hamiltonian phase-space dynamics.

Result: HWF-PIKAN accurately captures both smooth and abrupt features in advection problems. Outperforms vanilla PINN, vanilla PIKAN, and single-modality Fourier/wavelet-enhanced variants in solution accuracy and convergence speed for complex kinetic equations.

Conclusion: Multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings significantly advance physics-informed deep learning for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space domains, demonstrating the power of hybrid wavelet-Fourier enhancements in PIKAN frameworks.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more recently Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) have emerged as promising approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without reliance on extensive labeled data. In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed. This study highlights the power of multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings in advancing physics-informed deep learning frameworks for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space.

*Anton Kananovich,Parth Mehrotra,Surabhi Jaiswal*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Random errors in kinetic temperature measurements from particle tracking velocimetry due to position uncertainty, with spatial resolution being more critical than frame rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how position uncertainty in particle tracking velocimetry affects kinetic temperature measurements, particularly the relative importance of spatial resolution versus frame rate.

Method: Used simulated data with particles following Maxwellian distribution at known temperature. Particle positions were randomly assigned and roughened to match prescribed spatial resolution. Velocities were restored using two-frame tracking method, and kinetic temperature was calculated. Procedure repeated to obtain discrepancy as function of spatial resolution and frame rate.

Result: Under typical experimental conditions, restored kinetic temperature can deviate significantly from true value, with spatial resolution playing a more dominant role than frame rate in causing measurement errors.

Conclusion: Position uncertainty in particle tracking velocimetry introduces significant errors in kinetic temperature measurements, with spatial resolution being the primary factor affecting accuracy rather than frame rate.

Abstract: We report on random errors in kinetic temperature measurements due to position uncertainty in particle tracking velocimetry. Using simulated data, we isolate the effects of spatial resolution and the frame rate on particle velocity calculations. A sample of particle velocities is generated from a Maxwellian distribution at a known temperature. Particle positions are assigned randomly and roughened to match a prescribed spatial resolution. Velocities are restored using the two-frame tracking method, and the kinetic temperature is calculated. By repeating this procedure, we obtain the discrepancy as a function of the spatial resolution and frame rate. Results show that, under typical experimental conditions, the restored kinetic temperature can deviate significantly from the true value, with spatial resolution playing a more dominant role than the frame rate.

*F. Sattin. L. Martinelli*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Charged particles in perpendicular electrostatic waves below stochastic threshold can still gain energy through non-adiabatic dynamics, not just through stochastic heating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on stochastic heating above threshold potential, but sub-threshold dynamics were overlooked despite periodic oscillations always occurring.

Method: Analytical and numerical analysis of charged particle dynamics in perpendicular electrostatic waves with frequency above cyclotron frequency.

Result: Particle motion is non-adiabatic - particles don't return to initial state when wave is slowly turned off, enabling energy gain even below stochastic threshold.

Conclusion: Sub-threshold electrostatic waves can energize particles through non-adiabatic dynamics, expanding understanding of particle heating mechanisms in magnetized plasmas.

Abstract: The system made by a charged particle interacting with a single electrostatic wave which propagates perpendicularly to the magnetic field, at a frequency larger than the cyclotron one, has been extensively studied in literature due to its implications with ion heating in magnetized plasmas. It is known that a threshold in the electrostatic potential must be exceeded in order for stochastic particle motion and heating to occur. Regardless its amplitude, however, the electrostatic wave induces a periodic oscillation in the particle motion. We show, by analytical and numerical arguments, that this dynamics is non-adiabatic, meaning that the particle does not land back to its initial state when the wave is slowly turned off. This way, particle energization (although, not rigorously heating) occurs even under sub-threshold conditions.

TL;DR: Large-deviation analysis of minimum spanning tree weight distributions for complete graphs and connected Erdős-Rényi random graphs, revealing distribution changes at percolation threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical properties and extreme-value behavior of minimum spanning trees in random graph ensembles, particularly how their weight distributions behave in the large-deviation regime and whether they follow the large deviation principle.

Method: Used large-deviation Markov chain sampling to obtain distribution P(W) of spanning-tree weight W down to extremely small probability densities (10^{-300}). Studied two ensembles: complete graphs and Erdős-Rényi random graphs with edge probability p=c/N conditioned to be connected.

Result: For complete graphs, confirmed analytical predictions for expectation values. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For connected ER graphs, observed a remarkable change in distributions at c=1, which corresponds to the percolation threshold of the original ER ensemble.

Conclusion: Minimum spanning tree weight distributions exhibit large deviation behavior that follows the large deviation principle, with ER graphs showing a phase transition-like change at the percolation threshold, revealing connections between spanning tree properties and graph connectivity transitions.

Abstract: We study the large-deviation properties of minimum spanning trees for two ensembles of random graphs with $N$ nodes. First, we consider complete graphs. Second, we study Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs with edge probability $p=c/N$ conditioned to be connected. By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble.

### [63] [Irregular Stanley sequences plausibly do not have growth $Θ(n^2/\log n)$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11983)
*Nat Sothanaphan*

Main category: math.NT

TL;DR: Numerical evidence challenges the conjectured Θ(n²/log n) growth rate for Stanley sequences starting from {0,4}, suggesting instead O(n²/log n) upper bound but Ω(n^{2-δ}) lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the long-standing conjecture about Stanley sequences starting from {0,n}, which are hypothesized to have either regular (Θ(n^{log₂(3)})) or irregular (Θ(n²/log n)) growth rates. The n=4 case has been considered a paradigmatic candidate for irregular type, but no n has been proven to have such growth rate.

Method: The paper uses numerical methods to analyze the growth rate of Stanley sequences starting from {0,4}. The authors provide strong numerical evidence against the conjectured Θ(n²/log n) growth rate for this specific case.

Result: Numerical evidence suggests that for n=4, the upper bound might be O(n²/log n) but the lower bound appears to be Ω(n^{2-δ}) for some δ>0, contradicting the conjectured Θ(n²/log n) growth rate. This indicates the sequence is not as "random" as previously assumed.

Conclusion: The conjectured Θ(n²/log n) growth rate for Stanley sequences starting from {0,4} is likely incorrect. The actual growth appears to have different upper and lower bounds, suggesting the sequence exhibits more structure than previously thought. The paper also discusses limitations of the numerical approach used.

Abstract: Stanley sequences starting from the set $\{0, n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer have long been conjectured to be divided into two types: the "regular" type where the growth rate is $Θ(n^{\log_2(3)})$, and the "irregular" type where the growth rate is thought to be $Θ(n^2/\log n)$. A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $Ω(n^{2-δ})$ for some $δ> 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally "random" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the "switchbacks" (sudden magnetic field reversals) observed by Parker Solar Probe in the solar wind, which appear as one-dimensional profiles but likely originate from three-dimensional magnetic field structures.

Method: Developed a solitary Alfvén wave model with nontrivial 3D twisting of open magnetic field lines while maintaining constant magnetic field magnitude. The model uses embedded rotational discontinuities to sharply deflect otherwise uniform field lines.

Result: The model produces localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the switchbacks observed by Parker Solar Probe. This shows that switchbacks in spacecraft time series arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.

Conclusion: Switchbacks observed in one-dimensional spacecraft data are manifestations of three-dimensional magnetic field line curvature, specifically from traversals through sharply curved segments of open magnetic field lines in the inner heliosphere.

Abstract: We present a solitary Alfvén wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: 3D particle-in-cell simulations reveal turbulence statistics in collisionless magnetic reconnection: velocity fluctuations show Kolmogorov-like scaling (~1/3), magnetic fluctuations are steeper (~0.6-0.8), with guide fields increasing magnetic intermittency and local anisotropies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite magnetic reconnection's fundamental importance in converting magnetic energy to plasma energy, the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection remain poorly understood, hindering our understanding of energy conversion processes.

Method: Used large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate turbulence characteristics in magnetically dominated plasmas. Computed structure functions along different directions (inflow, outflow, guide-field) within the reconnection layer to characterize statistical properties.

Result: Velocity fluctuations show Kolmogorov-like power-law scaling (~1/3 slope) across all directions. Magnetic fluctuations exhibit steeper slopes (~0.6-0.8). Guide fields don't affect velocity scaling but steepen magnetic scaling in guide-field and inflow directions. Strong magnetic intermittency found along outflow direction, with increased local anisotropies for stronger guide fields.

Conclusion: This study provides the first systematic characterization of multiscale turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, revealing distinct statistical properties for velocity and magnetic fluctuations, with important implications for understanding plasma heating and particle acceleration mechanisms.

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that converts magnetic energy into bulk flow energy, thermal energy, and nonthermal particle acceleration. Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.

*Marcelo Bongarti,Michael Hintermüller*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper addresses existence of generalized Nash equilibria in Banach spaces, replacing the standard lower semicontinuity assumption with graph convexity or KKM properties, which are easier to verify in PDE-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard assumption of lower semicontinuity for constraint maps in GNEPs is difficult to verify in function spaces and PDE-constrained settings, even in convex cases. There's a need for alternative, more verifiable conditions that can ensure equilibrium existence.

Method: The authors replace lower semicontinuity requirements with graph convexity or Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) properties for constraint maps. They develop an analytic framework using these alternative conditions and extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces via multiplier bias. They also present a complementary geometric approach using preference maps.

Result: The paper shows that equilibrium existence can be established without lower semicontinuity by using graph convexity or KKM properties instead. These alternative conditions are often easier to verify in practical applications, particularly in function spaces and PDE-constrained problems. The results unify existing existence theorems and clarify the structural role of constraint maps.

Conclusion: The paper provides more practical conditions for equilibrium existence in GNEPs in Banach spaces, particularly valuable for applications in optimal control and PDE-constrained settings where verifying lower semicontinuity is challenging. The approach offers a unified framework that simplifies verification while maintaining theoretical rigor.

Abstract: A generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in Banach space consists of $N>1$ optimal control problems with couplings in both the objective functions and, most importantly, in the feasible sets. We address the existence of equilibria for convex GNEPs in Banach space. We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework. Additionally, we present a geometric counterpart to our analytic framework using preference maps. This geometric is intended as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the analytic theory developed in the main body of the paper.

Abstract: We consider a bilinear optimal control problem with pointwise tracking for a semilinear elliptic PDE in two and three dimensions. The control variable enters the PDE as a (reaction) coefficient and the cost functional contains point evaluations of the state variable. These point evaluations lead to an adjoint problem with a linear combination of Dirac measures as a forcing term. In Lipschitz domains, we derive the existence of optimal solutions and analyze first and necessary and sufficient second order optimality conditions. We also prove that every locally optimal control $\bar u$ belongs to $H^1(Ω)$. Finally, assuming that the domain $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a convex polygon, we prove that $\bar u \in C^{0,1}(\bar Ω)$.

### [68] [Local controllability in finite time and the controllable time of the Korteweg-De Vries equation using the right Neumann controls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13066)
*Hoai-Minh Nguyen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proves that the KdV equation with right Neumann boundary controls is not locally null-controllable in small time for critical lengths where the linearized system's unreachable subspace has dimension ≥2, extending previous results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the local boundary controllability of the KdV equation at critical lengths, extending previous work by Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen who established non-controllability for only a subclass of these lengths.

Method: Analysis of the KdV system with right Neumann boundary controls, focusing on the unreachable subspace of the linearized system at critical lengths where controllability issues arise.

Result: 1) KdV is not locally null-controllable in small time for all critical lengths where the unreachable subspace has dimension ≥2. 2) A new controllability time is obtained for all but two critical lengths, updating results from Cerpa (2007) and Cerpa-Crepeau (2009).

Conclusion: The work extends previous non-controllability results to all critical lengths with sufficient unreachable subspace dimension and provides updated controllability times, advancing understanding of KdV boundary control limitations.

Abstract: We investigate the local boundary controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with right Neumann boundary controls at critical lengths. We show that the KdV system is not locally null-controllable in small time for all critical lengths for which the unreachable subspace of the linearized system has dimension at least two. This result extends the work of Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen, who established it for a subclass of these lengths. We also obtain a new controllability time for such systems for all but two critical lengths. It is worth noting that the latest results on the controllability time prior to this work date back to the work of Cerpa (2007) and Cerpa and Crepeau (2009).

TL;DR: A randomized algorithm with polynomial runtime for computing log-partition functions of weakly interacting fermions, using importance sampling with belief propagation instead of traditional MCMC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for methods like diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, there has been no mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime for these computations.

Method: Extends cumulant expansion proof techniques from periodic to non-periodic systems, uses tree-determinant expansion to reveal underlying tree structure in Feynman diagrams, and designs a randomized algorithm combining importance sampling with belief propagation.

Result: Develops a new algorithm with provable polynomial runtime in both system size and precision, overcoming limitations of traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods whose efficiency is hard to guarantee.

Conclusion: The approach provides a mathematically rigorous polynomial-time algorithm for computing log-partition functions of weakly interacting fermions, offering guaranteed efficiency where previous methods lacked provable runtime bounds.

Abstract: We propose a randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function of weakly interacting fermions with polynomial runtime in both the system size and precision. Although weakly interacting fermionic systems are considered tractable for many computational methods such as the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo, a mathematically rigorous proof of polynomial runtime has been lacking. In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing's potential for improving simulations of interacting quantum particles by developing a reusable universal functional that can be applied across multiple systems without additional quantum resources.

Method: Uses deep neural networks trained with quantum algorithms to obtain the universal functional, and employs fragment-bath systems from density matrix embedding theory to expand the space of applicable Hamiltonians.

Result: Demonstrates a way to potentially achieve cumulative quantum advantage in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics applications by creating reusable universal functionals.

Conclusion: The approach enables reusable universal functionals that can be applied to any system with identical fragment interactions, offering a pathway to cumulative quantum advantage in quantum simulations.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach that exploits the intersection of quantum computing, machine learning and reduced density matrix functional theory to leverage the potential of quantum computing to improve simulations of interacting quantum particles. Our method focuses on obtaining the universal functional using a deep neural network trained with quantum algorithms. We also use fragment-bath systems defined by density matrix embedding theory to strengthen our approach by substantially expanding the space of Hamiltonians for which the obtained functional can be applied without the need for additional quantum resources. Given the fact that once obtained, the same universal functional can be reused for any system where the interactions within the embedded fragment are identical, our work demonstrates a way to potentially achieve a cumulative quantum advantage within quantum computing applications for quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics.

*Yizhong Chen,Zhibin Wang*

TL;DR: Proposes a corrected open boundary framework for immiscible pseudopotential LBM with MRT to address spurious currents and boundary stability issues in multi-component immiscible fluid systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for dynamic multi-component systems with open boundaries face challenges with spurious currents affecting interface formation/breakup and boundary configuration effects on simulation stability.

Method: Three key improvements: 1) Correction coefficients to reconstruct distribution function for accurate macroscopic quantity recovery at inlet; 2) Outlet velocity adjustment based on real-time mass flow rates to ensure global mass conservation; 3) Relaxation coefficient adjustment based on two-phase fluid viscosity to reduce spurious currents.

Result: Validated through four benchmark cases: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, droplet migration in microchannels, and droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.

Conclusion: The proposed corrected open boundary framework based on MRT for immiscible pseudopotential model successfully addresses boundary stability issues and spurious currents, enabling reliable simulation of dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems with open boundaries.

Abstract: The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.

### [73] [Ergodicity for the Dean--Kawasaki Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions: Taming the Square-Root](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12861)
*Shyam Popat,Zhengyan Wu*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Establishes ergodicity for generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions, accommodating irregular square-root type noise coefficients. Shows exponential convergence for classical equations and polynomial convergence for porous medium type, with regularization by noise effect improving polynomial to exponential convergence for regular coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous ergodicity results (Fehrman, Gess, Gvalani) didn't accommodate irregular, square-root type noise coefficients. This paper aims to extend ergodicity analysis to handle such irregular coefficients in Dean-Kawasaki equations with correlated noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Method: Relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space using a refined doubling of variables argument. The weight function construction crucially exploits the specific structure of the Dean-Kawasaki-type correlated noise.

Result: 1) For irregular coefficients, classical Dean-Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium. 2) Porous medium type Dean-Kawasaki equation converges at polynomial rate. 3) Regularization by noise effect: polynomial convergence improves to exponential when noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including conservative multiplicative linear noise case.

Conclusion: Successfully establishes ergodicity for generalized Dean-Kawasaki equations with irregular noise coefficients, demonstrating different convergence rates based on equation type and noise regularity, with a novel supercontraction approach in weighted spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the ergodicity of generalized Dean--Kawasaki equations with correlated noise and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In contrast to the ergodicity results of Fehrman, Gess, and Gvalani arXiv:2206.14789, our analysis accommodates irregular, square-root type noise coefficients. For such irregular coefficients, we prove that the law of the classical Dean--Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium, while for the porous medium type Dean--Kawasaki equation, the convergence occurs at a polynomial rate. Furthermore, we obtain a regularization by noise effect, showing that the polynomial convergence rate improves to an exponential one whenever the noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including the case of conservative multiplicative linear noise. Our approach relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space, achieved through a refined doubling of variables argument. The construction of the weight function crucially exploits the specific structure of the Dean--Kawasaki-type correlated noise.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper establishes sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for symmetric Markov jump processes with boundary-decaying jump kernels in bounded smooth domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the heat kernel behavior of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes with jump kernels that decay at the boundary, which is important for studying boundary effects in jump processes and their probabilistic properties.

Method: Study two types of processes: conservative processes and processes killed at boundaries or by killing potentials. Analyze jump kernels of form J(x,y)=B(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-α} where B decays at boundary and is described by O-regularly varying and slowly varying functions.

Result: Establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernel: in Lipschitz sets for conservative processes, and in C^{1,1} open sets for killed processes, under conditions on B and killing potential κ.

Conclusion: The paper provides precise heat kernel estimates for symmetric Markov jump processes with boundary-decaying jump kernels, extending understanding of boundary effects in discontinuous processes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes $X$ in bounded smooth subsets of $\mathbb R^d$: conservative processes and processes killed either upon approaching the boundary of the set or by a killing potential $κ$. The jump kernel of $X$ is of the form $J(x,y)={\cal B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-α}$, $α\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\cal B}(x,y)$ decays to 0 at the boundary and is described in terms of two $O$-regularly varying functions and one slowly varying function. Under the conditions, introduced in \cite{CKSV24}, on ${\cal B}(x,y)$ and on the killing potential $κ$, we establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernel of $X$: in Lipschitz sets when $X$ is conservative, and in $C^{1,1}$ open sets for the killed process.

TL;DR: ML-based neuroevolution potentials combined with anharmonic lattice dynamics and Boltzmann transport equation enable quantitative thermal transport analysis in carbon nanotube bundles, revealing dual suppression mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements of thermal transport in nanoscale materials, specifically single-walled carbon nanotubes and their bundles, by developing a predictive framework.

Method: Combines machine learning-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE), incorporating quantum Bose-Einstein statistics for accurate phonon scattering calculations.

Result: Reveals dual mechanism for thermal conductivity suppression in bundles: 1) breaking of rotational symmetry enhances scattering of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes (like twist mode), 2) emergence of inter-tube phonon modes creates additional scattering channels across frequencies. Approach quantitatively reproduces experimental observations.

Conclusion: Establishes ML-driven interatomic potentials combined with ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging theory-experiment gap and enabling quantitative, mode-resolved analysis.

Abstract: We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.

*Ivan Oliinyk,Andrey Sarikov*

TL;DR: 3D Monte Carlo lattice model simulates phase separation in nonstoichiometric SiOx films, showing how initial stoichiometry and film thickness control Si nanoparticle vs. network formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric silicon oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films, which is important for controlling Si nanoparticle or network formation in thin film applications.

Method: Developed a three-dimensional lattice model using Monte Carlo approach that incorporates SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic oxygen atom migration driven by free energy minimization.

Result: Initial stoichiometry x critically determines morphology: isolated Si nanoparticles form at x ≥ 1.4, interconnected Si networks appear at x ≤ 0.8. Film thickness imposes geometric constraints - percolation threshold shifts from xp ≈ 1.35 (bulk) to xp ≈ 0.85 (quasi-2D films). Transition to bulk behavior occurs at ~4.2 nm thickness.

Conclusion: Both initial stoichiometry and film thickness are crucial parameters controlling Si phase morphology during phase separation in SiOx films, with thickness-dependent geometric constraints significantly affecting percolation thresholds and network formation.

Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.

Motivation: To understand the electronic properties of intrinsic defects in CuInS2 and CuGaS2 materials, particularly how HSE functional parameters affect band gap calculations and defect characterization, and to improve the connection between theoretical predictions and experimental photoluminescence measurements.

Method: Used Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme to study intrinsic defects. Investigated impact of HSE parameters (α and ω) on band gap and Koopmans' theorem compliance. Applied formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels. Analyzed connection between charge-transition levels and optical-transition levels, and calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission to account for lattice relaxation effects.

Result: The study shows that including lattice relaxation effects (Franck-Condon shifts) brings theoretical predictions closer to experimental photoluminescence measurements. The investigation of HSE parameters provides insights into band gap tuning and defect characterization accuracy.

Conclusion: Lattice relaxation is crucial for accurate defect attribution to luminescence peaks in CuInS2 and CuGaS2. Proper treatment of HSE parameters and inclusion of Franck-Condon shifts improves agreement between theoretical defect predictions and experimental photoluminescence data.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of common intrinsic defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$ using the Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme. The impact of the two HSE parameters, $α$ and $ω$ on the band gap and compliance with the generalized Koopmans' theorem is investigated. Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks. Our results show that once these effects are included, predictions become closer to photoluminescence measurements available in literature.

Motivation: To understand the complexity and growth patterns of energy-minimizing configurations on a sphere with logarithmic potential interactions, similar to the Thomson problem but with different potential.

Method: Detailed exploration of energy landscape using techniques from previous work, analyzing local minima configurations up to N=160 and stationary states up to N=24.

Result: Number of distinct configurations (N_conf) grows exponentially with N, though slower than Thomson problem. Number of stationary states also grows exponentially for N≤24.

Conclusion: Logarithmic potential on sphere exhibits exponential growth in both distinct energy-minimizing configurations and stationary states, indicating complex energy landscape similar to but distinct from Thomson problem.

Abstract: We have performed a detailed exploration of the energy landscape for configurations of points on the sphere, interacting via the logarithmic potential, and corresponding to local minima of the total energy, up to $N = 160$. The growth of $N_{\rm conf}$ (number of distinct configurations) is exponential, as for the Thomson problem, although weaker. Using the techniques described in our previous paper~\cite{Amore25} we have also explored the solution landscape of this problem for $N \leq 24$, and found that the number of stationary states is growing exponentially.

Motivation: To understand the non-degeneracy properties of minimal hypersurfaces that approach cones at infinity, and to develop tools for solving the Jacobi equation on such surfaces, which is important for studying stability and deformation properties.

Method: Analyzes the Jacobi operator J_Σ = Δ_Σ + |A_Σ|² of minimal hypersurfaces asymptotic to cones, studies its non-degeneracy properties, and constructs a right inverse operator to solve J_Σφ = f under suitable assumptions about Σ and the asymptotic behavior of f.

Result: Establishes non-degeneracy properties of minimal hypersurfaces via their Jacobi operators, proves existence of a right inverse for the Jacobi operator, and demonstrates solvability of the Jacobi equation under appropriate conditions on the hypersurface and forcing term.

Conclusion: The paper provides analytical tools for studying minimal hypersurfaces asymptotic to cones by establishing non-degeneracy results and constructing right inverses for their Jacobi operators, with applications to various examples in minimal surface theory.

Abstract: In this paper we study non-degeneracy properties of $Σ$ via the Jacobi operator $J_Σ:=Δ_Σ+|A_Σ|^2$ of a given minimal hypersurface $Σ$ asymptotic to a cone $C\subset \mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ of co-dimension one. Here $Δ_Σ$ is the Laplace Beltrami operator of $Σ$ and $|A_Σ|$ is the norm of the second fundamental form of $Σ$. We also construct a right inverse of $J_Σ$, that is, we prove that the Jacobi equation $J_Σφ=f$ is solvable in $Σ$, at least under some suitable non-degeneracy assumptions about $Σ$ and about the asymptotic behavior of $f$ at infinity. We also discuss some examples where our results can be applied.

Motivation: LWFA offers compact high-brightness electron beam sources for next-generation accelerators, but needs optimization for high-quality GeV beams with low energy spread.

Method: Two-section capillary design: short injection region with He-N2 mixture for electron injection, followed by pure He acceleration section. Hydrodynamic simulations optimize gas profiles, then Particle-In-Cell simulations study LWFA with 100 TW-class laser parameters.

Result: Electron acceleration to mean energies >1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Tailored density profiles reduce energy spread by limiting continuous ionization injection. Self-injected He electrons observed and evaluated.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates effective LWFA beam optimization using two-section capillary design, providing valuable insights for upcoming EuPRAXIA Project experiments at ELI Beamlines Facility.

Abstract: Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) is a promising approach for producing high-brightness electron beams in the GeV energy range, offering significant potential for compact next-generation accelerator facilities. In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for upcoming LWFA experiments planned within the EuPRAXIA Project at the ELI Beamlines Facility.

Result: Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations with k^{-3/2} cascade (dynamic alignment theory). Kinetically-driven simulations show k^{-1} scaling (reflection-driven turbulence). Residual energy is positive with spectral slope α depending on β: β=4.0: -2≲α≲-5/3; β=1.0: -5/3≲α≲-3/2; β=0.3: α≈-1.

Conclusion: Driving mechanism and plasma beta significantly influence residual energy cascade in weakly compressible MHD turbulence. Different scalings reveal distinct physical mechanisms: dynamic alignment for magnetic driving vs reflection-driven turbulence for kinetic driving.

Abstract: The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r < 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r > $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfvén Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($β$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfvénic fluctuations and a $\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfvén waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($α$) depending on $β$ as: for $β= 4.0$, $-2 \lesssim α\lesssim -5/3$, for $β= 1.0$, $-5/3 \lesssim α\lesssim -3/2$, and for $β= 0.3$, $α\approx -1$.

### [83] [The Maximum Particle Energy Gain During Magnetic Reconnection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13394)
*Zhiyu Yin,Harry Arnold,James F Drake,Marc Swisdak*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: The paper investigates how system size affects maximum particle energy gain during magnetic reconnection, finding that multiple flux rope mergers through Fermi reflection drive energy gain, with larger systems enabling more mergers and higher maximum energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed that maximum particle energy gain increases with system size during magnetic reconnection, but the physical basis for this relationship was not understood. The authors aim to investigate why larger systems produce higher maximum energies.

Method: The researchers used analytical investigation and large-scale simulations with the kglobal model, varying the effective system size over a large range to isolate processes determining maximum energy gain. They tracked magnetic-island mergers and flux rope formation.

Result: Maximum energy gain (W_max) is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur. Larger systems produce more flux ropes and more mergers, with Fermi reflection during these repeated mergers dominating particle energy gain. The number of mergers determines the maximum attainable energy.

Conclusion: The link between maximum particle energy and number of flux rope mergers explains why particle-in-cell simulations produce powerlaw distributions with limited energy ranges. System size controls the number of mergers, which in turn regulates maximum energy gain during magnetic reconnection.

Abstract: The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.

### [84] [Numerical Assessment of Advective and Diffusive Dynamics of Interacting and Isolated Prototypical Convectively Initiated Circulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11828)
*Matthew R. Igel,Joseph A. Biello,Adele L. Igel*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: KRoNUT model effectively represents full convective circulation including updrafts, compensating descent, and horizontal motions, outperforming plume models and accurately simulating dry dynamics of isolated/interacting convective circulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plume models only represent updraft regions of convective clouds, missing the complete circulation that includes compensating descent, cloud-free air, and horizontal motions. A more comprehensive representation is needed to understand full convective dynamics.

Method: Developed Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model to represent entire convective flow. Compared KRoNUT's skill against plume models using high-resolution marine tropical convection simulations. Used KRoNUT to analyze dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under advection and diffusion only.

Result: KRoNUT outperforms plume representations. Vertical advection of vertical wind is most important advective tendency in clouds, but horizontal circulation components play crucial role in evolution without buoyancy. Strong flow curvature near surface/updraft core creates scale-dependent diffusive tendencies. KRoNUT tendencies match simulation results well. Interacting circulations show diverse dynamics including unique stability of geometric properties and clustering of circulation centers.

Conclusion: KRoNUT provides superior representation of complete convective circulation compared to plume models, capturing essential dynamics of both isolated and interacting convective systems under dry conditions, with implications for understanding convective organization and stability.

Abstract: The bulk circulation associated with convective clouds includes not only a region of updraft and cloudy air but also a region of compensating descent and cloud-free air and horizontal motions coupling these regions. The Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model is a simple representation of this entire flow. First, the skill of the KRoNUT in representing flows from a high resolution full-physics simulation of marine tropical convection is compared to various plume representations of convection. Then the KRoNUT is used to construct bulk descriptions of the dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under the influence of advection and diffusion (only). Cross sections of advective and diffusive tendencies show that while vertical advection of the vertical wind is the most important advective tendency in clouds, the horizontal component of the convective circulation and advection thereof plays a crucial role in the evolution of circulations in the absence of buoyancy. Strong curvature of the flow near the surface and near the updraft core results in locally strong diffusive tendencies that depend on scale. Cross sections of tendencies from the KRoNUT compare favourably to results from the simulation. Interacting circulations are shown to exhibit a wide range of dynamics with some cases of interactions leading to unique stability of geometric properties of otherwise evolving flows and some leading to geometric clustering of circulation centers.

### [85] [Noise-robust Contrastive Learning for Critical Transition Detection in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12523)
*Wenqi Fang,Ye Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight neural network with SVD architecture and semi-orthogonality constraints improves contrastive learning for detecting critical transitions in noisy time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical transitions in complex systems are hard to detect due to noise masking order parameters, and existing contrastive learning methods are overparameterized and noise-sensitive.

Method: Propose a neural network architecture using singular value decomposition with strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm to enhance contrastive learning.

Result: The method matches traditional contrastive learning performance in identifying critical transitions while being more lightweight and significantly more noise-resistant.

Conclusion: The proposed SVD-based architecture with orthogonality constraints provides an effective, efficient solution for critical transition detection in noisy time-series data.

Abstract: Detecting critical transitions in complex, noisy time-series data is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Such transitions may be anticipated by the emergence of a low-dimensional order parameter, whose signature is often masked by high-amplitude stochastic variability. Standard contrastive learning approaches based on deep neural networks, while promising for detecting critical transitions, are often overparameterized and sensitive to irrelevant noise, leading to inaccurate identification of critical points. To address these limitations, we propose a neural network architecture, constructed using singular value decomposition technique, together with a strictly semi-orthogonality-constrained training algorithm, to enhance the performance of traditional contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method matches the performance of traditional contrastive learning techniques in identifying critical transitions, yet is considerably more lightweight and markedly more resistant to noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation networks can achieve superior approximation capabilities compared to classical ReLU networks, with explicit and improved complexity control for smooth function approximation.

Method: Develop a novel hierarchical construction beginning with an efficient approximation of the square function x² that is more compact in depth and size than comparable ReLU realizations. Extend this approach through functional composition to establish sharp approximation bounds for deep SiLU networks approximating Sobolev-class functions.

Result: SiLU networks achieve approximation error decaying as O(ω^{-2k}) using networks of depth O(1). For Sobolev-class functions, they achieve total depth O(1) and size O(ε^{-d/n}), demonstrating exponential approximation rates with improved complexity control.

Conclusion: SiLU activation networks provide a theoretically superior alternative to ReLU networks for smooth function approximation, offering exponential approximation rates with explicit and improved complexity bounds through a novel hierarchical construction methodology.

Abstract: This article establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework demonstrating that SiLU (Sigmoid Linear Unit) activation networks achieve exponential approximation rates for smooth functions with explicit and improved complexity control compared to classical ReLU-based constructions. We develop a novel hierarchical construction beginning with an efficient approximation of the square function $x^2$ more compact in depth and size than comparable ReLU realizations, such as those given by Yarotsky. This construction yields an approximation error decaying as $\mathcal{O}(ω^{-2k})$ using networks of depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We then extend this approach through functional composition to establish sharp approximation bounds for deep SiLU networks in approximating Sobolev-class functions, with total depth $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and size $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/n})$.

*Yuriy N. Bakhvalov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives regression methods from first principles using indifference postulates and symmetry properties, showing that generalized polyharmonic splines emerge naturally as optimal kernels without empirical selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for regression methods by deriving them from first principles rather than empirical selection, connecting machine learning regression to multivariate approximation theory using random function theory.

Method: Uses the theory of random functions and postulates of indifference to derive regression methods analytically. Assumes probability measures on infinite-dimensional function spaces possess natural symmetries (translation, rotation, scaling invariance, and Gaussianity).

Result: The entire regression solution scheme (kernel form, regularization type, noise parameterization) follows analytically from symmetry postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with generalized polyharmonic splines, providing theoretical justification rather than empirical selection.

Conclusion: The indifference principle provides a theoretical foundation for smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality when no a priori information is available, connecting machine learning regression to fundamental mathematical principles.

Abstract: This paper studies a machine learning regression problem as a multivariate approximation problem using the framework of the theory of random functions. An ab initio derivation of a regression method is proposed, starting from postulates of indifference. It is shown that if a probability measure on an infinite-dimensional function space possesses natural symmetries (invariance under translation, rotation, scaling, and Gaussianity), then the entire solution scheme, including the kernel form, the type of regularization, and the noise parameterization, follows analytically from these postulates. The resulting kernel coincides with a generalized polyharmonic spline; however, unlike existing approaches, it is not chosen empirically but arises as a consequence of the indifference principle. This result provides a theoretical foundation for a broad class of smoothing and interpolation methods, demonstrating their optimality in the absence of a priori information.

Conclusion: KD-PINN enables development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers with sub-10ms real-time performance while maintaining high physical accuracy through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: This work introduces Knowledge-Distilled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (KD-PINN), a framework that transfers the predictive accuracy of a high-capacity teacher model to a compact student through a continuous adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). In all tested cases, the student model preserved the teacher's physical accuracy, with a mean RMSE increase below 0.64%, and achieved inference speedups ranging from 4.8x (Navier-Stokes) to 6.9x (Burgers). The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-tier Federated IoT systems, unstable connectivity and adversarial interference can silently alter transmitted model parameters during FL training, degrading convergence.
