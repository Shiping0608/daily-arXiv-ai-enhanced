This composition yields families of functions that remain dense in the space of continuous functions, while enabling more accurate approximations. For univariate continuous functions exhibiting a finite number of local extrema, we prove that there exist a polynomial of finite degree and a homeomorphism whose composition approximates the target function to arbitrary accuracy. The construction is especially relevant for multivariate approximation problems, where standard numerical methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To support our theoretical results, we investigate both regression tasks and the construction of molecular potential-energy surfaces, parametrizing the underlying homeomorphism using invertible neural networks. The numerical experiments show strong agreement with our theoretical analysis."}

POD uses snapshot data to build a reduced basis, which is then used to project the FOM. Minimally Invasive POD leverages the sweep infrastructure within deterministic Sn transport solvers to construct the reduced linear system, even though the FOM linear system is never directly assembled. OMMI-POD extends Minimally Invasive POD by performing transport sweeps offline, thereby maximizing the potential speedup. It achieves this by generating a library of reduced systems from a training set, which is then interpolated in the online stage to provide a rapid approximate solution to the Sn transport equation. The model's performance is evaluated on a multigroup 2-D test problem, demonstrating low error and a 1600-fold speedup over the full order model."}

We devise a numerical integral invariant diagnostic for checking preservation of symplecticity in particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic plasma simulation codes. As a first application of this diagnostic tool, we check the preservation of symplecticity in symplectic electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods.

In this work, simulations are used to study the impact of this ion motion on the development of the self-modulation of a long beam, directly applicable to recent experiments. It is shown that two related but distinct effects contribute to the suppression of the wakefield excitation: the loss of resonance between the drive beam and the plasma wave it excites, and phase mixing due to transverse wavebreaking. Although only the latter has previously been investigated, we show that the two effects follow the same scaling with ion mass."}

Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature.

Numerical examples demonstrate that the direct solver based on the proposed formulation is approximately 40% faster than the ordinary formulation when the LU-factorization-based solver is used.

The FEEC framework preserves the geometric and topological structure of continuous spaces and PDEs in the discrete spaces and model, and helps build stable and convergent discretizations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, this structure is encoded in the de Rham complex. In this work, we consider the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation discretized within the FEEC framework. We model the effect of the unresolved scales on the finite-dimensional solution by introducing appropriate fine-scale governing equations, which we also discretize using the FEEC approach. This preserves the structure of the continuous problem in both the coarse- and fine-scale solutions; for instance, both the coarse- and fine-scale velocities are pointwise incompressible. We demonstrate that the resulting formulation is residual-based, energetically stable, and optimally convergent. Moreover, our fine-scale model provides an efficient computational approach: by decoupling fine-scale problems across elements, they can be solved in parallel. In fact, the fine-scale equations can be eliminated during matrix assembly, leading to a VMS formulation in which the problem size is governed solely by the coarse-scale discretization. Finally, the proposed formulation applies to both the lowest regularity discretizations of the de Rham complex and high-regularity isogeometric discretizations. We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, simulating both steady-, unsteady-, viscous-, and inviscid-flow problems. These tests show that the stabilized solutions are qualitatively better than the unstabilized ones, converge at optimal rates, and, as the mesh is refined, the stabilization is asymptotically turned off."}

For linear systems, a small reduced dimension directly translates into low computational cost, ensuring online efficiency. This property does not generally hold for nonlinear systems, where an additional approximation of nonlinear terms -- known as complexity reduction -- is required. To achieve online efficiency, empirical quadrature and cell-based empirical cubature are among the most effective complexity reduction techniques. However, existing offline training algorithms can be prohibitively expensive because they operate on raw snapshot data of all nonlinear integrands associated with the reduced model. In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing approach based on a specific structured compression of the training data. Its key feature is that it scales only with the number of collected snapshots, rather than additionally with the reduced model dimension. Overall, this yields roughly an order-of-magnitude reduction in offline computational cost and memory requirements, thereby enabling the application of the complexity reduction methods to larger-scale problems. Accuracy is preserved, as indicated by our error analysis and demonstrated through numerical examples."}

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws."}

Our main results establish fundamental short-time existence and Shi-type smoothing properties of this flow, as well as a classification of its fixed points. By a classical rigidity result in the string theory literature, the fixed points on a compact manifold correspond to torsion-free $G_2$-structures, that is, to metrics with holonomy contained in $G_2$. Thus, we establish in the affirmative a folklore question in the special holonomy community, about the existence of a well-posed flow for coclosed $G_2$-structures with fixed points given by torsion-free $G_2$-structures. The flow also satisfies a monotonicity formula for the $G_2$-dilaton functional (volume scale in string theory), which allows us to strengthen the rigidity result with an alternative proof. The monotonicity of the $G_2$-dilaton functional, combined with the Shi-type estimates, leads to a general result on the convergence of nonsingular solutions.

This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing."}

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes."}

Leveraging the property of parabolic regularity for composite models, we show that the second-order subderivative of the cost function reduces to the novel second-order variational function playing a crucial role in the subsequent analysis. This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition (SSOSC) introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including the SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and the SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms."}

We introduce an extrapolation strategy into a class of preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems. The proposed algorithms combine second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF2) with an extrapolation method. Meanwhile, the implicit-explicit scheme simplifies the subproblem through a preconditioned process. As a result, our approach solves nonconvex problems efficiently without significant computational overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes global convergence of the algorithms using Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz properties. Numerical experiments include a benchmark problem, the least squares problem with SCAD regularization, and an image segmentation problem. These results demonstrate that our algorithms are highly efficient, as they achieve reduced solution times and competitive performance."}

Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications."}

In the forward setting, the PINN predicts velocity and pressure for discontinuous, piecewise-constant permeability; in the inverse setting, it identifies spatially varying permeability directly from indirect flow observations. Both models use a region-aware permeability parameterization with binary spatial masks, which preserves sharp permeability jumps and avoids the smoothing artifacts common in standard PINNs. To stabilize training, we introduce self-learned loss weights that automatically balance PDE residuals, boundary constraints, and data mismatch, eliminating manual tuning and improving robustness, particularly for inverse problems. An interleaved AdamW-L-BFGS optimization strategy further accelerates and stabilizes convergence. Numerical results demonstrate accurate forward surrogates and reliable inverse permeability recovery, establishing the method as an effective mesh-free solver and data-driven inversion tool for porous-media systems governed by partial differential equations."}
