The FEEC framework preserves the geometric and topological structure of continuous spaces and PDEs in the discrete spaces and model, and helps build stable and convergent discretizations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, this structure is encoded in the de Rham complex. In this work, we consider the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation discretized within the FEEC framework. We model the effect of the unresolved scales on the finite-dimensional solution by introducing appropriate fine-scale governing equations, which we also discretize using the FEEC approach. This preserves the structure of the continuous problem in both the coarse- and fine-scale solutions; for instance, both the coarse- and fine-scale velocities are pointwise incompressible. We demonstrate that the resulting formulation is residual-based, energetically stable, and optimally convergent. Moreover, our fine-scale model provides an efficient computational approach: by decoupling fine-scale problems across elements, they can be solved in parallel. In fact, the fine-scale equations can be eliminated during matrix assembly, leading to a VMS formulation in which the problem size is governed solely by the coarse-scale discretization. Finally, the proposed formulation applies to both the lowest regularity discretizations of the de Rham complex and high-regularity isogeometric discretizations.
