Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature.

While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity.

For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested.

Model error directly affects model credibility and predictive reliability; yet its characterization remains challenging. To address this need, we introduce a bootstrap-based stochastic subspace model for characterizing model error in the stochastic reduced-order modeling framework.

However, experimental measurements and statistical theories of turbulence are based on the Reynolds number. Thus, a meaningful comparison between mathematical and physical results requires a conversion of the mathematical estimates to a Reynolds-dependent form. In two dimensions, this was achieved under the assumption that the second derivative of the forcing is square integrable. Nonetheless, numerical simulations have shown that the phenomenology of turbulence is sensitive to the degree of regularity of the forcing. Therefore, we extend the available estimates for the energy and enstrophy dissipation rates as well as the attractor dimension to forcings in the Sobolev space of order $s$; i.e. forcings whose Fourier coefficients decay with the wavenumber $k$ faster than $k^{-s-1}$. We consider the range $-1\\leqslant s\\leqslant 2$, where $s=2$ corresponds to the known estimates, and $s=-1$ is the smallest value of $s$ for which weak solutions are known to exist.
