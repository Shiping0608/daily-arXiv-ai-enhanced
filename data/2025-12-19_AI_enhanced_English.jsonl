Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thesis develops efficient randomized algorithms for matrix computations: RPCholesky for low-rank PSD approximation, leave-one-out methods for implicit matrix attribute estimation, and backward-stable randomized least-squares solvers.", "motivation": "Randomized algorithms are fundamental in computational linear algebra but need to use information efficiently to maximize speed and accuracy given limited data budgets.

This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution.

The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models.

In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems using neural networks to combine predictions from solvers of varying fidelity, avoiding expensive high-fidelity simulations during online inference.", "motivation": "Traditional inverse uncertainty quantification methods are computationally expensive for physics-based models requiring repeated evaluations of complex numerical solvers.
