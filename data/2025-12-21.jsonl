Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm."}

At the finest level, the meshes consist of triangular elements which are geometrically coarsened at each step to form convex polygonal elements. Smooth field regions of the domain are solved with fewer, larger, polygonal elements, whereas high-gradient regions are represented by smaller elements, thereby improving memory efficiency through adaptivity. The proposed algorithm computes solutions via sequences of hierarchical sparse linear-algebra operations with nearly linear computational complexity."}

We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications."}

Previous studies have addressed these challenges through adaptive grids, parameter tuning, or hybrid integration with other clustering methods, each of which offers limited robustness. This paper introduces a grid clustering framework that integrates Laplacian-kernel diffusion imputation and origin-constrained connected-component analysis (OC-CCA) on a uniform grid to reconstruct the cluster topology with high accuracy and computational efficiency. During grid construction, an automated preprocessing stage provides data-driven estimates of cell size and density thresholds. The diffusion step then mitigates sparsity and reconstructs missing edge cells without over-smoothing physical gradients, while OC-CCA constrains component growth to physically consistent origins, reducing false merges across narrow gaps. Operating on a fixed-resolution grid with spatial indexing ensures the scaling of O(nlog n). Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and polymer simulation datasets demonstrate that the method correctly manages edges, preserves cluster topology, and avoids spurious connections. Benchmarking on polymer systems across scales (9k, 180k, and 989k atoms) shows that optimal preprocessing, combined with diffusion-based clustering, reproduces atomic-level accuracy and captures physically meaningful morphologies while delivering accelerated computation."}

This study investigates the origins of binding energy shifts and satellite peaks formation observed during plasma XPS measurements across conductive, dielectric, and gas phase systems. Using a standard laboratory based ambient pressure XPS apparatus coupled with an alternating current driven capacitively coupled plasma source, we show that metastable surface species, such as transient Au oxides, can be detected during plasma exposure, revealing chemical states hardly accessible using conventional ultrahigh vacuum XPS. In dielectric samples, we observe pressure- and plasma type dependent BE shifts up to 50 eV, attributed to X ray induced and plasma mediated surface charging. These shifts are mitigated at higher pressures plasmas or in electronegative plasmas, the latter due to enhanced charge compensation mechanisms involving slow negative ions. For gas phase species, AC plasma excitation leads to spectral broadening and the emergence of satellite peaks with a few eV energy separations, linked to oscillating local plasma potentials in the probing volume. These findings highlight the important and complex interplay of plasma parameters, surface charging, and local electric fields in shaping XPS spectra. Overall, plasma XPS emerges as a critical metrological tool for probing transient surface chemistry, with implications for semiconductor processing, material synthesis, and plasma diagnostics."}

The coils have many disparate engineering requirements from structural to power electronics, as well strict limits placed on the system by the high temperature superconducting (HTS) cables. Simultaneously, the coils must be able to contain multiple plasma scenarios from inception, through ramp up, to flat top, and ramp down, all whilst applying a large, controlled, inductive voltage to drive current. In addition, we wish to optimize divertor separatrices to increase the likelihood of designing a suitable divertor strikepoint. Lastly, the physical limits of the entire tokamak must be taken into account and space reserved for support structures, access for maintenance schemes, and installation limits. The method outlined here uses a combined simulated annealing method to find optimal coil sizes and positions with a constrained quadratic or quartic optimization for the coil currents. The method is designed to optimize coils for multiple scenarios simultaneously, including ramp-ups, to avoid over optimization of a single design point. A key enabler is the efficient implementation that allows millions of evaluations to be performed in a few hours with modest computational power.

This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices.

One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency.

We demonstrate that, the network performs accurate plasma boundary reconstruction for complex configurations, outperforming well established methods, such as the algorithm used for decades at the Joint European Torus, the world's largest tokamak, until it ceased operation in 2023. Indeed, compared to the latter, the proposed solution better generalizes the poloidal flux function, without requiring algorithm retuning across different plasma equilibria. The proposed neural network reconstructor demonstrates also greater robustness with respect to noise on the magnetic measurements. Moreover, this method takes advantage of the generalization power of neural networks but without the need for extensive, time consuming training based on a huge amount of experimental data, making its implementation on existing devices straightforward."}

Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states.

The suppressed diffusion can be attributed to self-generated magnetic turbulence, driven -- via the non-resonant streaming instability -- by electron--positron pairs escaping the PWNe. This instability requires a net current, yet the beam of escaping pairs is expected to be charge-neutral. We show that a charge-neutral pair beam propagating through an electron--proton plasma can spontaneously generate a net current. Using fully kinetic two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with realistic mass ratio, we find that beam electrons get focused into self-generated magnetic filaments produced by the nonlinear evolution of the Weibel instability, while beam positrons remain unconfined. The resulting net (positron) current drives the non-resonant streaming instability, further amplifying the magnetic field. This mechanism provides a pathway for the onset of charge asymmetries in initially charge-neutral pair beams and for the growth of magnetic fluctuations that efficiently scatter the beam particles, with implications for the formation of X-ray filaments and, more broadly, for particle self-confinement in TeV halos around PWNe."}

This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices. These analyses have proven instrumental in shaping ST-E1 development, offering critical insights for mitigating risks and optimising future fusion reactor designs."}

Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models."}

When partial differential equations are involved, full-order models such as those based on the Finite Element Method can make traditional sampling approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computationally infeasible. Although data-driven surrogate models may help reduce evaluation costs, their utility is often limited by the expense of generating high-fidelity data. In contrast, low-fidelity data can be produced more efficiently, although relying on them alone may degrade the accuracy of the inverse UQ solution.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Fidelity Delayed Acceptance scheme for Bayesian inverse problems. Extending the Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance framework, the method introduces multi-fidelity neural networks that combine the predictions of solvers of varying fidelity, with high fidelity evaluations restricted to an offline training stage. During the online phase, likelihood evaluations are obtained by evaluating the coarse solvers and passing their outputs to the trained neural networks, thereby avoiding additional high-fidelity simulations.\n  This construction allows heterogeneous coarse solvers to be incorporated consistently within the hierarchy, providing greater flexibility than standard Multi-Level Delayed Acceptance. The proposed approach improves the approximation accuracy of the low fidelity solvers, leading to longer sub-chain lengths, better mixing, and accelerated posterior inference. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated on two benchmark inverse problems involving (i) steady isotropic groundwater flow, (ii) an unsteady reaction-diffusion system, for which substantial computational savings are obtained."}

However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade."}

Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy.

Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum.
