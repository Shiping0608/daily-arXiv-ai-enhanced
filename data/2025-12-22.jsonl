This failure mode is quite common in numerical simulations of fluids and plasmas. Lawson proposed Generalized Runge-Kutta Processes for stiff problems in 1967, in which the stiff linear operator is treated fully implicitly via matrix exponentiation. Any Runge-Kutta scheme induces valid Lawson integration, but a scheme is exceptionally simple to implement if the abscissa $c_i$ are ordered and equally spaced. Classical RK4 satisfies this requirement, but it is difficult to derive efficient higher order schemes with this constraint. Here I present an explicit sixth order method identified with Newton-Raphson iteration that provides simple Lawson integration."}

Our approach builds upon a parameter robust total pressure formulation of the Biot system, which we combine with the cut finite element method to develop a geometrically robust solution scheme, while preserving the parameter robustness. A key ingredient in the theoretical analysis is a modified inf-sup condition which also holds for mixed boundary conditions, leading to stability and optimal error estimates for the proposed formulation.

However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom.

We evaluated the widely used Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm and the newer Maximum a Posteriori approach with Entropy prior (MAP-Ent) approach in the context of quantifying radiopharmaceutical uptake in pathological lesions. Numerical experiments were performed using a digital twin of the standardized NEMA IEC phantom, which contains six spheres of varying diameters to simulate lesions. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using the maximum recovery coefficient (RCmax), defined as the ratio of the reconstructed maximum activity to the true value. The study shows that OSEM exhibits unstable convergence during iterations, leading to noise and edge artifacts in lesion images. Post-filtering stabilizes the reconstruction and ensures convergence, producing RCmax-size curves that could be used as correction factors in clinical evaluations. However, this approach significantly underestimates uptake in small lesions and may even lead to the complete loss of small lesions on reconstructed images. In contrast, MAP-Ent demonstrates fundamentally different behavior: it achieves stable convergence and preserves quantitative accuracy without post-filtering, while maintaining the contrast of even the smallest lesions. However, the iteration number at which accurate reconstruction is achieved depends strongly on the choice of a single global regularization parameter, which limits optimal performance across lesions of different sizes. These results demonstrate the need for locally adaptive regularization in MAP-Ent to improve quantitative accuracy in lesion reconstruction."}

Experimental evidence supporting the predator-prey relationship between turbulence and flows as the basis for the L-H transition, found for the first time in TJ-II, reinforces this conclusion.

In this approach, the physical domain is represented independently from the computational mesh, allowing the latter to be generated more easily compared with body-fitted meshes. While this facilitates the treatment of complex geometries, it also introduces challenges, such as ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix caused by small cut elements and difficulties in accurately enforcing boundary conditions. A recently proposed technique to address these issues is the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM), which represents the computational domain solely through uncut elements and enforces boundary conditions via a Taylor expansion from a surrogate boundary to the true boundary. Previous studies have shown that, for Neumann boundary conditions, the flux evaluation requires additional derivatives in the Taylor expansion, effectively reducing the order of convergence by one. In this work, we investigate for the first time the performance of SBM combined with Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) under various local refinement strategies. In particular, we propose local p- and k-refinement schemes for THB-splines and compare them with local h-refinement and the unmodified SBM. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced shift operator that incorporates mixed partial derivatives, in contrast to the standard operator. The study assesses accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for benchmark problems on trimmed domains. The results highlight how different refinement strategies affect convergence behavior in trimmed IGA formulations using SBM and demonstrate that targeted degree elevation can mitigate the Neumann boundary limitations of the standard method."}

The resonant trident process is defined by two characteristic quantum energies: the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Compton effect and the characteristic energy of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. These characteristic energies depend significantly on the frequency and intensity of the wave, as well as on the angle between the momenta of the initial electrons and the electromagnetic wave. The resonant trident process is effective when the energy of the initial electrons is greater than or on the order of magnitude of the corresponding characteristic energies. It is shown that quantum entanglement of final particles takes place in this resonant process. An important aspect of the resonant trident process is the equality of the energies of the electron and positron pairs. Analytical expressions for the differential rates of the resonant trident process on the energy of final particles are obtained. The corresponding analytical expressions for full rates have also been obtained. It is shown that the rate data of the resonant trident process in the field of optical and X-ray wave frequencies significantly exceed the corresponding rate of the non-resonant trident process.

However, the scaling is not well observed, and it is uncertain whether the scaling constant ($C_0$) truly approaches a constant value at asymptotic Reynolds numbers. In this paper, direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers between 140 and 1300 is used to help advance understanding in this subject. Uncertainties arising from modest simulation time spans are addressed by expressing the velocity structure function in terms of the acceleration autocorrelation, which suggests that $C_0$ may be sensitive to intermittency effects, leading to a sustained, although weak, Reynolds number dependence. The Lagrangian velocity increment is examined from a spatial-temporal perspective, as a combination of convective (spatial) and local (temporal) contributions, which are subject to a strong but incomplete mutual cancellation dependent on Reynolds number and time lag. The convective increment is strongly influenced by the particle displacement, which is driven by large-scale dynamics and can thus grow into inertial range dimensions in space within just a few Kolmogorov time scales, without fully satisfying classical Lagrangian inertial-range requirements. An overall conclusion in this work is that both the limited range of time scales (narrower than for length scales) and the effects of particle displacements have significant roles in the observed behavior of the second-order Lagrangian velocity structure function."}

Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection."}

Motivated by the classical no-slip paradox which states that the Navier-Stokes equations with a no-slip boundary condition require unphysical infinite dissipation during droplet spreading, we focus on the limit of vanishing slip. We show that in the no-slip limit three fundamentally different classes of limiting solutions are approached, each of them corresponding to a different scaling of the microscopic contact angle as the regularization parameter vanishes. These findings suggest that the thin-film equation with no slip supports a rich family of physically admissible solutions, provided one interprets the no-slip thin film equation as the asymptotic limit of models which regularized slip conditions. Even though the large apparent contact angles in some of these solutions seem incompatible with the lubrication approximation, a refined analysis shows that the underlying physical variables remain consistent with the assumptions for the lubrication approximation."}

In such models, the elastic stress appearing in the macroscopic continuum equation is derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, which makes direct numerical simulations computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal asymptotic scheme that expands the density function around an equilibrium distribution, thereby reducing the high computational cost associated with the fully coupled microscopic processes while still maintaining the dynamic microscopic feedback in explicit expressions. The proposed asymptotic expansion is based on a detailed physical scaling law which characterizes the multiscale balance at the fast relaxation limit of the microscopic state. An asymptotic closure model for the macroscopic fluid equation is then derived according to the explicit asymptotic density expansion. Furthermore, the resulting closure model preserves the energy-dissipation law inherited from the original fully coupled multiscale system. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the asymptotic density formula and the corresponding flow velocity equations in several micro-macro models. This new asymptotic strategy offers a promising approach for efficient computations of a wide range of multiscale complex fluids."}

Despite a constant density, the model allows for non-isochoric deformation and the propagation of pressure waves. An additive decomposition of the strain rate into elastic and inelastic parts leads to an evolution equation for the small elastic strain, which is coupled with an adapted momentum equation. As plasticity is modeled through a non-smooth dissipation potential, we introduce a weak formulation in terms of a variational inequality. Since the well-posedness in such a weak setting is out of reach, we study two possible modifications: the regularization in terms of stress diffusion, and the relaxation of the solvability concept by transition to energy-variational solutions. In both cases, solutions are constructed by the same time-discrete scheme, consisting of solving a saddle-point problem in each time step."}

We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms.

Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary.

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals.

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests."}

We propose new boundary conditions for the displacement. These conditions are not usual in thermoelasticity. Whereas, we posit the Neumann boundary condition for the temperature. We prove the existence of global, unique solutions for small initial data. The temperature positivity is also shown. Next, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the divergence-free part of the displacement oscillates. On the other hand, we prove that the potential part and the temperature are strongly coupled. The non-rotation part is strongly affected by heat propagation. It turns out that it tends to $0$ as $x$ approaches infinity. Additionally, the temperature converges to a constant function.\n  Our techniques are firmly based on the functional $\\F$ adopted from {\\sc Bies, P.

In this sense, considering a fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes system and assuming the Reynolds number written in terms of the thickness $ε$, we prove that, for each regime, there exists a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ such that for every Reynolds number $Re$ with order smaller or equal than $Re_c$, the lower-dimensional Darcy law is still valid. On the contrary, for Reynolds numbers $Re$ greater than $Re_c$, the inertial term of the Navier-Stokes system has to be taken into account in the asymptotic behavior and so, the Darcy law is not valid."}

In particular, we pass to the limit in the ''full\" Wigner matrix equation without projecting on the eigenspaces of the matrix-valued symbol of the Dirac operator. In the limit, the Lagrange multiplier maintains the constraint that the Wigner measure and the symbol of the Dirac operator commute and vanishes when projected on the electron or positron eigenspace.

The evolution of the directions of motion follows a Vicsek model, where agents align their orientations with the mean orientation of their neighbors, subject to some noise. Similarly, the angular velocities relax towards the average angular velocity of the neighboring agents, also subject to noise. From the IBM we derive the corresponding kinetic equation in the limit of a large number of agents and formally obtain the macroscopic equations through a macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limit. Numerical simulations of the IBM reveal a variety of patterns, including rotating clusters, traveling orientation waves, and globally synchronized rotational motion.

We analyze some basic properties of the model, determine the conditions for existence of disinfection and coexistence states, including boundary equilibria and their stability. Numerical simulations are performed to explore different modeling scenarios and support our theoretical findings. Different antibiotic dosing strategies are then studied, starting with a continuous dosing; here we note that high doses of antibiotic are needed for bacterial elimination. We then consider periodic dosing, and again observe that insufficient levels of antibiotic per dose may lead to treatment failure. Finally, using an extended version of Pontryagin's maximum principle we determine efficient antibiotic dosing protocols, which ensure bacterial elimination while keeping the total dosing low; we note that this involves a tapered dosing which reinforces results presented in other clinical and modeling studies. We study the optimal dosing for different parameter values and note that the optimal dosing schedule is qualitatively robust."}
