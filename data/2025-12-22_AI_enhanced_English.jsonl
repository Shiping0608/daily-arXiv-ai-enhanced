In this approach, the physical domain is represented independently from the computational mesh, allowing the latter to be generated more easily compared with body-fitted meshes. While this facilitates the treatment of complex geometries, it also introduces challenges, such as ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix caused by small cut elements and difficulties in accurately enforcing boundary conditions. A recently proposed technique to address these issues is the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM), which represents the computational domain solely through uncut elements and enforces boundary conditions via a Taylor expansion from a surrogate boundary to the true boundary. Previous studies have shown that, for Neumann boundary conditions, the flux evaluation requires additional derivatives in the Taylor expansion, effectively reducing the order of convergence by one. In this work, we investigate for the first time the performance of SBM combined with Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) under various local refinement strategies. In particular, we propose local p- and k-refinement schemes for THB-splines and compare them with local h-refinement and the unmodified SBM. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced shift operator that incorporates mixed partial derivatives, in contrast to the standard operator.

In this paper, direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers between 140 and 1300 is used to help advance understanding in this subject. Uncertainties arising from modest simulation time spans are addressed by expressing the velocity structure function in terms of the acceleration autocorrelation, which suggests that $C_0$ may be sensitive to intermittency effects, leading to a sustained, although weak, Reynolds number dependence. The Lagrangian velocity increment is examined from a spatial-temporal perspective, as a combination of convective (spatial) and local (temporal) contributions, which are subject to a strong but incomplete mutual cancellation dependent on Reynolds number and time lag. The convective increment is strongly influenced by the particle displacement, which is driven by large-scale dynamics and can thus grow into inertial range dimensions in space within just a few Kolmogorov time scales, without fully satisfying classical Lagrangian inertial-range requirements.
