However, despite their effectiveness, traditional Monte Carlo methods often face challenges in controlling variance, resulting in noisy visual artifacts in regions that are difficult to render. In this work, we propose a new approach to the integration of the rendering equation by introducing a Voronoi tessellation reweighting scheme combined with a Poisson point process sampling strategy to address some of the limitations of standard Monte Carlo methods. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the variance induced by a Poisson-Voronoi tessellation is smaller than that of the Monte Carlo method when the intensity of the underlying process is arbitrarily large and when the function to be integrated satisfies a Holder continuity condition."}

This format can encode standard approximation tools, such as (sparse) polynomials, deep neural networks (DNNs) with fixed width, or tensor networks with arbitrary permutation of the inputs, or more general affine coordinate transformations, with similar complexities. This format can be viewed as a DNN with width exponential in the input dimension and structured weights matrices. Compared to DNNs, this format enables controlled compression at the layer level using efficient tensor algebra. On the optimization side, we derive a layerwise algorithm inspired by natural gradient descent, allowing to exploit efficient low-rank tensor algebra. This relies on low-rank estimations of Gram matrices, and tensor structured random sketching. Viewing the format as a discrete dynamical system, we also derive an optimization algorithm inspired by numerical methods in optimal control. Numerical experiments on regression tasks demonstrate the expressivity of the new format and the relevance of the proposed optimization algorithms. Overall, CTTs combine the expressivity of compositional models with the algorithmic efficiency of tensor algebra, offering a scalable alternative to standard deep neural networks."}

We prove conditional error bounds relating solution accuracy to trained loss values and quadrature errors.

Density scans are performed to reproduce the experimental roll-over of the outer-target ion saturation current and to investigate detachment physics for both forward and reverse toroidal magnetic field configurations. Consistent with experiments, the simulations show that approximately 40% higher density is required to reach detachment onset for forward BT compared to reverse BT, and that deep detachment is not achieved for reverse BT. Comparisons with positive triangularity Ohmic discharges further demonstrate that negative triangularity requires substantially higher densities, at or above the Greenwald limit, to access detachment. The modeling indicates that the increased difficulty of achieving detachment in negative triangularity arises from a shorter midplane-to-target connection length, a reduced outer divertor leg length, and lower cross-field transport compared to positive triangularity configurations."}

The Fredholm well-posedness of the BIEs on cornered domains is proved in weighted Sobolev spaces. We further construct an explicit density-to-Taylor mapping for the BIE and show its invertibility for all but a countable set of angles. Based on these analytical results, we propose a singularity guided Nyström (SGN) scheme for the numerical solution of BIEs on cornered domains. The SGN uses the computed corner exponents and a Legendre-tail indicator to drive panel refinement. An error analysis that combines this refinement strategy with an exponentially accurate far-field quadrature rule is provided. Numerical experiments across various cornered geometries demonstrate that SGN obtains higher order accuracy than uniform Nyström method and reveal a crowding-limited regime for domains with re-entrant angles."}

The method was chosen for its ability to yield crack paths that are independent of the underlying mesh, thanks to the damage regularization zone. In dynamics, we observe a progressive widening of this regularization zone and attribute it to an unphysical trapping of elastic waves. We show that the damage zones do not represent free boundaries accurately and that wave interactions induce additional damage. We reveal how mass erosion, by conserving the elastic wave speed in the damaged regions, can be used to efficiently reduce the spurious diffusion of damage. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that dynamically propagating cracks in the phase-field formulation, both with and without mass erosion, converge to the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics. For vanishing regularization length, the crack speed and energy release rate become independent of the phase-field regularization length, provided that this length scale is small enough and the mesh fine enough to resolve the process zone."}

In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed."}

To mitigate this, we present the first fully-coupled simulation of high-voltage pulsed discharges interacting with a Mach 24 flowfield. The results demonstrate that the applied electric field generates a large, non-neutral plasma sheath near the cathode, depleting electron density by several orders of magnitude over a distance commensurate with the height of the shock layer. This depletion window effectively reduces the attenuation of a 4 GHz signal from 60% to 4% with a manageable power requirement of 66 W per cm$^2$ of exposed cathode surface. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the sheath topology is governed principally by ion kinetics; specifically, corrections to ion mobility at high reduced electric fields lead to enhanced space-charge shielding and a subsequent contraction of the sheath. Conversely, the sheath structure is largely insensitive to the electron mobility model. Finally, we argue that the present drift-diffusion model likely yields a conservative lower bound for mitigation performance. A kinetic approach accounting for ballistic ion transport and non-local ionization would likely predict thicker sheaths and lower attenuation for equivalent power deposition."}

Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions."}

However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \\textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers."}

Based on this partial information, rigorous optimal upper and lower bounds on the probability of failure (PoF) are derived over the admissible set of probability measures, providing a principled basis for system safety certification. We formulate the OUQ problem under general subdomain moment constraints and develop a high-performance computational framework to compute the optimal bounds. This approach transforms the original infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional unconstrained ones parameterized solely by free canonical moments. To address the prohibitive cost of PoF evaluation in high-dimensional settings, we incorporate inverse transform sampling (ITS), enabling efficient and accurate PoF estimation within the OUQ optimization. We also demonstrate that constraining inputs only by zeroth-order moments over subdomains yields a formulation equivalent to evidence theory. Three groups of numerical examples demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and scalability. Results show that increasing the number of subdomains or the moment order systematically tightens the bound interval. For high-dimensional problems, the ITS strategy reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining relative error below 1%. Furthermore, we identify regimes where optimal bounds are sensitive to subdomain partitioning or higher-order moments, guiding uncertainty reduction efforts for safety certification."}

To alleviate this issue, we propose a cross-attention-based architecture that adaptively reweights a scaled multiscale random Fourier feature bank with learnable scaling factors. The learnable scaling adjusts the amplitudes of the multiscale random Fourier features, while the cross-attention residual structure provides an input-dependent mechanism to emphasize the most informative scales. As a result, the proposed design accelerates high-frequency convergence relative to comparable baselines built on the same multiscale bank. Moreover, the attention module supports incremental spectral enrichment: dominant Fourier modes extracted from intermediate approximations via discrete Fourier analysis can be appended to the feature bank and used in subsequent training, without modifying the backbone architecture.\n  We further extend this framework to PDE learning by introducing a linear combination of two sub-networks: one specialized in capturing high-frequency components of the PDE solution and the other in capturing low-frequency components, with a learnable (or optimally chosen) mixing factor to balance the two contributions and improve training efficiency in oscillatory regimes. Numerical experiments on high-frequency and discontinuous regression problems, image reconstruction tasks, as well as representative PDE examples, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."}

The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the Hénon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the Hénon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics.

This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect.

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today."}

Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 μm), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 μm). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%.

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population."}

It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values.

In contrast to energy-based arguments in the literature, a novel approach in the analysis considers the discrete dual norm of the residual as a computable measure for the linearization error. As a consequence, this paper provides the first convergence analysis with optimal rates of an adaptive iteratively linearized FEM beyond energy-minimization problems.

A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1,\\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear partial differential equations involving similar difficulties."}

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."}

Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials."}

This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework.

A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions."}

This fully explicit coupling approach is a very simple scheme which allows much flexibility in the implementation and has a lower computational cost, making it quite attractive in practice since smaller linear systems need to be solved in order to obtain the solution for the whole coupled poroelastic system. Due to the appealing advantages of these methods, intensive research is currently being carried out in this direction, as in the present work. Although the application of this type of method is very common in practice, there exist only a few works devoted to their theoretical analysis. In this work, we consider the so-called explicit fixed-stress split scheme, which consists of solving the flow problem first with time-lagging the displacement term, followed by the solution of the mechanics problem. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence analysis of the explicit fixed-stress split scheme for Biot's equations. In particular, we prove that this algorithm is optimally convergent if the considered finite element discretization satisfies an inf-sup condition.

By reasoning directly over library documentation and APIs, our agentic system dynamically assembles end-to-end simulations spanning state preparation, closed- and open-system dynamics, tensor-network methods, quantum control, quantum error correction, and quantum resource estimation. The developed system unifies traditionally distinct simulation paradigms behind a single natural-language interface.

These size-effects typically manifest themselves as a strengthening of the response in a form summarized as \"smaller is stiffer\". Moreover, the dynamical behavior of mechanical metamaterials is very remarkable, featuring unique phenomena such as dispersive behavior and band-gaps where elastic waves cannot propagate over specific frequency ranges. In these frequency ranges, the wavelength becomes gradually comparable to the unit-cell size, giving rise to microstructure related phenomena which become particularly visible in the reflection/transmission patterns where an incident wave hits the metamaterial's interfaces. This raises the question of whether the static size-effects and dynamic reflection/transmission patterns are correlated.\n  In this work, we investigate the interaction of the static size-effects and the dynamic scattering response of mechanical metamaterials by employing the relaxed micromorphic model. We introduce a two-stage optimization procedure to identify the material parameters. In the first stage, the static material parameters are identified by exploiting the static size-effects through a least squares fitting procedure based on the total energy. The dynamic parameters are determined in the second stage by fitting the dispersion curves of the relaxed micromorphic model to those of the fully discretized microstructure. At this second stage, we assess the results obtained by fitting the dispersion curves in one and in two propagation directions, for both the relaxed micromorphic model (RMM) with curvature and its reduced counterpart (RRMM) without curvature.\n  The full abstract is presented in the paper."}

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework."}

In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction."}

Here, 'nonlocal' means that the velocity of the conservation law depends on an integral term in space. Typically, the nonlocal term consists of integrating the solution in $L^{1}$, whereas here we will study the case when the solution is integrated in the $L^{p}$-norm. We consider even the case of the $L^{p}$ metric when $p\\in (0,1)$ and establish, for an initial datum which is uniformly bounded away from zero, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We then demonstrate that there are also solutions to the initial datum being zero under more restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we investigate the singular limit, i.e., what happens when the nonlocal kernel converges to a Dirac distribution. Indeed, for the one-sided exponential kernel, we recover the (entropy) solution of the corresponding local conservation law for all $p\\in(0,\\infty)$ with further restrictions for $p\\in(0,1)$. This generalizes the celebrated singular limit result for nonlocal conservation laws for $p=1$ significantly and showcases the robustness of the approximation of local conservation laws by nonlocal ones. We investigate also the monotonicity of the solution when assuming that the initial datum is monotone. Finally, we prove the convergence of solutions for $p\\rightarrow 0$ on a small time horizon, resulting in a different kind of nonlocal conservation law.

We perform direct numerical simulations over a broad parameter space in incident sound pressure level (ISPL), Strouhal number (St), and Reynolds number (Re). Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) yields energy-ranked coherent structures at each frequency, from which we construct mode-by-mode fields for spectral kinetic energy (KE) and viscous loss (VL) components to examine the mechanisms of acoustic absorption. At ISPL=150dB, the acoustic-hydrodynamic energy conversion is highest when the acoustic displacement amplitude is comparable to the slit thickness, corresponding to a Keulegan-Carpenter number of order unity. In this regime, the oscillatory boundary layer undergoes periodic separation, resulting in vortex shedding that dominates acoustic damping. VL accounts for 20-60% of the KE contribution. For higher acoustic frequencies, the confinement of the Stokes layer produces X-shaped near-slit modes, reducing the total energy input by approximately 50%. The influence of Re depends on amplitude. At ISPL=150dB, larger Re values correspond to suppressed broadband fluctuations and sharpened harmonic peaks. At ISPL = 120dB, the boundary layers remain attached, vortex shedding is weak, absorption monotonically scales with viscosity, and the Re- and St-dependencies become comparable. Across all conditions, more than 99% of the VL is confined to a compact region surrounding the slit mouth. The KE-VL spectra describe parameter regimes that enhance or suppress acoustic damping in slit geometries, providing a physically interpretable basis for acoustic-based design."}

Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions."}

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."}

Distinct from Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed node activations and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) featuring learnable edge activations, SNs utilize shared, learnable splines (monotonic and general) within structured blocks incorporating explicit shift parameters and mixing weights. Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints. We demonstrate empirically that composing these blocks into deep networks leads to highly parameter and memory-efficient models, discuss theoretical motivations, and compare SNs with related architectures (MLPs, KANs, and networks with learnable node activations)."}

In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."}

This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $λ(ρ)=ρ^β$ with $β> 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity."}

Previous approaches relied on approximation schemes and/or symmetry assumptions, which typically yield to compact embeddings and may lead to solutions that are not at the ground state energy level. In contrast, neither approximation arguments nor symmetry assumptions are employed in the paper to obtain a ground state solution.

Finally, we show that nonradial solutions exist whenever $N \\geq 4$; in particular, this settles a previously open problem in the case $N=5$."}

In this paper, we study streets of hollow vortices, which are solutions to the free boundary $2$-d irrotational incompressible Euler equations. Each vortex core is a region of constant pressure in the complement of the fluid domain with a nonzero circulation around it. We prove that any non-degenerate singly-periodic point vortex configuration can be ``desingularized'' to create a global curve of solutions to the steady hollow vortex street problem, and we further characterize the types of singular behavior that can develop as one transverses the curve to its extreme. As specific examples, we study von Kármán vortex streets, translating vortex arrays, and a two-pair (2P) configuration. Our method is based on analytic global bifurcation theory and adapts the desingularization technique of Chen, Walsh, and Wheeler to the periodic setting."}

Due to complex function approach all required electromechanical parameters are presented through vector-functions analytic in the whole complex plane except the crack region. The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region."}

We introduce a new approach to use the geometric completeness to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of polar sets of potentials of nonnegative Radon measures for sub-Laplacians in homogeneous Carnot groups. Our approach relies on inequalities that are analogous to the classic integral inequalities about Riesz potentials in Euclidean spaces. Our approach also uses extensions of some of geometric measure theory to homogeneous Carnot groups and the polar coordinates with horizontal radial curves constructed by Balogh and Tyson for polarizable Carnot groups. As consequences, we develop applications of potentials for sub-Laplacians in CR geometry, quaternionic CR geometry, and octonionic CR geometry."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this work, we investigate the well-posedness, stabilization, and boundary controllability of a linear Rao-Nakra type sandwich beam. The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities."}

A novel multivalued feedback control strategy is proposed, which synthesizes the frequency Lyapunov method (introduced by Xiang [41]) with the sign multivalued operator. This methodology connects Lyapunov-based stability analysis with spectral inequalities, while the inclusion of the sign operator ensures robustness against the disturbance. The closed-loop system is governed by a differential inclusion, for which well-posedness is proved via the theory of maximal monotone operators. This approach not only guarantees exponential stabilization but also circumvents the need for explicit disturbance modeling or estimation."}

This results in a new definition of the Brakke flow, as that of a space-time measure which satisfies the Brakke inequality in a distributional sense. Each such space-time measure corresponds to a class of equivalent (classical) Brakke flows, thus yielding an equivalence between the classical definitions of the Brakke flow, and this new definition. Moreover, we prove that the mean curvature vector, density, and tangent map along the flow, are all measurable with respect to this space-time weight measure."}

We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds."}

As the coefficients are allowed to be non-coercive, our framework encompasses a much broader scope than variational settings. To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of Itô--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting."}

Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known Itô versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems."}
