The learnable scaling adjusts the amplitudes of the multiscale random Fourier features, while the cross-attention residual structure provides an input-dependent mechanism to emphasize the most informative scales. As a result, the proposed design accelerates high-frequency convergence relative to comparable baselines built on the same multiscale bank.

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators.

This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $\u03bb(\u03c1)=\u03c1^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2> 4/3$.
