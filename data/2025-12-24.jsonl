The proposed framework ensures high order temporal accuracy through the use of Implicit Explicit Runge Kutta methods, which provide stability and efficiency in stiff regimes, while spatial resolution is enhanced by combining finite difference WENO reconstructions with high order central difference approximations. In the appropriate asymptotic limit, the scheme reduces to a high order finite difference formulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, thereby guaranteeing physical consistency of the numerical approximation with the limit model. To corroborate the theoretical findings, a set of numerical experiments is performed on two dimensional benchmark problems, which confirm the accuracy, stability, and versatility of the method across different flow regimes."}

The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs.

It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages."}

Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures."}

To address these limitations, we perform energy-resolved mixed quantum/classical (QM/MM) ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) of neutral 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, EMI-BF4, colliding with Au extractor surfaces with impact energies from 10 to 100 eV to resolve fragment species spectra, charge states, kinetic energy partitioning, and scattering geometry. The simulations reveal a three-stage sequence with impact energy: the low energy regime, 10 to 20 eV, which favors ionic dissociation, intermediate energy regime, between 30 to 40 eV, opens a neutralization window, and high energy regime, greater than 50 eV, drives covalent fragmentation into many light products with mixed charge states. Fractional energy distributions show a transition from few-body, energy-concentrated outcomes in the low energy regime to many-body, energy-dispersed outcomes in the high energy regime. Deflection angle distributions exhibit a strong mass-to-angle anti-correlation such that heavier fragments favor small deflection, whereas lighter fragments populate larger deflection angles. The fraction of transient metastables peaks near 50 eV, coinciding with abundant neutral fragment production. Importantly, neutral bombardment still produces charged secondaries at the target even when the upstream ion plume is fully suppressed by a decelerating electrode. These findings provide a basis for de-biasing facility measurements by pairing tandem time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and residual gas analyzer with suppression-bias corrections to inform the design of electrospray thrusters that reduce interception and contamination on extractor surfaces."}

This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments."}

We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_φ-α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $α$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $α$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\\infty} \\cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(ε,σ)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $σ\\in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations."}

This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method.

For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster.

We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfvénic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes.

We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $δ(ζ)$ cannot satisfy both that \\(-δ(ζ)\\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \\((-\\infty,1)\\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure.

Although this method is efficient in practice, its computational complexity is superlinear in the number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a variant of the Fast Diagonalization method that can exploit the Fast Fourier Transformation.

Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline.

We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve.

In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent.

According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene."}

Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \\textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P.

This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method.

However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \\emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics."}

This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows.

Following a seminal work by Tello and Winkler, a logistic damping term is added in this PDE and local well-posedness of mild solutions is proven. When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$."}

We perform variational energy minimization with respect to a quantum annealing Hamiltonian and utilize randomness by embedding the approaches in the metaheuristic iterated local search (ILS). The resulting quantum-inspired ILS algorithms are benchmarked on maximum cut problems of up to 50000 variables. We show that they can outperform traditional (M)PS methods, classical ILS, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and other variational quantum-inspired solvers."}

We give first order necessary conditions of optimality. A stochastic Pontryagin principle can be recovered in the case that the diffusion doesn't depend on the control. We give several applications, most notably for stochastic porous media equations in the Lipschitz case."}
