The present work demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic to the structure of the finite element spaces themselves. In particular, it is shown to be closely connected to the standard $L^2$-projection of derivatives, which possesses a super-approximation property exclusively for odd polynomial degrees. We also examine the implications of this feature for an energy-conservative Galerkin approximation of the regularized long-wave equation where the energy is a cubic functional. Although the resulting scheme conserves both mass and energy, we further show that the impulse is approximated with high accuracy, and we establish {\\em a priori} error bounds for the associated semi-discrete formulation."}

This framework allows one to consistently incorporate effects beyond the fixed background approximation, such as depletion and backreaction, without assuming any particular field strength or intensity regime.\n  Abstract We further demonstrate how the conventional generating functional with a prescribed background field emerges as a limiting case, corresponding to fixed coherent state boundary conditions. The path integral representation is then obtained as a reformulation of the same underlying Heisenberg picture amplitudes, providing a unified view of operator-based and functional approaches.\n  Abstract Our results establish a general and intensity-independent foundation for QED with coherent background fields, within which the standard formulations of strong-field QED arise as well-defined special cases."}

When pure Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the displacement, the leading block of the resulting algebraic system becomes almost singular in the nearly incompressible (locking) regime, hindering efficient iterative solution. To overcome this, the system is reformulated as a three-field problem with an inherent regularization that maintains the original solution while ensuring nonsingularity. Analysis shows that both the minimal residual (MINRES) and generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods, when preconditioned with inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners, achieve convergence independent of mesh size and the locking parameter for the regularized system. Similar theoretical results are established for the situation with displacement subject to mixed boundary conditions, even without regularization. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D confirm the benefits of regularization under pure Dirichlet conditions and the robustness of the preconditioners with respect to mesh size and the locking parameter in both boundary condition scenarios.

Here, we employ our unified multiphysics model that reproduces laser-solid interaction dynamics with accuracy exceeding 95% over a broad range of short- and ultrashort-pulse conditions. Using this model, we derive statistically validated scaling laws and probability maps that correlate proton, carbon, and oxygen ion cutoff energies, beam divergences, and ionization states to a wide set of laser and target parameters, including pulse duration, laser power, laser beam spot, target thickness, prepulse-main pulse interval, contrast, laser wavelength, and polarization. Continuous beam properties (cutoff energies and beam divergences) are described using multivariate regression with cross-validation, while discrete ionization states are analyzed using classification and regression tree (CART) methods, enabling nonlinear and threshold-dependent behavior to be captured.

However, we focus on the Hamiltonian formulation here mostly. We derive and study convergence of the associated abstract but scalar Hamilton-Jacobi equations, defined in space of probability measures. There is an infinite dimensional singular averaging structure within these equations. We develop an indirect variational approach to apply finite dimensional weak K.A.M. theory to such infinite dimensional setting here. With a weakly interacting particle assumption, the averaging step only involves that of individual particles, which is implicitly but rigorously treated using the weak K.A.M. theory. Consequently, we can close the above mentioned averaging step by identifying limiting Hamiltonian, and arrive at a rigorous convergence result on solutions of the nonlinear PDEs in space of probability measures.\n  In technical development parts of the paper, we devise new viscosity solution techniques regarding projection of equations with a submetry structure in state space, multi-scale convergence for certain abstract Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces, as well as comparison principles for equations in space of probability measures.

GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $α$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $α$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach.

A benchmark with previous simulations at constant impurity fraction has been provided for three H-modes, spanning different plasma current and magnetic field values. For a scenario, additional simulations have been performed to account for uncertainties in the modeling assumptions. The predictions are nearly insensitive to changes in the top of pedestal W concentrations. Varying the Ar pedestal concentration has shown a small effect on the impurity peaking and nearly constant fusion gain values, due to multiple effects on pedestal pressure, main ion dilution and density peaking.

Nanoflares analyzed in this study were generated self-consistently via prescribed photospheric motions in a 3D multi-strand simulation of a subset of active region magnetic flux. Energies and durations were quantified using three distinct methods. In this study, we investigated the correlation between nanoflare energies (E) and delays ($τ_D$) using two non-parametric, rank-based statistical tests. Across all methods, results consistently show little to no correlation. This is further supported by the distribution of the exponent $α$ in the assumed relation $E \\propto τ_D^α$, which peaks near zero, and by broad delay distributions within fixed energy bins. These findings are irrespective of whether delays are correlated with the energy of the preceding or subsequent event. They also hold for a subset of high-energy nanoflares. The absence of correlation suggests that nanoflare onset is not solely determined by a critical value of magnetic stress and may involve triggering by other events, perhaps related to a locally complex topology."}

In the shear-dominated regime, the flow is characterised by small-scale structures such as near-wall streaks. As buoyancy becomes comparable to shear, streamwise-oriented large-scale rolls emerge and span the full channel height. At higher Rayleigh numbers, buoyancy dominates and the rolls fragment, giving rise to a convection-cell-dominated regime. Short-time-averaged flow fields show that streamwise rolls transport low-speed fluid from the bottom wall towards the upper boundary, forming laterally extended low-speed regions, while roll fragmentation induces upstream low-speed regions near the upper boundary. Both mechanisms locally reduce the near-surface mean velocity, leading to a velocity dip in which the maximum mean streamwise velocity is located below the upper boundary. Consistent with the mean momentum budget, the near-surface region exhibits a large-scale Reynolds shear stress that exceeds the local total shear stress, implying a negative viscous contribution and a reversal of the mean velocity gradient. To model this behaviour, we propose a model based on a balance between buoyancy and shear production with dissipation, incorporating a linear wall-normal profile for the Reynolds shear stress, a wall-normal-independent buoyancy-production term, and a decomposition of the dissipation into shear-induced and buoyancy-induced contributions.

In contrast with upwind fluxes, such as Rusanov, Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) or the exact Riemann solver (RS) numerical flux, centred ones do not consider in any way the structure of the Riemann problem at cell interfaces. Adopting centred numerical fluxes leads to a high level of flexibility of the resulting numerical schemes, for example in the context of complicated hyperbolic systems, for which RSs may be impossible to construct or computationally expensive.\n  The baseline framework adopted in this investigation is a FV semidiscrete approach with Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization, and results are reported up to order 7. Previous investigations involving the same framework have established that increasing the order of accuracy tends to decrease the differences in the results obtained through different numerical fluxes.

Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions."}

However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator."}

We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs.

The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity.

In the complex setting, the well-posedness of this problem was recently investigated in [W. Kim, M. Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions. In our study, it has already been observed that gaining existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is possible under a natural and less restrictive assumption on the complex-valued coefficients. Following this direction, we prove a global Caderón-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence. This paper is a contribution to the better understanding of solution behavior and may be viewed as part of a series of works aimed at extending regularity theory in the complex-valued setting."}

The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2%. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors."}

First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line.\n  The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry."}

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing."}
