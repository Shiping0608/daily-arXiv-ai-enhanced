In the shear-dominated regime, the flow is characterised by small-scale structures such as near-wall streaks. As buoyancy becomes comparable to shear, streamwise-oriented large-scale rolls emerge and span the full channel height. At higher Rayleigh numbers, buoyancy dominates and the rolls fragment, giving rise to a convection-cell-dominated regime. Short-time-averaged flow fields show that streamwise rolls transport low-speed fluid from the bottom wall towards the upper boundary, forming laterally extended low-speed regions, while roll fragmentation induces upstream low-speed regions near the upper boundary. Both mechanisms locally reduce the near-surface mean velocity, leading to a velocity dip in which the maximum mean streamwise velocity is located below the upper boundary. Consistent with the mean momentum budget, the near-surface region exhibits a large-scale Reynolds shear stress that exceeds the local total shear stress, implying a negative viscous contribution and a reversal of the mean velocity gradient. To model this behaviour, we propose a model based on a balance between buoyancy and shear production with dissipation, incorporating a linear wall-normal profile for the Reynolds shear stress, a wall-normal-independent buoyancy-production term, and a decomposition of the dissipation into shear-induced and buoyancy-induced contributions.

While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors.
