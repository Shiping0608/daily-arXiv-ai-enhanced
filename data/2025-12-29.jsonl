Within such heterogeneous media, the equilibrium equation governed by the divergence of the stress tensor is reduced to a vector-valued quasilinear partial differential equation, wherein significant gradients and nonlinearities are introduced into the governing constitutive relations by spatial density variations. To ensure that these localized field variables are accurately captured, an automated $hp$-refinement strategy is implemented so that element sizes ($h$) and polynomial degrees ($p$) are concurrently optimized. A dual-indicator approach is employed by the framework. In this approach, $h$-refinement is driven by the Kelly error estimator, which utilizes the jump of the normal derivative across element interfaces, while $p$-refinement is determined by the decay of Legendre-Fourier coefficients to assess the local smoothness of the solution. Optimal convergence rates are ensured by this dual-refinement strategy, particularly within the singular regions surrounding the crack tip where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated across three distinct loading regimes: pure tensile (Mode I), pure shear (Mode II), and mixed-mode loading. It is demonstrated through numerical simulations that the intricate interaction between the fracture process zone and the underlying material heterogeneities is effectively resolved by the $hp$-adaptive scheme. Furthermore, the influence of specific density-dependent constitutive relations on the resulting crack-tip stress fields and strain energy density distributions is analyzed in detail."}

The existence of a discrete solution to the stabilized virtual element problem is demonstrated using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. The error estimates are derived in the energy norm.

However, due to curvature variations and continuity limitations of the boundary surfaces, the Jacobian determinant of a Coons volume may locally vanish or become negative, resulting in a non-regular mapping. This undermines mesh quality and compromises the stability of subsequent numerical computations. Ensuring the regularity of Coons volumes is therefore critical for robust parametric modeling. This paper develops a systematic framework for analyzing and verifying the regularity of Coons volumes. We first derive a general sufficient condition applicable to arbitrary boundary parameterizations, independent of specific analytical forms. For Bézier-form Coons volumes, we introduce a criterion based on the Bézier coefficients of the Jacobian determinant, transforming the verification problem into checking the positivity of control coefficients. Furthermore, we construct a necessary condition by applying a subdivision strategy combined with the Bézier blossoming technique, ensuring that regularity is preserved in all subdomains. By integrating these conditions, we design an efficient verification algorithm whose correctness and computational performance are validated through numerical experiments. We observe that the regularity of a Coons volume is closely related to the geometric similarity of its opposite boundary surfaces. Moreover, through Bézier extraction, the algorithm is extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes of arbitrary topology. Numerical tests show that the method completes regularity verification in milliseconds, enabling real-time application."}

The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies."}

The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms."}

Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain.

It passes all existing statistical tests, except for the linear complexity test, which measures the ratio of the even-odd of the number of 1's among specific bits (and hence should not be important for most applications). Harase reported that MT19937 is rejected by some birthday-spacing tests, which are rather artificially designed. In this paper, we report that MT19937 fails in a natural test based on the distribution of run-lengths on which we found an identical value in the output 32-bit integers. The number of observations of the run-length 623 is some 40 times larger than the expectation (and than the numbers of the observations of 622 and 624, etc.), which implies that the corresponding p-value is almost 0.\n  We mathematically analyze the phenomena, and obtain a theorem which explains these failures. It seems not to be a serious defect of MT19937, because finding the defect requires astronomical efforts. Still, the phenomena should be reported to the academic society relating to pseudorandom number generation."}

The approach linearizes convection using an extrapolated (Oseen-type) convecting velocity, producing a linear advection operator at each time step. For this operator, the adjoint can be written exactly. Exploiting this exact adjoint yields a systematic derivative-transfer mechanism within the VMS closure. In particular, unresolved-scale contributions enter the weak form without spatial derivatives of the modeled fine-scale velocity. The resulting terms also avoid derivatives of coarse-scale residuals and stabilization parameters. This eliminates the boundary-condition-sensitive, case-by-case integrations by parts that often accompany nonlinear residual-based VMS implementations, and it simplifies implementation in low-order FEM settings.\n  The formulation is presented for a generalized linear convection operator encompassing three common advection forms (convective-, skew-symmetric- and divergence-form). Their numerical behavior is compared, along with the corresponding fully implicit nonlinear VMS counterparts. Because the method is linear by construction, each time step requires only one linear solve. Across the benchmark suite, this reduces wall-clock time by $2$--$4\\times$ relative to fully implicit nonlinear formulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Temporal convergence is verified, and validation is performed on standard problems including the lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at chord Reynolds number $6\\times 10^{6}$. Overall, the convective and the skew-symmetric forms remain robust across the test cases, whereas the divergence-form can become nonconvergent for problems with purely Dirichlet boundaries."}

This paper studies a weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space of dimension N, with N greater than p. The weight function belongs to a critical Lorentz class and decays at infinity. Under natural assumptions on the weight, we prove the existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of a positive principal eigenvalue and establish local first-order regularity of the associated eigenfunction. We analyze the dependence of the principal eigenvalue on the Robin parameter and recover the Neumann and Dirichlet limits as the parameter approaches zero and infinity, respectively. The far-field behavior of the eigenfunction exhibits a universal algebraic decay rate that is independent of the Robin parameter, while the near-boundary structure displays an explicit scaling with respect to the parameter. We further investigate the gradient behavior of the eigenfunction, showing the existence of a unique critical radius and providing quantitative bounds on both the critical radius and the boundary value in terms of the Robin parameter. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of unified gradient estimates that connect the near-boundary and far-field regions through a characteristic length scale determined by the Robin parameter, yielding a global description of how boundary effects penetrate into the exterior domain."}
