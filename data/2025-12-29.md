### [1] [An $hp$-adaptive finite element framework for static cracks: The impact of pointwise density variations on mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode fracture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21443)
*S. M. Mallikarjunaiah*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: An hp-adaptive FEM framework for analyzing static cracks in heterogeneous materials with pointwise density variations, using dual-indicator refinement for optimal convergence near crack tips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model static cracks in heterogeneous materials with complex density variations, where spatial density gradients introduce significant nonlinearities and localized field variables that require adaptive refinement for proper resolution.

Method: An automated hp-adaptive finite element framework with dual-indicator refinement: h-refinement driven by Kelly error estimator (using normal derivative jumps across element interfaces), and p-refinement determined by Legendre-Fourier coefficient decay to assess local solution smoothness.

Result: The method achieves optimal convergence rates, particularly in singular regions around crack tips where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. It effectively resolves interactions between fracture process zones and material heterogeneities across tensile, shear, and mixed-mode loading regimes.

Conclusion: The hp-adaptive framework successfully captures complex crack behavior in heterogeneous materials, providing detailed analysis of density-dependent constitutive relations on crack-tip stress fields and strain energy distributions.

Abstract: A robust $hp$-adaptive finite element framework is presented for the investigation of static cracks in materials characterized by complex, pointwise density variations. Within such heterogeneous media, the equilibrium equation governed by the divergence of the stress tensor is reduced to a vector-valued quasilinear partial differential equation, wherein significant gradients and nonlinearities are introduced into the governing constitutive relations by spatial density variations. To ensure that these localized field variables are accurately captured, an automated $hp$-refinement strategy is implemented so that element sizes ($h$) and polynomial degrees ($p$) are concurrently optimized. A dual-indicator approach is employed by the framework. In this approach, $h$-refinement is driven by the Kelly error estimator, which utilizes the jump of the normal derivative across element interfaces, while $p$-refinement is determined by the decay of Legendre-Fourier coefficients to assess the local smoothness of the solution. Optimal convergence rates are ensured by this dual-refinement strategy, particularly within the singular regions surrounding the crack tip where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated across three distinct loading regimes: pure tensile (Mode I), pure shear (Mode II), and mixed-mode loading. It is demonstrated through numerical simulations that the intricate interaction between the fracture process zone and the underlying material heterogeneities is effectively resolved by the $hp$-adaptive scheme. Furthermore, the influence of specific density-dependent constitutive relations on the resulting crack-tip stress fields and strain energy density distributions is analyzed in detail.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate approximation of integrals with generalized Laguerre or Laplace weights over high-dimensional domains, which arise in various applications like quantum physics, statistical mechanics, and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Prove upper and lower bounds for optimal quadrature convergence rates using sparse-grid quadratures with integration nodes on step hyperbolic corners (for ℝᵈ₊) or hyperbolic crosses (for ℝᵈ).

Result: Establishes theoretical bounds on convergence rates for optimal quadratures with n integration nodes for functions from generalized Laguerre/Laplace-weighted Sobolev spaces of mixed smoothness.

Conclusion: Sparse-grid quadratures on hyperbolic structures provide optimal convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals with generalized Laguerre/Laplace weights, addressing the curse of dimensionality through mixed smoothness assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stabilized virtual element method for Boussinesq equations with temperature-dependent parameters that avoids discrete inf-sup condition violations while being simpler to implement than existing methods.

Method: Conforming stabilized virtual element method with gradient-based local projection stabilization, equal-order virtual element approximations, separate stabilization terms without coupling between solution components.

Result: Well-posedness established for continuous problem, discrete solution existence proved via Brouwer fixed-point theorem, error estimates derived in energy norm, numerical examples confirm efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully handles temperature-dependent Boussinesq equations with advantages in implementation simplicity, computational efficiency, and theoretical soundness.

Abstract: This work presents a new conforming stabilized virtual element method for the generalized Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity. A gradient-based local projection stabilization method is introduced in the discrete formulation to circumvent the violation of the discrete inf-sup condition. The well-posedness of the continuous problem is established under sufficiently small datum. We derive a stabilized virtual element problem for the Boussinesq equation using equal-order virtual element approximations. The proposed method has several advantages, such as being more straightforward to implement, free from higher-order derivative terms, providing separate stabilization terms without introducing coupling between solution components, and minimizing the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom. The existence of a discrete solution to the stabilized virtual element problem is demonstrated using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. The error estimates are derived in the energy norm. Additionally, several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, confirming the theoretical results.

### [4] [Regularity analysis and verification of Coons volume mappings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21656)
*Yingying Yu,Yashu Liu,Jiaxuan Li,Xin Li,Ye Ji,Chungang Zhu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Systematic framework for analyzing and verifying regularity of Coons volumes with efficient algorithm achieving millisecond verification times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coons volumes are widely used in volumetric mesh generation and isogeometric analysis, but their Jacobian determinant can locally vanish or become negative due to boundary surface curvature variations, leading to non-regular mappings that undermine mesh quality and numerical stability.

Method: Developed a systematic framework with: 1) general sufficient condition for arbitrary boundary parameterizations, 2) Bézier-form criterion based on Jacobian determinant coefficients, 3) necessary condition using subdivision strategy with Bézier blossoming, and 4) integration into efficient verification algorithm extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes via Bézier extraction.

Result: Algorithm achieves millisecond verification times enabling real-time application, with correctness validated through numerical experiments. Regularity is found to be closely related to geometric similarity of opposite boundary surfaces.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust parametric modeling for Coons volumes with efficient regularity verification, extending to arbitrary topology B-spline volumes while maintaining computational performance suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: The Coons volume provides a classical approach for constructing three-dimensional parametric mappings via boundary surface interpolation and is widely employed in volumetric mesh generation, computer-aided geometric design, and isogeometric analysis. However, due to curvature variations and continuity limitations of the boundary surfaces, the Jacobian determinant of a Coons volume may locally vanish or become negative, resulting in a non-regular mapping. This undermines mesh quality and compromises the stability of subsequent numerical computations. Ensuring the regularity of Coons volumes is therefore critical for robust parametric modeling. This paper develops a systematic framework for analyzing and verifying the regularity of Coons volumes. We first derive a general sufficient condition applicable to arbitrary boundary parameterizations, independent of specific analytical forms. For Bézier-form Coons volumes, we introduce a criterion based on the Bézier coefficients of the Jacobian determinant, transforming the verification problem into checking the positivity of control coefficients. Furthermore, we construct a necessary condition by applying a subdivision strategy combined with the Bézier blossoming technique, ensuring that regularity is preserved in all subdomains. By integrating these conditions, we design an efficient verification algorithm whose correctness and computational performance are validated through numerical experiments. We observe that the regularity of a Coons volume is closely related to the geometric similarity of its opposite boundary surfaces. Moreover, through Bézier extraction, the algorithm is extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes of arbitrary topology. Numerical tests show that the method completes regularity verification in milliseconds, enabling real-time application.

### [5] [Factorized sparse approximate inverse preconditioning for singular M-matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21744)
*Katherina Bick,Reinhard Nabben*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: FSAI preconditioner works for singular irreducible M-matrices with specific nonzero pattern restrictions, producing non-singular, non-negative triangular factors and a preconditioned matrix that remains a singular M-matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Singular irreducible M-matrices arise in applications like discrete Markov chain modeling and graph Laplacians, but preconditioning these matrices requires special consideration due to their singular nature.

Method: Apply factorized sparse approximate inverse (FSAI) preconditioner to singular irreducible M-matrices with specific restrictions on the nonzero pattern to ensure stable construction.

Result: With proper nonzero pattern restrictions, FSAI is well-defined and produces non-singular, non-negative triangular matrices L_G and U_G. The preconditioned matrix L_G A U_G has positive diagonal entries and remains a singular M-matrix. A (1,2)-inverse is computed for the complete nonzero pattern.

Conclusion: FSAI preconditioner can be successfully applied to singular irreducible M-matrices with appropriate nonzero pattern restrictions, preserving important matrix properties while enabling effective preconditioning for applications like Markov chains and graph Laplacians.

Abstract: Here we consider the factorized sparse approximate inverse (FSAI) preconditioner. We apply the FSAI preconditioner to singular irreducible M-matrices. These matrices arise e.g. in discrete Markov chain modeling or as graph Laplacians. We show, that there are some restrictions on the nonzero pattern needed for a stable construction of the FSAI preconditioner in this case. With these restrictions FSAI is well-defined. Moreover, we proved that the FSAI preconditioner shares some important properties with the original system. The lower triangular matrix $L_G$ and the upper triangular matrix $U_G$, generated by FSAI, are non-singular and non-negative. The diagonal entries of $L_GAU_G$ are positive and $L_GAU_G$, the preconditioned matrix, is a singular M-matrix. Even more, we establish that a (1,2)-inverse is computed for the complete nonzero patter.

### [6] [Optimal-Transport Stability of Inverse Point-Source Problems for Elliptic and Parabolic Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21821)
*Lingyun Qiu,Shenwen Yu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper establishes quantitative stability estimates using optimal transport cost for inverse point-source problems governed by elliptic and parabolic PDEs with spatially varying coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified analytical framework connecting inverse source problems and optimal transport theory, providing OT-based stability theory for inverse source problems governed by PDEs with spatially varying coefficients.

Method: Represent Kantorovich dual potential as boundary functional of adjoint solutions, linking OT geometry with boundary observations. Use complex geometric optics solutions for elliptic case and controllable adjoint solutions for parabolic case to enforce pointwise constraints and transfer interior information to boundary.

Result: Under mild regularity and separation assumptions, obtain stability estimates: OT cost between admissible point-source measures bounded by L² norm of boundary data differences for both elliptic and parabolic cases.

Conclusion: The results provide a unified framework connecting inverse source problems and optimal transport, establishing OT-based stability theory for inverse source problems governed by PDEs with spatially varying coefficients.

Abstract: We establish quantitative global stability estimates, formulated in terms of optimal transport (OT) cost, for inverse point-source problems governed by elliptic and parabolic equations with spatially varying coefficients. The key idea is that the Kantorovich dual potential can be represented as a boundary functional of suitable adjoint solutions, thereby linking OT geometry with boundary observations. In the elliptic case, we construct complex geometric optics solutions that enforce prescribed pointwise constraints, whereas in the parabolic case we employ controllable adjoint solutions that transfer interior information to the boundary. Under mild regularity and separation assumptions, we obtain estimates of the form \[ \mathcal{T}_c(μ,ν) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partialΩ)} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{T}_c(μ,ν) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partialΩ\times[0,T])}, \] where $μ$ and $ν$ are admissible point-source measures. These results provide a unified analytical framework connecting inverse source problems and optimal transport, and establish OT-based stability theory for inverse source problems governed by partial differential equations with spatially varying coefficients.

Main category: math.NA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop improved stratified sampling schemes for importance sampling scenarios, addressing the need for better error bounds in multivariate integration problems, particularly in Sobolev spaces.

Method: Introduces parametric equivolume partitions, uses weighted discrepancy reduction lemma to relate weighted Lp-discrepancy to standard Lp-discrepancy, applies exact formulas for p=2 and dyadic chaining techniques for p>2.

Result: Obtains explicit bounds for p=2 using exact discrepancy formulas, derives probabilistic bounds for p>2, demonstrates improved performance over classical jittered sampling in importance sampling scenarios.

Conclusion: Parametric stratified sampling schemes provide superior error estimates for multivariate integration in Sobolev spaces compared to classical methods, with theoretical results validated by numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper studies the expected $L_p$-discrepancy ($2 \leq p < \infty$) for stratified sampling schemes under importance sampling. We introduce a parametric family of equivolume partitions $Ω_{θ,\sim}$ and leverage recent exact formulas for the expected $L_2$-discrepancy \cite{xian2025improved}. Our main contribution is a weighted discrepancy reduction lemma that relates weighted $L_p$-discrepancy to standard $L_p$-discrepancy with explicit constants depending on the weight function. For $p=2$, we obtain explicit bounds using the exact discrepancy formulas. For $p>2$, we derive probabilistic bounds via dyadic chaining techniques. The results yield uniform error estimates for multivariate integration in Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}^1(K)$ and $F^*_{d,q}$, demonstrating improved performance over classical jittered sampling in importance sampling scenarios. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical advantages of parametric stratified sampling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the dual functionals (blossom and divided difference operator) from polynomial spaces to various non-polynomial spline spaces including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and Müntz splines, establishing similar relationships between them.

Method: Defines an extended non-polynomial homogeneous blossom for a wide collection of spline spaces, then demonstrates the relationship between non-polynomial divided differences and this blossom.

Result: Shows that the relationship between divided differences and blossoms in polynomial approximation theory extends to non-polynomial spline spaces, establishing analogous formulas and identities.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes the dual functional framework from polynomials to various non-polynomial spline spaces, maintaining the fundamental relationship between blossoms and divided differences across different approximation spaces.

Abstract: Two notable examples of dual functionals in approximation theory and computer-aided geometric design are the blossom and the divided difference operator. Both of these dual functionals satisfy a similar set of formulas and identities. Moreover, the divided differences of polynomials can be expressed in terms of the blossom. In this paper, an extended non-polynomial homogeneous blossom for a wide collection of spline spaces, including trigonometric splines, hyperbolic splines, and special Müntz spaces of splines, is defined. It is shown that there is a relation between the non-polynomial divided difference and the blossom, which is analogous to the polynomial case.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: eFEONet: An enriched Finite Element Operator Network that uses specialized basis functions based on singular perturbation theory to solve singularly perturbed PDEs with sharp layers, achieving accurate results with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML methods for PDEs struggle with singularly perturbed problems that have sharp boundary/interior layers, requiring expensive adaptive mesh refinement for training data and often failing without extensive resolution.

Method: eFEONet augments operator-learning framework with specialized enrichment basis functions that encode the asymptotic structure of layer solutions, guided by classical singular perturbation theory. Can operate with minimal supervision or even data-free.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments on representative problems with both boundary and interior layers, and includes rigorous convergence analysis.

Conclusion: eFEONet provides an effective approach for solving challenging singularly perturbed PDEs with sharp transitions, achieving accurate approximations without relying on large datasets or extensive resolution requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new possibilities for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet robust performance in challenging regimes remains limited. In particular, singularly perturbed differential equations exhibit sharp boundary or interior layers with rapid transitions, where standard ML surrogates often fail without extensive resolution. Generating training data for such problems is also costly, as accurate reference solutions typically require massive adaptive mesh refinement. In this work, we propose eFEONet, an enriched Finite Element Operator Network tailored to singularly perturbed problems. Guided by classical singular perturbation theory, eFEONet augments the operator-learning framework with specialized enrichment basis functions that encode the asymptotic structure of layer solutions. This design enables accurate approximation of sharp transitions without relying on large datasets, and can operate with minimal supervision-or even in a data-free manner under appropriate settings. We further provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on representative problems featuring both boundary and interior layers.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves finite-time shock formation for compressible Euler equations on the 2D sphere S², overcoming geometric challenges through modified modulation methods and shock-adapted coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand shock formation in compressible fluids on curved manifolds, specifically the 2D sphere S², which presents different geometric challenges compared to flat Euclidean space R².

Method: Modified modulation method with time-dependent coordinates: 1) time-dependent rotation of S², 2) stereographic projection, 3) straightening the shock front, 4) constructing shock-adapted coordinates for self-similar analysis, and 5) bootstrap argument for global well-posedness.

Result: Established global well-posedness for the self-similar system and demonstrated finite-time shock formation for compressible Euler equations on S² after transferring results back to the original physical system.

Conclusion: Successfully proved finite-time shock formation on curved manifolds (S²) by developing geometric coordinate transformations that adapt to shock formation, extending shock theory beyond flat Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the finite-time shock formation for the compressible Euler equations on the two-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. In contrast to the flat Euclidean case $\mathbb{R}^2$, the geometry of $\mathbb S^2$ imposes new difficulties, and the fluid dynamics are affected by the curved background. To overcome these challenges, we modify the existing modulation method and employ a set of carefully constructed, time-dependent coordinates that precisely track the shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$. In particular, we first perform a time-dependent rotation of $\mathbb S^2$, then apply the stereographic projection to the sphere, straighten the steepening shock front, and finally construct shock-adapted coordinates. In the shock-adapted coordinates, the compressible Euler equations on $\mathbb{S}^2$ can be recast into a form suitable for self-similar analysis. Within this framework, we implement a detailed bootstrap argument and establish global well-posedness for the self-similar system. After transferring these results back to the original physical system, we thereby demonstrate the finite-time shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand concentration phenomena in nonlinear elliptic equations with variable coefficients and eigenfunction forcing terms, particularly how solutions can develop clustering concentration layers along specific geometric curves.

Method: The authors study an Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem with variable coefficient elliptic operator and eigenfunction forcing. They identify a curve Γ as a non-degenerate critical point of a geometric functional involving the eigenfunction and Riemannian metric induced by the coefficient matrix. Using analytical techniques, they prove existence of solutions with concentration layers.

Result: There exists a sequence t = t_l → +∞ such that the problem has solutions u_{t_l} with clustering concentration layers directed along the curve Γ.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a connection between geometric properties of curves (as critical points of a functional) and concentration phenomena in solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations with eigenfunction forcing, showing how solutions can concentrate along specific geometric structures.

Abstract: We consider the following Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem \begin{equation}\label{e50} \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -div (A(x)\nabla u)=|u|^p-t\mathbfΨ(x), &\mbox{in $Ω$,} \\ u=0, & \mbox{on $\partial Ω$}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $t>0$, $p>3$ and $\mathbfΨ$ is an eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue of the following operator \[\mathfrak{L}(u)=-div (A(x)\nabla u).\] Moreover, $A(x)=\{A_{ij}(x)\}_{2\times 2}$ is a symmetric positive defined matrix function. Let $Γ\subset Ω$ be a closed curve and also a non-degenerate critical point of the functional \[\mathcal{K}(Γ)=\int_Γ\mathbfΨ^{\frac{p+3}{2p}}dvol_{\mathfrak{g}},\] where $\mathfrak{g}(X,Y)=\langle A^*X,Y\rangle$ is a Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A^*$ is the adjoint matrix for $A$. We prove that there exists a sequence of $t=t_l\to +\infty$ such that this problem has solutions $u_{t_l}$ with clustering concentration layers directed along $Γ$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalized solutions have not been previously studied in the variable exponent setting, and standard scaling arguments from classical approaches are unavailable in this framework.

Method: Constrained variational framework to overcome lack of scaling arguments, establishing existence of ground state solutions, proving local regularity, and deriving a Pohozaev-type identity adapted to variable exponents.

Result: Existence of ground state solutions for normalized problems with variable exponents, proof that solutions are locally C^{1,α}, and derivation of a Pohozaev-type identity for variable exponent structure.

Conclusion: First successful study of normalized solutions in variable exponent setting, overcoming fundamental scaling limitations through variational methods and establishing new analytical tools including adapted Pohozaev identity.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate normalized solutions for nonlinear problems involving variable exponents. To the best of our knowledge, normalized solutions have not been previously studied in this setting, and our results appear to be new. A key difficulty is that the standard scaling argument, which is important in the classical normalized solution approach, is no longer available in the variable exponent setup. To address this, we work with a constrained variational framework and establish the existence of a ground state solution. We further show that these solutions are $C^{1,α}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Finally, we derive a Poho\v zaev-type identity adapted to the variable exponent structure in $\mathbb{R}^N$, which is used to prove that the solution is a ground state.

Result: Proved large data local well-posedness in low-regularity Sobolev spaces for skew mean curvature flow in dimension d≥2, with robust method for handling large data.

Conclusion: Developed comprehensive analytical framework for skew mean curvature flow that successfully handles large data problems through novel discretization, geometric constructions, fractional spaces, and gauge-independent uniqueness proofs.

Abstract: The skew mean curvature flow is an evolution equation for $d$ dimensional ma\-nifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ (or more generally, in a Riemannian manifold). It can be viewed as a Schrödinger analogue of the mean curvature flow, or alternatively as a quasilinear version of the Schrödinger Map equation. In this article, we prove large data local well-posedness in low-regularity Sobolev spaces for the skew mean curvature flow in dimension $d\geq 2$. This is achieved by introducing several new ideas: (i) a time discretization method to establish the existence of smooth solutions, (ii) constructing the orthonormal frame by a parallel transport method and a lifting criterion, (iii) introducing intrinsic fractional function spaces $X^s\subset H^s$ on a noncompact manifold for any $s>\frac{d}{2}$, such that the $X^s$-norm of the second fundamental form can be propagated well along the quasilinear Schrödinger flow, (iv) deriving a difference equation to prove the uniqueness result for solutions $F\in C^2$, which is independent in the choices of gauge. Our method turns out to be more robust for large data problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spectral theory of p-Laplacian is well-developed for Dirichlet/Neumann conditions but the transitional Robin regime on exterior domains remains largely unexplored, creating a gap in understanding boundary condition transitions in exterior domains.

Method: Study weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on exterior of unit ball in Euclidean space (N>p), with weight function in critical Lorentz class decaying at infinity. Use analytical techniques to prove existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation properties.

Result: Proved existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of positive principal eigenvalue with local first-order regularity of eigenfunction. Showed Neumann and Dirichlet limits as Robin parameter approaches zero and infinity. Established universal algebraic decay rate in far-field independent of Robin parameter, and explicit near-boundary scaling with parameter. Derived unified gradient estimates connecting near-boundary and far-field regions.

Conclusion: The work provides comprehensive analysis of Robin boundary conditions for p-Laplacian on exterior domains, establishing fundamental spectral properties and revealing how boundary effects penetrate exterior domains through characteristic length scale determined by Robin parameter, bridging near-boundary and far-field behavior.

Abstract: The spectral theory of the p-Laplacian is well developed for classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, but the transitional Robin regime on exterior domains remains largely unexplored. This paper studies a weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space of dimension N, with N greater than p. The weight function belongs to a critical Lorentz class and decays at infinity. Under natural assumptions on the weight, we prove the existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of a positive principal eigenvalue and establish local first-order regularity of the associated eigenfunction. We analyze the dependence of the principal eigenvalue on the Robin parameter and recover the Neumann and Dirichlet limits as the parameter approaches zero and infinity, respectively. The far-field behavior of the eigenfunction exhibits a universal algebraic decay rate that is independent of the Robin parameter, while the near-boundary structure displays an explicit scaling with respect to the parameter. We further investigate the gradient behavior of the eigenfunction, showing the existence of a unique critical radius and providing quantitative bounds on both the critical radius and the boundary value in terms of the Robin parameter. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of unified gradient estimates that connect the near-boundary and far-field regions through a characteristic length scale determined by the Robin parameter, yielding a global description of how boundary effects penetrate into the exterior domain.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Inverse random potential problem for Schrödinger equation: determining covariance operator's principal symbol from multi-frequency backscattered far-field patterns using probabilistic stability estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inverse problem of determining random potentials in Schrödinger equations, which is important for applications like quantum mechanics, wave propagation in random media, and material characterization where potentials have stochastic properties.

Method: 1) Direct problem: Investigates meromorphic continuation of resolvent for Schrödinger operator with rough potentials, establishes well-posedness of direct scattering problem, and develops Born series expansion. 2) Inverse problem: Derives probabilistic stability estimate using ergodicity theory and quantitative analytic continuation principle to determine principal symbol of covariance operator from single realization of multi-frequency backscattered far-field patterns.

Result: Provides rigorous probabilistic stability estimate for determining the principal symbol of the covariance operator of the random potential. The estimate quantifies the probability that the principal symbol can be quantitatively determined from a single realization of multi-frequency backscattered far-field data.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical framework for inverse random potential problems, demonstrating that statistical properties of random potentials (specifically the principal symbol of their covariance operator) can be recovered from scattering data with probabilistic guarantees, combining scattering theory with ergodicity and analytic continuation techniques.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse random potential problem for the Schrödinger equation. The random potential is assumed to be a generalized Gaussian random function, whose covariance operator is a classical pseudo-differential operator. For the direct problem, the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the Schrödinger operator with rough potentials is investigated, which yields the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem and a Born series expansion. For the inverse problem, we derive a probabilistic stability estimate for determining the principle symbol of the covariance operator of the random potential. The stability result provides an estimate of the probability for an event when the principle symbol can be quantitatively determined by a single realization of the multi-frequency backscattered far-field pattern. The analysis employs the ergodicity theory and quantitative analytic continuation principle.

TL;DR: The paper studies mixed local-nonlocal critical elliptic equations, proving existence, regularity, and qualitative properties of positive solutions including decay estimates and radial symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze mixed local and non-local critical elliptic equations with combined Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators, which arise in various physical and mathematical contexts, and to establish comprehensive solution properties.

Method: First shows existence and regularity of viscosity solutions using results from previous work (Su-Xu), then proves these are classical solutions for certain parameter ranges, and establishes qualitative properties including decay estimates and radial symmetry.

Result: Proves: 1) Weak solutions are viscosity solutions with regularity u∈C^α(R^n) for p∈(0,1) and u∈C^{2,β}(R^n) for p∈[1,2^*-1); 2) For p∈[1,2^*-1), viscosity solutions are classical; 3) Existence of positive solutions with decay estimates and radial symmetry.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a complete theory for mixed local-nonlocal critical elliptic equations, providing existence, regularity, and qualitative properties of solutions, with different regularity regimes depending on the exponent p.

Abstract: We consider the following mixed local and non-local critical elliptic equation: \begin{equation*}\label{0.1} \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} -Δu+(-Δ)^su=λh u^{p}+u^{2^*-1}, &\text{in}\,\, \mathbb{R}^n, u>0, &\text {in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^n, \lim\limits_{|x|\to\infty} u(x) = 0, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $n\geqslant4, \,\, p\in (0,2^*-1),\,\, 2^*:=\frac{2n}{n-2}$ and $h$ is a positive function. We first show the existence and regularity results of viscosity solutions to the above critical elliptic equation. More precisely, from \cite{Su-Xu} weak solutions are obtained and we prove they are indeed viscosity solutions and their regularity is: \( u \in C^α(\mathbb{R}^n) \) for $p\in(0,1);$ \( u \in C^{2,β}(\mathbb{R}^n) \) for $p\in [1, 2^*-1).$ Moreover, for $p\in [1, 2^*-1)$, these viscosity solutions are indeed classical ones and we then prove the existence of positive solutions with the qualitative properties such as the decay estimates and the radial symmetry.

*Dihang Guan,Hui He,Wenqing Hu,Jiaojiao Yang*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Random drift in reaction-diffusion equation causes both wave fronts to be pushed in negative direction, potentially propagating toward negative infinity when average drift is positive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how random drift affects wave propagation in reaction-diffusion systems with FKPP-type nonlinearity, particularly when the average drift is positive.

Method: Uses Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments and analysis of Feynman-Kac formula with probabilistic arguments.

Result: When average drift is positive, both asymptotic wave fronts (propagating to positive and negative directions) are pushed in the negative direction, potentially causing both to propagate toward negative infinity.

Conclusion: Random drift acts as an external field that shifts the quenched free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure, explaining the wave front formation mechanism.

Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.

*Zheng-Nan Hu,Jin Woo Jang,Zheng-An Yao,Yu-Long Zhou*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes a sharp quantitative estimate for the angular singularity in Boltzmann kernels from inverse power potentials, yielding optimal O(s) convergence rates for solutions to the homogeneous Boltzmann equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Jang-Kepka-Nota-Velázquez (2023) proved the limit of Boltzmann kernels B^s → ¼|v-v_*| as s→0 and weak convergence of solutions. However, they lacked quantitative convergence rates. This work aims to provide sharp quantitative estimates to establish optimal convergence rates for solutions.

Method: Develops a sharp quantitative estimate for the angular singularity: |b_s(θ) - ¼| ≤ C s θ^{-2-2s}. This estimate is then used to prove optimal O(s) convergence rates for solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with large initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces.

Result: Establishes the sharp quantitative bound for the angular singularity and proves that for any t∈[0,T], the solution satisfies f^s(t) = f^0(t) + O(s), quantified by the L^1_k norm for k≥2.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first sharp quantitative convergence rates for Boltzmann kernels arising from inverse power potentials, yielding optimal O(s) convergence for solutions to the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with large initial data.

Abstract: The inverse power potential $U(r)=r^{-1/s}, 0<s<1$, generates the Boltzmann kernel $B^{s}=|v-v_*|^{1-4s} b_s(θ)$ with an angular singularity as $θ\to 0$. Jang-Kepka-Nota-Velázquez (2023) proved the limit $B^{s}\to \frac14|v-v_*|$ as $s\to 0$, as well as weak convergence of solutions based on this kernel convergence. In this work we establish the following sharp quantitative estimate: $$ |b_s(θ)-\tfrac14| \le C\, s\,θ^{-2-2s}. $$ In particular, this sharp estimate yields the optimal $O(s)$ convergence rate for solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with large initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces; i.e., for any $t\in[0,T]$, we have $$f^s(t)=f^0(t)+O(s),$$ quantified by the $L^1_k$ norm for $k\ge 2.$

TL;DR: Spectral convergence of Laplace operator in 3D rod structures to 1D model as cross-section diameter ε→0, with boundary conditions preserved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how spectral properties of 3D thin structures (rods) with small cross-sections converge to simpler 1D models, which is important for modeling diffusion/vibrations in nonhomogeneous media with varying physical characteristics.

Method: Analyze Laplace operator in 3D rod structures with diameter O(ε), with Dirichlet/Neumann conditions on bases and Neumann on lateral boundary. Study spectral convergence as ε→0 using asymptotic analysis and Sobolev space techniques for low frequencies.

Result: Spectrum converges with conserved multiplicity to 1D spectral model with corresponding boundary conditions. The 1D model incorporates geometry of original 3D domain and can describe diffusion/vibrations in nonhomogeneous media.

Conclusion: Thin 3D rod structures can be effectively modeled by 1D spectral problems as cross-section becomes small, providing simplified models that preserve spectral properties while accounting for original geometry.

Abstract: We consider spectral problems for Laplace operator in 3D rod structures with a small cross section of diameter $O(\varepsilon)$, $\varepsilon$ being a positive parameter. The boundary conditions are Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) on the bases of this structure and Neumann on the lateral boundary. As $\varepsilon\to 0$, we show the convergence of the spectrum with conservation of the multiplicity towards that of a 1D spectral model with Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) boundary conditions. This 1D model may arise in diffusion or vibrations models of nonhomogeneous media with different physical characteristics and it takes into account the geometry of the 3D domain. We deal with the low frequencies and the approach to eigenfunctions in the suitable Sobolev spaces is also outlined.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Helicon plasma sources are crucial for various applications (material treatment, space propulsion, fusion), but the physical processes governing their ignition, transient ionization, and mode evolution remain incompletely understood.

Method: Developed a self-consistent, fully coupled multiphysics framework integrating Maxwell equations, electron energy transport, drift-diffusion kinetics, and heavy-species chemistry to capture complete spatiotemporal evolution of helicon discharges.

Result: Model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges. Reveals previously unresolved transient ionization stage with rapid density rise (~10^-4 s) and two-peak electron temperature structure. Characterizes transient RF energy redistribution during ignition and shows sensitivity to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency.

Conclusion: Provides a unified picture of ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establishes a predictive tool for design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.

Abstract: Helicon plasma sources play a central role in applications ranging from material treatment to space propulsion and fusion, yet the physical processes governing their ignition, transient ionization, and mode evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we develop a self-consistent, fully coupled multiphysics framework that integrates Maxwell equations, electron energy transport, drift-diffusion kinetics, and heavy-species chemistry to capture the complete spatiotemporal evolution of helicon discharges. The model reproduces experimental measurements across pressure, magnetic field, and frequency ranges, and reveals a previously unresolved transient ionization stage characterized by a rapid density rise within ~10-4 s, accompanied by a two-peak electron temperature structure that governs the formation of the dense plasma core. By tracking the RF power flow and field topology, we characterize the transient redistribution of RF energy during ignition. A short-lived phase of localized energy deposition accompanies the onset of ionization, followed by an evolution toward helicon-like field characteristics together with rapid density growth and profile restructuring. Systematic parametric scans further reveal the sensitivity of this mode-coupling process to gas pressure, magnetic field strength, and driving frequency. These results provide a unified picture of the ignition and mode-transition physics in helicon plasmas and establish a predictive tool for the design and optimization of RF plasma sources across space propulsion, manufacturing, and fusion technologies.

Motivation: The long-time asymptotics for the defocusing or focusing Manakov system under nonzero background remains an open problem that needs to be solved to understand the system's behavior at large times.

Method: Transform the solution into a 3×3 matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, then apply the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis to obtain asymptotic behavior in the space-time soliton region.

Result: The leading order solution takes the form of a modulated multisoliton. A unique dispersive correction term of order t^{-1/2} is discovered that doesn't exist in the scalar case, with explicit expression provided.

Conclusion: The paper successfully solves the open problem of long-time asymptotics for the defocusing Manakov system on nonzero background, revealing both the main soliton structure and a distinctive dispersive correction term absent in scalar cases.

Abstract: The Manakov system is a two-component nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The long-time asymptotics for the defocusing or focusing Manakov system under nonzero background still remains open. In this paper, we derive the long-time asymptotic formula for the solution of the defocusing Manakov system on nonzero boundary conditions and provide a detailed proof. The solution of the defocusing Manakov system on such nonzero background is first transformed into the solution of a $3 \times 3$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Then we demonstrate how to conduct the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis for this Riemann-Hilbert problem, thereby obtaining the long-time asymptotic behavior of the solution in the space-time soliton region. In this region, the leading order of the solution takes the form of a modulated multisoliton. Apart from the error term, we also discover that the defocusing Manakov system has a dispersive correction term of order $t^{-1/2}$, but this term does not exist in the scalar case, and we provide the explicit expression for this dispersion term.

### [33] [Lax pairs for BKM hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22064)
*Andrey Yu. Konyaev,Vladimir S. Matveev*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper constructs Lax pairs for BKM integrable PDE systems, providing unified Lax representations for known hierarchies (Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, Marvan-Pavlov) and new ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The BKM equations are recently introduced (2023) integrable PDE systems that encompass many known integrable systems as special cases. However, Lax pairs for these general BKM systems were not yet constructed, limiting the ability to apply integrability techniques and understand the underlying algebraic structure.

Method: The authors construct Lax pairs for BKM systems by relating them to a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line whose potential depends rationally on the spectral parameter. This provides a unified framework for obtaining Lax representations.

Result: Successfully constructed Lax pairs for the general BKM integrable systems. This construction yields Lax pairs for many integrable hierarchies including Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, and Marvan-Pavlov systems, as well as new previously unknown integrable hierarchies.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive Lax pair construction for the BKM integrable systems, unifying the integrability structure of many known and new PDE hierarchies through a Sturm-Liouville operator framework with rational spectral parameter dependence.

Abstract: We construct Lax pairs for the recently (2023) introduced integrable PDE systems known as the BKM equations. As many known and previously studied integrable systems are special cases of the BKM systems, our construction provides Lax pairs for many integrable hierarchies, including previously studied ones such as Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, and Marvan-Pavlov, as well as new ones. The corresponding pair is related to a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line whose potential depends rationally on the spectral parameter.

Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schrödinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology. This work contributes to the growing field of physics-informed machine learning for quantum eigenproblems, providing insights into the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and neural architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of post-Hopf algebroids, generalizing the pre-Hopf algebroids introduced in [Bronasco, Laurent, 2025] in the study of exotic aromatic S-series. We construct action post-Hopf algebroids through actions of post-Hopf algebras. We show that the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie-Rinehart algebra (post-Lie algebroid) is naturally a post-Hopf algebroid. As a byproduct, we construct the free post-Lie-Rinehart algebra using a magma algebra with a linear map to the derivation Lie algebra of a commutative associative algebra. Applications in geometric numerical integration on manifolds are given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-scale porous media simulations often have under-resolved regions at practical computational resolutions, requiring accurate modeling of unresolved contributions for reliable flow predictions.

Method: Extended pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model with controllable surface tension while maintaining constant interface thickness; developed local constitutive relations for sub-cell fluid components; implemented tensorial resistivity model aligned with principal axes from porosity field analysis.

Result: Benchmark tests including practical rock geometries validate improved transient interface dynamics, accurate capture of irreducible fluid components, and correct directional effects in under-resolved structures.

Conclusion: The enhanced model successfully handles diverse porous structures and captures detailed fluid behavior in under-resolved regions, improving accuracy for multi-scale porous media simulations.

Abstract: Multi-component fluid flow simulations in multi-scale porous structures often involve regions that are under-resolved at practical computational resolutions. Accurately capturing the contributions from these unresolved regions is critical. Previous studies proposed a model to account for viscous and capillary forces in under-resolved regions, showing permeability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability comparable to fully resolved high-resolution cases. In this study, we extend the model to handle diverse structures and capture detailed fluid behavior. We introduce controllable surface tension in a pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model while keeping interface thickness and spurious currents constant, improving interface dynamics resolution. A method is developed to capture residual fluid components smaller than cell size using local constitutive relations, including absolute and relative permeability and capillary pressure curves. Additionally, a tensorial resistivity model is implemented for heterogeneous structures such as fiber bundles, aligning resistivity along principal axes determined from the Hessian and gradient of local porosity fields. Benchmark tests, including practical rock geometries, validate these enhancements, demonstrating improved transient interface dynamics, accurate capture of irreducible fluid components, and correct directional effects in under-resolved structures.

TL;DR: Semi-implicit VMS formulation for Navier-Stokes with exact adjoint, eliminating derivative terms and simplifying implementation while maintaining accuracy with 2-4x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and simpler VMS formulation that avoids complex derivative terms and case-by-case integrations by parts required in nonlinear residual-based VMS implementations, particularly for low-order FEM settings.

Method: Semi-implicit approach linearizes convection using extrapolated Oseen-type velocity, creating linear advection operator with exact adjoint. This enables systematic derivative-transfer mechanism within VMS closure, eliminating unresolved-scale derivative terms. Method works with three advection forms: convective-, skew-symmetric-, and divergence-form.

Result: Method reduces wall-clock time by 2-4x compared to fully implicit nonlinear formulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Temporal convergence verified. Convective and skew-symmetric forms remain robust across test cases, while divergence-form can become nonconvergent for purely Dirichlet boundaries.

Conclusion: The semi-implicit VMS formulation provides significant computational efficiency gains with simplified implementation, making it practical for low-order FEM settings while maintaining accuracy for turbulent flow simulations.

Abstract: A semi-implicit, residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation is developed for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The approach linearizes convection using an extrapolated (Oseen-type) convecting velocity, producing a linear advection operator at each time step. For this operator, the adjoint can be written exactly. Exploiting this exact adjoint yields a systematic derivative-transfer mechanism within the VMS closure. In particular, unresolved-scale contributions enter the weak form without spatial derivatives of the modeled fine-scale velocity. The resulting terms also avoid derivatives of coarse-scale residuals and stabilization parameters. This eliminates the boundary-condition-sensitive, case-by-case integrations by parts that often accompany nonlinear residual-based VMS implementations, and it simplifies implementation in low-order FEM settings.
  The formulation is presented for a generalized linear convection operator encompassing three common advection forms (convective-, skew-symmetric- and divergence-form). Their numerical behavior is compared, along with the corresponding fully implicit nonlinear VMS counterparts. Because the method is linear by construction, each time step requires only one linear solve. Across the benchmark suite, this reduces wall-clock time by $2$--$4\times$ relative to fully implicit nonlinear formulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Temporal convergence is verified, and validation is performed on standard problems including the lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at chord Reynolds number $6\times 10^{6}$. Overall, the convective and the skew-symmetric forms remain robust across the test cases, whereas the divergence-form can become nonconvergent for problems with purely Dirichlet boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with steep gradients, intricate boundary conditions, and physical constraints in fluid dynamics, leading to convergence failures and numerical instabilities.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks into PINN architecture to capture spatial correlations in steady-state velocity fields of 2D charged fluids under external electric fields.

Conclusion: The LSTM-PINN hybrid approach offers improved computational efficiency and reliability for modeling electrohydrodynamic flows, with applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have demonstrated considerable success in solving complex fluid dynamics problems. However, their performance often deteriorates in regimes characterized by steep gradients, intricate boundary conditions, and stringent physical constraints, leading to convergence failures and numerical instabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks into the PINN architecture, enhancing its ability to capture spatial correlations in the steady-state velocity field of a two-dimensional charged fluid under an external electric field. Our results demonstrate that the LSTM-enhanced PINN model significantly outperforms conventional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based PINNs in terms of convergence rate, numerical stability, and predictive accuracy. This innovative approach offers improved computational efficiency and reliability for modeling electrohydrodynamic flows, providing new insights and strategies for applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics.

*Alain Schumacher,Takuji Nishimura,Makoto Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: MT19937 Mersenne Twister fails a natural run-length distribution test, showing anomalous frequency of run-length 623 that's 40x expected, with p-value near 0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify previously unknown statistical defects in the widely-used MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, which has been considered robust except for known issues with linear complexity and artificially designed birthday-spacing tests.

Method: Developed a natural test based on distribution of run-lengths in output 32-bit integers, mathematically analyzed the observed phenomena, and derived theorems explaining the failures.

Result: MT19937 fails the run-length test with number of observations for run-length 623 being approximately 40 times larger than expected, resulting in p-value almost 0. Mathematical analysis explains these failures.

Conclusion: While the defect requires astronomical efforts to find and is not considered serious for most applications, the phenomena should be reported to the pseudorandom number generation community for awareness and further study.

Abstract: The Mersenne Twister MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, introduced by the last two authors in 1998, is still widely used. It passes all existing statistical tests, except for the linear complexity test, which measures the ratio of the even-odd of the number of 1's among specific bits (and hence should not be important for most applications). Harase reported that MT19937 is rejected by some birthday-spacing tests, which are rather artificially designed. In this paper, we report that MT19937 fails in a natural test based on the distribution of run-lengths on which we found an identical value in the output 32-bit integers. The number of observations of the run-length 623 is some 40 times larger than the expectation (and than the numbers of the observations of 622 and 624, etc.), which implies that the corresponding p-value is almost 0.
  We mathematically analyze the phenomena, and obtain a theorem which explains these failures. It seems not to be a serious defect of MT19937, because finding the defect requires astronomical efforts. Still, the phenomena should be reported to the academic society relating to pseudorandom number generation.

### [40] [A Velocity Coupled Radial Acceleration Ansatz for Disk-Galaxy Rotation Curves: Fits to SPARC, Bayesian Inference, and Parameter Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21376)
*Nalin Dhiman*

Main category: astro-ph.GA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phenomenological velocity-coupled acceleration (VCA) model as an alternative to standard dark matter halo parameterizations for fitting galaxy rotation curves, showing it performs comparably to NFW and Burkert halos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotation curves of disk galaxies provide crucial empirical data about the relationship between baryonic matter and dynamics. Standard dark matter halo models (like NFW and Burkert) are commonly used, but the authors want to explore a minimal, explicitly phenomenological alternative that directly relates acceleration to velocity.

Method: The authors introduce a velocity-coupled acceleration (VCA) model where additional inward radial acceleration is proportional to local tangential speed: a_vca(r) = γ(r)v(r), with a saturating coupling γ(r) = v_inf/(r + r_0). Combined with circular-motion condition, this yields a quadratic equation for v(r) with closed-form solution. They fit this model to 171 rotation curves from SPARC sample using published baryonic decompositions, comparing to NFW and Burkert halos using identical optimization pipeline and error model.

Result: With a systematic error floor of 5 km/s, the VCA model is typically competitive with NFW halos and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than Burkert halos in information-criterion comparisons. MCMC inference shows strong degeneracy between v_inf and r_0 parameters, with only 47/171 galaxies yielding well-identified posteriors. Radial holdout cross-validation shows predictive RMSE comparable to NFW and Burkert models.

Conclusion: The phenomenological VCA model provides a viable alternative to standard halo parameterizations for fitting galaxy rotation curves, performing competitively with established models while offering a different physical interpretation of the relationship between acceleration and velocity in galaxies.

Abstract: Observed rotation curves of disk galaxies remain a sharp empirical probe of the relationship between baryons and dynamics. We study a minimal, explicitly \emph{phenomenological} alternative to standard halo parameterizations: an additional inward \emph{radial} acceleration proportional to the local \emph{tangential} speed, $a_{\vca}(r)=γ(r)\,v(r)$, with a saturating coupling $γ(r)=\vinf/(r+\rzero)$. Combining this ansatz with the circular-motion condition yields a quadratic equation for $v(r)$ with a closed-form physical branch.We fit this ``velocity-coupled acceleration'' (\vca) model to $N_\mathrm{gal}=171$ rotation curves from the SPARC sample using the published baryonic decompositions (gas, disk, bulge), and we compare to two commonly used two-parameter halo models (NFW and Burkert) using an identical optimization pipeline and error model.For a fiducial systematic error floor $σ_0=5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the \vca model is typically competitive with an NFW halo and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than a Burkert halo in information-criterion comparisons.We further perform MCMC inference for \vca parameters, quantify posterior predictive coverage, and show that parameter posteriors exhibit a strong $\vinf$--$\rzero$ degeneracy for many galaxies; only $47/171$ galaxies yield well-identified posteriors under simple width-based criteria. We also perform a simple radial holdout cross-validation (outer 30\% of radii) and find predictive RMSE comparable to NFW and Burkert under this protocol.Finally..

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear transformations are computationally expensive on electronic platforms, and while optical computing promises high speed and energy efficiency, there's a need for compact solutions that efficiently use chip space and exploit multiple degrees of freedom of light.

Method: Developed a programmable photonic integrated circuit architecture using embedded optical feedback loops that combines resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers, operating on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom.

Result: Experimental demonstration of fabricated samples compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms operating at single- and dual-frequency modes, showing in situ training capabilities and validating parallel-computing capabilities with reduced optical port requirements and minimized power losses.

Conclusion: Feedback-loop photonic integrated circuits offer scalable, compact, and energy-efficient solutions for linear optical computing by leveraging resonances for massive parallel computing in the frequency domain.

Abstract: Linear transformations are cornerstone operations utilized in modern computing, but are computationally expensive on current electronic platforms. Optical computing has been positioned as a new computing solution, promising high speed and energy efficiency by exploiting the available degrees of freedom of light. Although solutions exist in the optical domain, there is a continuous search for compact solutions that properly utilize the limited chip space and exploit various degrees of freedom of light. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing.

*John M. Mango,Ronald Katende*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper presents a simple projection method to enforce exact conservation laws in learned linear dynamical models by minimally perturbing the learned operator while satisfying the constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When learning linear dynamical models from data, the learned operator may violate known conservation laws or invariants that should be preserved. There's a need to correct such models to respect physical constraints while minimally altering the learned dynamics.

Method: Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and constraint matrix $C$ encoding invariants, the method computes the closest matrix $A^\star$ to $\widehat{A}$ in Frobenius norm that satisfies $C^\top A = 0$. This is achieved via orthogonal projection: $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. For single invariants, this reduces to a rank-one update.

Result: The correction is uniquely defined, low rank, and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. The projection enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, as verified numerically on a Markov-type example.

Conclusion: The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model, ensuring physical constraints are satisfied with minimal modification to the learned dynamics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.

We introduce and describe isoequilibrium deformations of arbitrary collections of $d$ real disjoint closed intervals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the critical temperature and phase transition behavior of continuous spin 2D square-lattice Ising model, which extends beyond the traditional discrete spin (±1) model to continuous spins in the interval [-1,+1].

Method: Monte-Carlo simulation of continuous spin Ising model on 2D square lattice with periodic boundary conditions, using spins s ∈ [-1,+1]. Applied finite size scaling analysis to extract critical exponents.

Result: Found critical temperature Tc ≈ 0.925 with clear second-order phase transition. Critical exponents for susceptibility, specific heat, and magnetization match standard 2D Ising universality class values.

Conclusion: The continuous spin 2D Ising model exhibits the same universality class as the standard discrete spin model, despite the continuous nature of spins, confirming robustness of critical behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the critical temperature $T_c$ of continuous spin $2d$ square-lattice Ising model using Monte-Carlo simulation. We have considered spins $s$ in a bounded interval, where $s \in [-1,+1]$ in square-lattice configuration with periodic boundary condition. We have observed that the critical temperature $T_c$ is approximately $0.925$, showing a clear second order phase transition. Considering finite size scaling, we have also obtained the critical exponents associated with susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization and we find that these values are in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained for the standard $2d$ Ising universality class.

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: Massive particle in 1D with spin-half wave function evolves via free Dirac equation from Gaussian initial state. At large times, wave function becomes locally plane wave with fixed asymptotic momentum/energy. Sign of asymptotic energy depends on initial position, with negative energy particles having velocity opposite to momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-term behavior of massive particles described by Dirac equation, specifically how initial conditions determine asymptotic momentum/energy states and the relationship between velocity and momentum for negative energy solutions.

Method: Analyze trajectories using free Dirac equation with Gaussian wave packet initial conditions. Apply stationary phase approximation method with rigorous error bounds to prove asymptotic behavior.

Result: At large times, wave function becomes locally plane wave with fixed asymptotic momentum k and energy ±E. Sign of asymptotic energy determined by initial position. Negative energy particles have asymptotic velocity opposite to their momentum direction.

Conclusion: The Dirac equation leads to predictable asymptotic states where initial position determines whether particles evolve to positive or negative energy plane waves, with negative energy states exhibiting counter-intuitive velocity-momentum relationship.

Abstract: We analyze the trajectories of a massive particle in one space dimension whose motion is guided by a spin-half wave function that evolves according to the free Dirac equation, with its initial wave function being a Gaussian wave packet with a nonzero expected value of momentum $k$ and the positive expected value of energy $E = \sqrt{m^2+k^2}$. We prove that at large times, the wave function becomes {\em locally} a plane wave, which corresponds to trajectories with fixed values for asymptotic momentum $k$ and asymptotic energy $E$ or $-E$. The sign of the asymptotic energy is determined by the initial position of the particle. Particles with negative energy will have an asymptotic velocity that is in the opposite direction of their momentum.
  The proof uses the stationary phase approximation method, for which we establish a rigorous error bound.

Result: The enhanced model reproduces expected two-stage refilling behavior, H+ dominance, early-time O+ contributions, and H+-He+ coupling through ambipolar electric field. Sensitivity experiments show distinct ion species roles, and comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 confirm model robustness.

Conclusion: Incorporating realistic electron temperature variations strengthens physical understanding of complex multi-ion transport during plasmasphere recovery, providing a more complete framework for future 3D extensions and interpretation of storm recovery processes.

Abstract: A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.

Motivation: Ling's gradient-comparison method provides an explicit lower bound for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue λ, but loses quantitative information through a Jensen-Hölder averaging step that replaces a nonconstant comparison function by its mean.

Method: The authors isolate the problematic averaging step in Ling's argument and refine it using the uniform strong convexity of x→x^{-1/2} on (0,1]. This refinement introduces a variance term that retains part of the discarded oscillation information.

Result: The method yields an explicit closed-form in-diameter bound that is strictly stronger than Ling's estimate for every K>0.

Conclusion: By refining the averaging technique in Ling's gradient-comparison method, the authors obtain improved lower bounds for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue on manifolds with curvature and boundary conditions.

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary and $n\geq 2$. Assume that ${\mathrm{Ric}(M)\ge (n-1)K}$ for some ${K>0}$ and that $\partial M$ has nonnegative mean curvature with respect to the outward unit normal. Denote by $λ$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Ling's gradient-comparison method (Ling, 2006) provides an explicit lower bound for $λ$ in terms of $K$ and the in-diameter $\tilde d$ (twice the maximal distance from a point of $M$ to $\partial M$). We isolate the only step in Ling's argument that loses quantitative information: a Jensen-Hölder averaging that replaces a nonconstant one-dimensional comparison function by its mean. Using the uniform strong convexity of $x\to x^{-1/2}$ on $(0,1]$, we refine this averaging by a variance term and thereby retain part of the discarded oscillation. This yields an explicit closed-form in-diameter bound that is strictly stronger than Ling's estimate for every $K>0$.
