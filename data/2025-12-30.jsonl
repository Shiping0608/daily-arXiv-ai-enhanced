The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology, and its solution grows more challenging as the network size increases. We present an algorithm that utilizes a given partition of a network into tractable sizes to compute a global solution for the full nonlinear system through local solution of smaller subsystems induced by the partitions. When the partitions are induced by interconnects or transfer points corresponding to networks owned by different operators, the method ensures data is shared solely at the interconnects, leaving network operators free to solve the network flow system corresponding to their own domain in any manner of their choosing. The proposed method is shown to be connected to the Schur complement and the method's viability demonstrated on some challenging test cases."}

The method applies to participating media ranging from transparent to absorbing, emitting, and scattering, with boundaries ranging from absorbing to reflecting. Given a first-interaction exchange factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$, the transformation produces an absorption matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and a multiple reflection-scattering matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ through a Neumann series that analytically traces all reflection-scattering paths to steady state. The paper establishes rigorous conditions under which the method guarantees convergence, non-negative radiation, and exact energy conservation to machine precision. A comparison with Noble's matrix formulation of Hottel's zonal method reveals a previously unidentified discrepancy in that classical approach; the proposed transformation eliminates this discrepancy. The method is validated against the diffusion approximation in the high-extinction limit and against results of Crosbie and Schrenker for pure and partial scattering cases. The method is applicable to medium-scale general reflecting-scattering problems and scales to large problems when negligible reflection-scattering and high extinction ensure matrix sparsity."}

In this study, we introduce a data-efficient, multi-input, multi-target learning approach that integrates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)-guided experimentation with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) to jointly predict multiple mechanical and manufacturing properties of CFRC-AMs based on different manufacturing parameters. We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p <= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics."}

LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization."}

This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena."}

Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries."}

Interestingly, we explain the crucial role of gap's accuracy when treating seeds with CAP, especially to improve interaction between seeds and plasma and therefore ensure an efficient treatment. CAP significantly improved the germination rates of seeds of dormant and non-dormant sunflower genotypes under water stress, demonstrating its efficiency in alleviating seed dormancy and in improving germination under suboptimal conditions. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments demonstrated that plasma treatment also stimulated seedling development under water stress conditions. These findings highlight the potential of CAP treatment as an effective approach to promote the whole process of emergence of crop species."}

This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes.

The efficiency and selectivity were evaluated through germination ability, time to 10% germination (T10), mean germination time and greenhouse emergence. Five days after imbibition, germination was only 18% for the untreated seeds but 60% for the plasma-treated seeds. Germination also began 24 hours earlier and mean germination time was reduced across most populations. However, there was a limited effect on seedling emergence, which remained around 55% for both untreated and treated samples.

This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change."}

Extending the framework of [7,8] from rectangular to triangular meshes, we introduce three procedures for constructing high-degree Frenet-IFE spaces: an initial construction based on monomial bases, a generalized construction using orthogonal polynomials, and reconstruction methods aimed at improving the conditioning of the associated mass matrix. The optimal approximation capability of the proposed IFE spaces is demonstrated through numerical examples. We further incorporate these spaces into interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic interface problems and observe optimal convergence rates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms."}

The confinement of cold energetic electrons produced near the hollow cathode plays a crucial role in guiding the plasma along the device axis. Experimental diagnostics reveal a high concentration of energetic electrons in the peripheral region near the source, which progressively converge toward the axis at a downstream location approximately 3.0 meters from the cathode. The length of the plasma column exhibits an inverse relationship with the electron-neutral collision frequency, indicating the significance of collisional damping in the propagation of energetic electrons. These observations are further supported by fluid simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, which qualitatively reproduce the experimental trends. The results are consistent with a theoretical model previously proposed by the authors, reinforcing the understanding of energetic electron behaviour in magnetically guided plasma columns."}

In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.\n  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.\n  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario.

Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations."}

For the two-dimensional initial-boundary value problem, we establish the existence of global finite energy solutions and global weak solutions, using a suitable approximation scheme combined with compactness methods. Next, by carefully analyzing three decoupled subsystems and employing a bootstrap argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution for sufficiently regular initial data, as well as the propagation of regularity for global weak solutions. In particular, we show that the density of the chemical substance stays bounded for all time if its initial datum is bounded.

A Front-Tracking Method (FTM) is extended to handle a general 3D unstructured Eulerian grid and strong wall effects. The challenges include the accuracy and robustness of the solver when the drop spreads on the retina under the effect of a magnetic field, which necessitates the design of a multi-region Eulerian grid and defining a threshold distance between the front and wall, along with the choice of an effective front smoothing and volume correction FTM sub-algorithms near the walls.

To accelerate the calculation, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method (Mortier et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) and a corresponding fluid estimation technique (Mortier et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys., 2022) have recently been proposed. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of KDMC combined with the associated fluid estimation. The analysis consists of proving theoretical upper bounds for both KDMC and the fluid estimation, and numerical verifications of these bounds. In addition, we compare the analyzed algorithm with a purely fluid-based method using the fully kinetic MC method as a reference. The algorithm consistently achieves lower error than the fluid-based method, and even one order of magnitude lower in a fusion-relevant test case. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits a significant speedup compared to the reference kinetic MC method. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of KDMC with the associated fluid estimation in nuclear fusion applications."}

Physical and numerical arguments are combined to derive power-law scalings at very high Reynolds numbers. A theoretical convergence analysis for both Jacobi and multigrid solvers defines a two-dimensional phase space divided into two regions depending on whether the number of solver iterations tends to decrease or increase with the Reynolds number. Numerical results indicate that, for Navier-Stokes turbulence, the complexity decreases with increasing Reynolds number, whereas for the one-dimensional Burgers equation it follows the opposite trend. The proposed theoretical framework thus provides a unified perspective on how solver convergence scales with the Reynolds number and offers valuable guidance for the development of next-generation preconditioning and multigrid strategies for extreme-scale simulations."}

Consequently, dynamically simplified formulations are needed for coarse-grained simulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) are widely used both in academia and industry. These models require a subgrid characteristic length, typically linked to the local grid size. While this length scale corresponds to the mesh step for isotropic grids, its definition for unstructured or anisotropic Cartesian meshes, such as the pancake-like meshes commonly used to capture near-wall turbulence or shear layers, remains an open question. Despite its significant influence on LES model performance, no consensus has been reached on its proper formulation. In this work, we introduce a novel subgrid characteristic length. This length scale is derived from the analysis of the entanglement between the numerical discretization and the filtering in LES. Its mathematical properties and simplicity make it a robust choice for reducing the impact of mesh anisotropies on simulation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed subgrid length is demonstrated through simulations of decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent channel flow using different codes."}

Additionally, the curvature of the free surface and submerged bodies is incorporated through curvilinear elements obtained via transfinite linear blending, which conserves the high-order convergent properties of the overall scheme.

However, this imposes very small time-steps because the eigenvalues of the (linearized) dynamical system, re-scaled by the time-step, must lie inside the stability region. In practice, fast and accurate estimations of the spectral radii of both the discrete convective and diffusive terms are therefore needed. This is virtually always done using the so-called CFL condition. On the other hand, the large heterogeneity and complexity of modern supercomputing systems are nowadays hindering the efficient cross-platform portability of CFD codes. In this regard, our leitmotiv reads: relying on a minimal set of (algebraic) kernels is crucial for code portability and maintenance! In this context, this work focuses on the computation of eigenbounds for the above-mentioned convective and diffusive matrices which are needed to determine the time-step à la CFL. To do so, a new inexpensive method, that does not require to re-construct these time-dependent matrices, is proposed and tested. It just relies on a sparse-matrix vector product where only vectors change on time. Hence, both implementation in existing codes and cross-platform portability are straightforward. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated for different test cases on both structured Cartesian and unstructured meshes. Finally, the method is combined with a self-adaptive temporal scheme, leading to significantly larger time-steps compared with other more conventional CFL-based approaches."}

We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch.

In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$α$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles."}

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change."}

Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations."}

We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\\ell\\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-δ})$, $k=O(r^{-2-δ})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong."}

This coupled evolution equation is stated here in terms of the elastic deformation gradient and models transport and nonlinear relaxation effects. In the existing literature, numerical schemes for such models often suffer from accuracy limitations and convergence problems, usually due to the lack of rigorous existence results or inherent limitations of the discretization. Therefore, our main goal is to prove the (subsequence) convergence of the proposed numerical method to a large-data global weak solution in two dimensions, without relying on cut-offs or additional regularization. This also provides an alternative proof of the recent existence result by Bulíček et al.~(Nonlinearity, 2022).
