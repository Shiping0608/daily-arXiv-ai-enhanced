Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs.

The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.\n  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario.

The software implements a hybrid computational strategy that couples Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization with a symplectic St\u00f8rmer-Verlet temporal integrator, ensuring both exponential spatial convergence for smooth solutions and long-term preservation of Hamiltonian structure. To optimize performance, the solver incorporates adaptive timestepping based on Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria and utilizes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for parallelized force computation. The library's capabilities are validated across four canonical physical regimes: dispersive linear wave propagation, static topological kink preservation in phi-fourth theory, integrable breather dynamics in the sine-Gordon model, and non-integrable kink-antikink collisions. Beyond standard numerical validation, this work establishes a multi-faceted analysis framework employing information-theoretic entropy metrics (Shannon, R\u00e9nyi, and Tsallis), kernel density estimation, and phase space reconstruction to quantify the distinct phenomenological signatures of these regimes.

We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\\ell\\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-\u03b4})$, $k=O(r^{-2-\u03b4})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen.
