Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions."}

We present transformer-based, autoregressive surrogates for efficient prediction of 2D, time-dependent plasma edge state fields. Trained on SOLPS-ITER spatiotemporal data, the surrogates forecast electron temperature, electron density, and radiated power over extended horizons. We evaluate model variants trained with increasing autoregressive horizons (1-100 steps) on short- and long-horizon prediction tasks. Longer-horizon training systematically improves rollout stability and mitigates error accumulation, enabling stable predictions over hundreds to thousands of steps and reproducing key dynamical features such as the motion of high-radiation regions. Measured end-to-end wall-clock times show the surrogate is orders of magnitude faster than SOLPS-ITER, enabling rapid parameter exploration. Prediction accuracy degrades when the surrogate enters physical regimes not represented in the training dataset, motivating future work on data enrichment and physics-informed constraints. Overall, this approach provides a fast, accurate surrogate for computationally intensive plasma edge simulations, supporting rapid scenario exploration, control-oriented studies, and progress toward real-time applications in fusion devices."}

Rather than replacing the theory with a black-box surrogate, we embed compact neural networks within the Helmholtz free-energy functional, learning local and nonlocal corrections that preserve thermodynamic consistency while capturing missing correlations. Applied to Lennard-Jones fluids, the resulting augmented excess free-energy functional quantitatively reproduces equilibrium density profiles, coexistence curves, and surface tensions across a broad temperature range, and accurately predicts contact angles and droplet shapes far beyond the training regime. This approach combines the interpretability of statistical mechanics with the adaptability of modern machine learning, establishing a general route to learned thermodynamic functionals that bridge molecular simulations and continuum-scale models."}

Both schemes are equipped with a well-balancing (WB) property, which allows to preserve the equilibrium of a priori known stationary solutions exactly at the discrete level. We validate our numerical approaches by successfully reproducing standard vacuum test cases, such as the robust stability, the linearized wave, and the gauge wave tests, as well as achieving long-term stable evolutions of stationary black holes, including Kerr black holes with extreme spin. Concerning the coupling with matter, modeled by the relativistic Euler equations, we perform a classical test of spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, as well as an evolution of a perturbed non-rotating neutron star, demonstrating the capability of our schemes to operate also on the full Einstein-Euler system.

Due to their thermodynamic compatibility the class of SHTC systems satisfies an additional conservation law for the total energy and many PDE in this class of equations also satisfy stationary differential constraints (involutions). First, we propose a simple semi-discrete cell-centered HTC finite volume scheme that employs collocated grids and that is compatible with the total energy conservation law, but which does not satisfy the involutions. Second, we develop a fully discrete semi-implicit finite volume scheme that conserves total energy and which can be proven to satisfy also the involution constraints exactly at the discrete level. This method is a vertex-based staggered semi-implicit scheme that preserves the basic vector calculus identities $\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\times A = 0$ and $\\nabla \\times \\nabla φ= 0$ for any vector and scalar field, respectively, exactly at the discrete level and which is also exactly totally energy conservative. The main key ingredient of the proposed implicit scheme is the fact that it uses a discrete version of the symmetric-hyperbolic Godunov-form of the governing PDE system. This leads naturally to sequences of symmetric and positive definite linear algebraic systems to be solved inside an iterative fixed-point method used in each time step. We apply our new schemes to three different SHTC systems. In particular, we consider the equations of nonlinear acoustics, the nonlinear Maxwell equations in the absence of charges and a nonlinear version of the Maxwell-GLM system. We also show some numerical results to provide evidence of the stated properties of the proposed schemes."}

We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores.

Here, we introduce a general method for computing the shape of an ideal-MHD equilibrium that can be used in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric configurations. This framework uses a Fourier mode analysis to define the shaping modes (e.g. elongation, triangularity, squareness, etc.) of cross-sections that can be non-planar. Relative to an axisymmetric equilibrium, the additional degree of freedom in a non-axisymmetric equilibrium manifests as a rotation of each shaping mode about the magnetic axis. Using this method, a shaping analysis is performed on non-axisymmetric configurations with precise quasi-symmetry and select cases from the QUASR database spanning a range of quasi-symmetry quality. Empirically, we find that quasi-symmetry results from a spatial resonance between shape complexity and shape rotation about the magnetic axis. The quantitative features of this resonance correlate closely with a configuration's rotational transform and number of field periods. Based on these observations, it is conjectured that this shaping paradigm can facilitate systematic investigations into the relationship between general flux-surface geometries and other figures of merit."}

A charged body moving through a dusty plasma medium can generate diverse nonlinear waves, such as precursors and pinned solitons.

We have examined the role of the driver in shaping and evolving these wave excitations. In particular we studied the effect of primarily three source parameters, namely, amplitude, width, and flow speed, on the evolution of nonlinear structures. The driver generates a perturbation in the stable system configuration, which couples with medium characteristics and eventually evolves into propagating excitations. Our finding shows that the excitation of nonlinear structure by a moving body in a plasma medium is not just dictated by the mach number but also the features of the source such as amplitude and width. As a novel finding apart from pinned and precursor solitons, we observe another nonlinear structure that lags behind the source term, maintaining its shape and speed as it propagates. These features are the first ever theoretical depiction of such lagging structures."}

Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data.

The results demonstrate that in the full power scenario, the avalanche multiplication factor is sufficiently high ($G_\\text{av} \\approx 1.3 \\cdot 10^5$) to convert a mere 5.5 A seed current into macroscopic RE beams of $\\approx 0.7$ MA when large amounts of impurities are present. For even higher RE seeds, the RE current can peak at $ \\approx 3.2$ MA, constituting up to $\\approx$ 80% of the total plasma current during the CQ. These findings suggest that, unlike the Day-0 phase, the disruption mitigation strategy for the full power scenario involves a careful balance between thermal load mitigation and RE avoidance, necessitating a well-chosen quantity of injected impurities. This work provides the baseline needed for future estimations of RE loads on the plasma-facing components of DTT, which will be essential for designing and positioning mitigation components like sacrificial limiters."}

Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems."}

Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers."}

When the system is $C^k$, we can only ensure the existence of a $C^k$ solution, but the integral manifolds must be $C^{k+1}$. In addition, we see a counterexample in which the system is $C^1$, but there is no $C^2$ solution.

Moreover, an expected convergence rate for the source error is derived in a weaker topology. We also extend the analysis to the fully discrete case with finite element discretization, showing that the overall error depends only on the noise level, regularization parameter, time step size, and spatial mesh size.

Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes.

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models."}

Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, where partial slip effects are significant. Under suitable smallness assumptions on the boundary flux and on the normal component of the prescribed surface velocity, we establish the existence of weak steady solutions to the coupled fluid-structure system. A key analytical ingredient is the derivation of a Korn-type inequality adapted to exterior domains with rigid-body motion and Navier-slip interfaces, which yields uniform control of both the fluid velocity and the translational and rotational velocities of the body. Beyond existence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a prescribed slip velocity on the body surface induces nontrivial translational or rotational motion of the rigid body. This is achieved through the introduction of a finite-dimensional thrust space, defined via auxiliary exterior Stokes problems with Navier boundary conditions, which captures the effective contribution of boundary-driven flows to the rigid-body motion.

Over the years a multitude of methods -- for discretizing the operator and for the resultant discrete system -- have been developed and analyzed in the field of numerical analysis. High-accuracy and provably convergent discretization approaches can be used to examine the interplay between the spectrum of an operator and the geometric properties of the spatial domain or manifold it is defined on.

In this work, we address the mixing property in the regime of large damping and establish that solutions are attracted toward the unique invariant probability measure at polynomial rates of arbitrary order. Our approach is based on a coupling strategy with pathwise Strichartz estimates."}

We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general."}

This extends the framework developed recently for conservative self-similar Markov processes on the upper half-space to a broader geometric setting. Examples of Markov processes that fall into our general framework include traces of isotropic $α$-stable processes in $C^{1,\\rm Dini}$ sets, processes in Lipschitz sets arising in connection with the nonlocal Neumann problem, and a large class of resurrected self-similar processes in the closed upper half-space.\n  We establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for these Markov processes. A fundamental difficulty in accomplishing this task is that, in contrast to the existing literature on heat kernels for jump processes, the tails of the associated jump measures in our setting are not uniformly bounded. Thus, standard techniques in the existing literature used to study heat kernels are not applicable. To overcome this obstacle, we employ recently developed weighted functional inequalities specifically designed for jump kernels blowing up at the boundary."}

We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $α> 2γ/(1+γ)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining Lê's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces."}

Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \\emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.\n  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality.\n  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained."}
