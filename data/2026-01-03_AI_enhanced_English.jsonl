We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part.

Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores.

This study presents a comprehensive $\u03bc$FE framework for large-scale biomechanical analysis of an intact New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit femur, integrating advanced segmentation, scalable finite element solvers, and experimental validation using predominantly open-source libraries. Bone geometries were segmented from $\u03bc$CT data using the MIA clustering algorithm and converted into voxel-based $\u03bc$FE meshes, which were solved using the open-source MFEM library with algorithms designed for large-scale linear elasticity systems.\n  The numerical solutions were verified by comparing with a commercial finite element solver, and by evaluating the performance of full assembly and element-by-element formulations within MFEM. Models containing over $8\\times10^{8}$ DOFs were solved using moderate HPC resources, demonstrating the feasibility of anatomically realistic $\u03bc$FE simulations at this scale. Resolution effects were investigated by comparing models with voxel sizes of 20, 40, and 80 $\u03bc$m, revealing that 40 $\u03bc$m preserves boundary displacement and principal strain distributions with minimal bias while significantly reducing computational cost. Sensitivity analyses further showed that segmentation parameters influence the global mechanical response.\n  Finally, $\u03bc$FE predictions were coupled with Digital Image Correlation measurements on an NZW rabbit femur under compression to calibrate effective bone material properties at the micron scale. The results demonstrate that large-scale, experimentally informed $\u03bc$FE modeling can be achieved using open-source tools, providing a robust foundation for preclinical assessment of bone mechanics and treatment-related risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Open-source \u03bcFE framework enables large-scale biomechanical analysis of intact rabbit femur using \u03bcCT data, validated with experiments, showing 40\u03bcm resolution balances accuracy and computational cost.", "motivation": "High-resolution voxel-based \u03bcFE models from \u03bcCT imaging provide detailed bone mechanics but are computationally challenging at anatomically relevant scales.

This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper.
