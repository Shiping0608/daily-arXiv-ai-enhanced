In this paper, we construct a large class of such methods by combining finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) for spatial semidiscretization with symplectic integrators for time discretization. The resulting methods satisfy a local multisymplectic conservation law in space and time, which generalizes the symplectic conservation law of Hamiltonian ODEs, and which carries finer information about Hamiltonian structure than other approaches based on global function spaces. We give particular attention to conforming FEEC methods and hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. The theory and methods are illustrated by application to the semilinear Hodge wave equation."}

Rare events are formulated as Bayesian inverse problems through a nonsmooth limit-state function whose zero level set characterises the event of interest. To overcome the nondifferentiability of this function, we propose a smooth approximation that preserves the failure set and yields a posterior distribution satisfying the small-noise limit. The resulting potential is sampled by ALDI, a (derivative-free) interacting particle system whose affine invariance allows it to adapt to the local anisotropy of the posterior.\n  We demonstrate the performance of the method across a hierarchy of benchmarks, namely two low-dimensional examples (an algebraic problem with convex geometry and a dynamical problem of saddle-type instability) and a point-vortex model for atmospheric blockings. In all cases, ALDI concentrates near the relevant near-critical sets and provides accurate proposal distributions for self-normalised importance sampling. The framework is computationally robust, potentially gradient-free, and well-suited for complex forward models with strong geometric anisotropy. These results highlight ALDI as a promising tool for rare-event estimation in unstable regimes of dynamical systems."}

This behavior indicates coherent collective emission in the generation process and provides a useful scaling law for THz output. Microbolometer-based beam profiling shows a relatively large THz beam divergence (~0.2 rad). Single-shot THz interferometry further shows that the emitted THz pulse is sub-picosecond in duration and broadband. Combining the beam-profile and interferometric measurements, the THz spectrum is expected to span approximately 1-20 THz.

A reduced Schur complement is identified that fully characterizes enrichment and well-posedness and provides a sharp spectral stability result. We show that this quantity coincides with the square root of the smallest eigenvalue of a low-dimensional symmetric positive definite operator. This matrix-based viewpoint yields simple spectral criteria for the invertibility of local moment systems and motivates spectrally preferable choices of face and interior bases with improved conditioning. Using the resulting degrees of freedom together with density and scaling parameters as design variables, we formulate a small eigenvalue optimization problem aimed at improving stability and reducing the condition number of the global reconstruction system. Three-dimensional experiments on uniform and quasi-uniform simplicial meshes illustrate the predicted stability, conditioning, and convergence behaviour of the enriched quadratic reconstruction."}

Analytical modelling and particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the maximum amplification in wakefield amplitude is obtained when spatial separation equals the plasma wavelength (λ_p). The spatial intervals between laser pulses critically influence the wakefield amplification.

The network is trained to map this coarse approximation to a high-fidelity source reconstruction, effectively suppressing truncation artifacts and recovering fine-scale geometric details. To enhance computational efficiency and robustness, we propose a high-to-low noise transfer learning strategy: a model pre-trained on high-noise regimes captures global topological features, offering a robust initialization for fine-tuning on lower-noise data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions with noise levels up to 100%, significantly outperforms traditional spectral methods under sparse measurement constraints, and generalizes well to unseen source geometries."}

We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $μ$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $μ$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation."}

Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive sampling strategy consistently yields more stable and accurate ROMs than random sampling does under the same computational budget."}

Firstly, based on the global-in-time well-posedness in $L^{2}(Ω, \\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)$, we define a \\emph{continuous} non-autonomous dynamical system (NDS) on the metric space $(\\mathcal{P}_{2}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2), d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)})$, where $d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)}$ is the dual-Lipschitz distance on $\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)$, the space of probability measures on $\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2$.

Moreover, when the deterministic external forcing terms are periodic in time, we demonstrate that the pullback measure attractors are also periodic. We also study the upper semicontinuity of pullback measure attractors as $(ε_1, ε_2, γ_1, γ_2) \\rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The main difficulty in proving the pullback asymptotic compactness of the NDS in $(\\mathcal{P}_{2}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2), d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)})$ is caused by the lack of compactness in infinite-dimensional lattice systems, which is overcome by using uniform tail-ends estimates.

By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena.

There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated to flare-type events from magnetars. We aim to provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, mass-loaded, magnetic explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We employ a semi-analytical approach for the solution of the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. We assume self-similarity in time and radius, axial symmetry, and separation of variables. There exists a dichotomy of solutions that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity.

We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow."}

Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation."}
