Data-driven ROMs are explainable, computationally efficient scientific machine learning models that aim to preserve the underlying physics of complex dynamical simulations. Since the quality of data-driven ROMs is sensitive to the quality of the limited training data, we seek to identify training parameters for which using the associated training data results in the best possible parametric ROM. Our approach uses the operator inference methodology, a regression-based strategy which can be tailored to particular parametric structure for a large class of problems. We establish a probabilistic version of parametric operator inference, casting the learning problem as a Bayesian linear regression. Prediction uncertainties stemming from the resulting probabilistic ROM solutions are used to design a sequential adaptive sampling scheme to select new training parameter vectors that promote ROM stability and accuracy globally in the parameter domain. We conduct numerical experiments for several nonlinear parametric systems of partial differential equations and compare the results to ROMs trained on random parameter samples.

The ratio of the poloidal to toroidal field and the inclusion of pressure and mass density affect the expansion velocity. The classes of these solutions can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts.

The fact that the model is posed on the real line makes the problem difficult from the point of view of learning techniques, since the setting required to model gKdV is structured on intricate oscillatory estimates dating from Kato, Bourgain and Kenig, Ponce and Vega, among others. Therefore, a first task is to adapt the setting of these techniques to the deep learning setting. We shall use a battery of Kenig-Ponce-Vega suitable norms and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to describe this approximative scheme, proving rigorous bounds on the approximation for each critical and subcritical gKdV model. We shall use this results to provide clear approximation results in the case of several gKdV nonlinear patterns such as solitons, multi-solitons, breathers, among other solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Deep neural network approximation of generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equations on unbounded real line using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with rigorous error bounds for subcritical and critical nonlinearities.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the challenge of numerically approximating gKdV models on the unbounded real line using deep learning techniques.

Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "A turbulent black-hole corona model using 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations shows self-regulated two-temperature plasma, nonthermal particle acceleration, and X-ray spectra matching observations with predicted MeV tails.", "motivation": "To understand particle energization and emission mechanisms in strongly turbulent black-hole coronae, and to explain observed X-ray spectra from sources like NGC 4151.", "method": "2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with electron-ion plasma composition, including injection/diffusive escape of photons/particles and self-consistent Compton scattering.", "result": "The model produces extended nonthermal ion distributions, X-ray spectra consistent with observations (excellent match to NGC 4151), MeV tails from electron acceleration at current sheets, and self-regulated two-temperature corona with ions carrying 60-70% of dissipated power.", "conclusion": "Turbulent black-hole coronae naturally develop two-temperature states with nonthermal particle acceleration, explaining observed X-ray spectra and predicting MeV emission detectable by future instruments."}}
