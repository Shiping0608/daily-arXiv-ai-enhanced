However, this method requires solving nonlinear simultaneous equations in $nN$ variables when the problem dimension is $n$. Recently, Ogata pointed out that Gauss-Seidel type fixed-point iteration works surprisingly well for solving these equations, typically reducing the error by one or two orders of magnitude at each iteration. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iteration and give a sufficient condition for its global convergence. We also provide an upper bound on its convergence factor, which explains the efficiency of this iteration. Some numerical examples that illustrate the validity of our analysis are also provided."}

While Flow Matching (FM) offers a powerful paradigm for constructing continuous-time transport maps, its deployment in high-precision integration is severely limited by the discretization bias inherent to numerical ODE solvers and the lack of rigorous convergence guarantees when coupled with Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. This paper addresses these critical gaps by proposing Flow Matching Importance Sampling Quasi-Monte Carlo (FM-ISQMC), a framework designed to transform biased generative flows into unbiased, high-order integration schemes. Methodologically, we construct a transport map by composing a logistic base transformation with an Euler-discretized neural ODE field and employ importance sampling to correct for residual transport errors. Our central contribution is twofold. First, we establish a general convergence analysis for QMC importance sampling with arbitrary transport maps, identifying sufficient growth conditions for the $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error rate. Second, we rigorously prove that the specific transport architecture of Flow Matching satisfies these conditions. Consequently, we establish a $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error for the unbiased FM-ISQMC estimator, extending classical QMC theory to the realm of generative models. Numerical experiments validate that FM-ISQMC consistently breaks through the error floor observed in direct transport methods, delivering superior precision. This work thus bridges the divide between deep generative modeling and numerical integration."}

The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators.

The first approach is based on a weighted arc-length equidistribution strategy driven by a monitor function to adaptively redistribute grid points. An adaptive monitor selection mechanism, constructed from the curvature and its variation, enhances spatial resolution in regions of strong geometric complexity while preserving mesh regularity. The second approach eliminates explicit reparameterization by incorporating a tangential velocity into the Willmore flow, with mesh redistribution inherently embedded in the geometric evolution. We further develop an energy-stable correction algorithm for the second method to guarantee discrete energy stability at the theoretical level. In both approaches, the monitor function serves as the core component of the adaptive framework, encoding essential geometric information -- such as curvature and curvature variation -- to guide mesh refinement and redistribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDFk-based adaptive schemes accurately capture the geometric evolution of the Willmore flow and exhibit excellent robustness and computational efficiency for problems involving complex interface geometries."}

To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.\n  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols."}

After non-dimensionalizing and rescaling, the problem is reformulated on a unit cylinder, and the behaviour of the energy functional is analyzed as $δ$ approaches zero. Using $Γ$-convergence, we show that the sequence of 3D energy functionals converges to a 1D functional, defined over displacement and damage fields that are independent of transverse coordinates. Compactness results guarantee the weak convergence of strains and damage gradients, while lower and upper bound inequalities confirm the energy limit. Minimizers of the 3D energy are proven to converge to the minimizers of the 1D energy, with strains approaching a diagonal form indicative of uniaxial deformation."}

This limitation is particularly critical for high-mass ions, where the generalized perveance increases rapidly because of their low velocity. Here, we demonstrate that this apparent space-charge limit can be overcome by shaping the electrostatic potential configuration of an existing multistage accelerator, thereby transforming the acceleration column itself into a combined acceleration-focusing column. By optimizing the interstage voltage configuration, a strong electrostatic lens effect is superimposed on the accelerating field to counteract space-charge-driven expansion. We formulate a generalized design framework that quantitatively maps the transport 'design window' in terms of beam current, ion mass, and acceleration voltage. For gold ions at 64 keV, this approach enables stable transport of beam currents exceeding 100 microA, more than an order of magnitude higher than the conventional limit. Numerical phase-space analysis shows that this improvement is achieved by prioritizing envelope control over emittance preservation, a trade-off intrinsic to space-charge-dominated regimes. Our results establish a universal and practical guideline for high-current heavy-ion beam transport, relevant to fusion plasma diagnostics, ion implantation, and massive molecular ion applications."}

This enables the derivation of rigorous energy estimates in Sobolev spaces. Our results rely on analytical tools from PDE theory, highlighting the compatibility of PINN approximations with classical energy estimates for nonlocal equations. We prove convergence of the PINN approximation in any space-time Sobolev norm $H^k$ (with $k \\in \\N)$.

This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize."}

In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves."}

For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\\mathcal{B}$, $g : \\bar P \\to C^0(\\bar P)$, $\\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions.

A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation.

Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \\geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\\text{edge}} \\approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\\text{edge}} \\geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement. Instead, non-benign cases are characterized by their lower MHD perturbation amplitudes $δB$. These observations suggest that the interplay between ideal and resistive dynamics governs the termination process."}

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K.

System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation. Our results indicate that quantum nanophotonics provides a route toward sustainable AI inference."}

This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \\approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit."}

The method employs an unstructured triangular mesh with support for triangulation of elements to form finer subgrids locally. The bathymetry is represented on the fine mesh, allowing the incorporation of small-scale features, while velocities are defined on the coarse mesh. The governing equations are solved numerically on the coarse mesh, making the method computationally cheaper compared to a traditional fine mesh computation. To accurately represent the velocities, we employ a second-order accurate WENO method and for temporal integration an explicit second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, we present a novel subgrid face value reconstruction that accounts for partially wet cells, where only some of the subgrid cells are wet. Together with a newly developed gravity source term discretization, we demonstrate that the scheme is well-balanced on the subgrid level. Finally, the subgrid method is validated on several test cases to show: i) that the scheme is well-balanced, ii) confirm the order of the accuracy of the scheme, and iii) demonstrate the capability of handling moving flood and dry boundaries. We also highlight when it is beneficial to increase the number of subgrid cells to improve the results of the finite volume method."}

We examine spatiotemporal film-thickness profiles resolved at the nanometer scale via phase-shifting imaging ellipsometry. For a pure solvent, the present governing equation recovers the classical lubrication physics driven by disjoining pressure and evaporation. In contrast, the nanofluid dynamics necessitates a unique transport term scaling with the gradient of the inverse film thickness.

Given high-fidelity training data generated by a spectral discretization, we learn a linear convolution stencil that approximates the spatial derivative operator appearing in Maxwell's equations.

These constraints guarantee a semi-discrete energy identity for the resulting Maxwell system. We prove that our constraints characterize the class of skew-symmetric convolution operators and express the associated numerical wave speed and CFL restriction for the classical leapfrog scheme in terms of the learned stencil's Fourier symbol. We then compare several convex solvers for the resulting quadratic program -- projected gradient, Nesterov-accelerated gradient, ADMM, and an interior-point reference implemented in CVXPY -- and evaluate the learned schemes in time-dependent one-dimensional Maxwell simulations using a Crank--Nicolson (CN) time discretization. Our numerical experiments show that (i) energy-constrained learned stencils achieve accuracy comparable to standard central differences while exactly preserving the discrete electromagnetic energy under CN time-stepping, and (ii) ADMM and interior-point methods produce nearly identical operators, with ADMM offering a favorable tradeoff between accuracy, constraint satisfaction, and runtime."}

Any comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper studies a two-phase free boundary problem governed by the ElectroHydroDynamic equations, which describes a perfectly conducting, incompressible, irrotational fluid with gravity, surrounded by a dielectric gas. The interface separating fluid and gas is referred to as the free boundary. \nIt is known that the free surface remains smooth away from the stagnation points, where the relative velocity of the incompressible fluid vanishes. In the presence of gravity, the Stokes conjecture, proved by Varvaruca and Weiss [Acta. Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. \nOur main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile. If the decay rate is slower than the critical decay rate, the electric field dominates and completely destroys the corner structure, resulting in a cusp singularity. The analysis of these singularities relies on variational principles and geometric methods. Key technical tools include a Weiss-type monotonicity formula, a frequency formula, and a concentration-compactness argument."}

The spectral stability of these waves is then rigorously addressed. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operator around the wave of fixed period. A key element in this analysis is the monotonicity of the period map, which, when combined with Morse index theory, enables us to fully characterize the non-positive spectrum of the projected operator in the space of zero-mean periodic functions.

The main difficulty in dimension d $\\ge$ 3 are the magnetic Bernstein inequalities which, in comparison to the twodimensional case, lead to additional complications and require more delicate estimates. Our results have immediate consequences for control theory, spectral theory and mathematical physics which we comment on."}

We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines."}

By applying Lie group analysis, we construct self-similar solutions and derive a reduced system of ordinary differential equations. Using comparison principles and barrier techniques, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of global-in-time solutions in both slow-diffusion ($γ_i > 0$) and fast-diffusion ($γ_i < 0$) regimes. Detailed asymptotic analysis near the diffusion front reveals power-law behavior of concentration profiles, with explicit expressions for the decay exponents. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, demonstrating the spatio-temporal evolution of reactant concentrations under realistic parameter values.

This article is dedicated to the memory of Haïm Brezis whose life and work were a great source of inspiration", "summary": "We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."}

More precisely, we integrate the extended finite element (X-FEM) discretization into the FFT-based framework, leveraging its ability to resolve discontinuities via additional shape functions. We employ the modified abs(olute) enrichment and develop a preconditioner based on the concept of strongly stable GFEM, which mitigates the conditioning issues observed in traditional X-FEM implementations.

In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks."}
