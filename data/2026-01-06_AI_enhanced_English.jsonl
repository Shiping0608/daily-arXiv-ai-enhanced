While Flow Matching (FM) offers a powerful paradigm for constructing continuous-time transport maps, its deployment in high-precision integration is severely limited by the discretization bias inherent to numerical ODE solvers and the lack of rigorous convergence guarantees when coupled with Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. This paper addresses these critical gaps by proposing Flow Matching Importance Sampling Quasi-Monte Carlo (FM-ISQMC), a framework designed to transform biased generative flows into unbiased, high-order integration schemes. Methodologically, we construct a transport map by composing a logistic base transformation with an Euler-discretized neural ODE field and employ importance sampling to correct for residual transport errors. Our central contribution is twofold. First, we establish a general convergence analysis for QMC importance sampling with arbitrary transport maps, identifying sufficient growth conditions for the $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error rate. Second, we rigorously prove that the specific transport architecture of Flow Matching satisfies these conditions. Consequently, we establish a $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error for the unbiased FM-ISQMC estimator, extending classical QMC theory to the realm of generative models.

Recent experiments on the Joint European Torus (JET) have explored this scenario at higher pre-disruptive plasma currents than are achievable on other devices, revealing challenges in obtaining benign terminations at $I_p \\geq 2.5$ MA. This work analyzes the evolution of these high-current RE beams and their terminating MHD events using fast magnetic sensor measurements and EFIT equilibrium reconstructions for approximately $40$ JET and $20$ DIII-D tokamak discharges. On JET, unsuccessful non-benign terminations occur at low edge safety factor ($q_{\\text{edge}} \\approx 2$), and are preceded by intermittent, non-terminating MHD events at higher rational $q_{\\text{edge}}$. Trends in the internal inductance $l_i$ indicate more peaked RE current profiles in the high-$I_p$ non-benign population, which may hinder successful recombination through re-ionization. In contrast, benign terminations on JET typically occur at higher $q_{\\text{edge}} \\geq 3$ and exhibit less peaked RE current profiles. DIII-D displays a range of terminating edge safety factors, correlated with the measured $l_i$ values. Across both tokamaks, the RE current peaking is therefore found to determine which MHD instability boundary is encountered, confirmed by linear resistive MHD modeling with the CASTOR3D code. Measured growth rates are similar for benign and non-benign cases, indicating that ideal MHD timescales at low density after hydrogenic injection do not alone explain efficient RE deconfinement.

Any comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper studies a two-phase free boundary problem governed by the ElectroHydroDynamic equations, which describes a perfectly conducting, incompressible, irrotational fluid with gravity, surrounded by a dielectric gas. The interface separating fluid and gas is referred to as the free boundary. \nIt is known that the free surface remains smooth away from the stagnation points, where the relative velocity of the incompressible fluid vanishes. In the presence of gravity, the Stokes conjecture, proved by Varvaruca and Weiss [Acta. Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. \nOur main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile.

Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp.

These formulas involve horizontal Ricci curvature, torsion and vertical mean curvature terms intrinsic to the foliated structure. From these identities, we establish generalized curvature dimension inequalities, extending earlier results in sub-Riemannian geometry.

In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proves fundamental limitations on passive cloaking devices, showing they cannot make dielectric inclusions invisible over finite frequency intervals in the quasistatic regime, and provides quantitative bounds on cloaking effectiveness.", "motivation": "To address the fundamental question of whether passive cloaks can make dielectric inclusions invisible over finite frequency intervals in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations, and to establish theoretical limits on cloaking capabilities.", "method": "Uses Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map analysis with two key approaches: 1) variational principles from composite theory via a new representation theorem for DtN maps, and 2) analytic methods connecting DtN maps to Herglotz and Stieltjes functions using passivity assumptions and sum rules.", "result": "Provides negative answer to the possibility of passive cloaking over finite frequency intervals, establishes quantitative bounds on DtN maps involving physical parameters (frequency interval, device/obstacle volumes, permittivity), and shows fundamental limitations for both exact and approximate cloaking in lossy and lossless cases.", "conclusion": "Passive cloaking devices have fundamental theoretical limitations that prevent them from achieving perfect invisibility over finite frequency intervals, with derived bounds providing quantitative constraints on cloaking performance based on physical parameters."}}
