The model extends the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to account for the electric properties of the flowing plasma gas and its reaction to the applied magnetic field. The model takes into account various effects, such as the Lorentz force, turbulence, compressibility, and energy extraction from the plasma, and it adopts an electric potential technique along with the low magnetic Reynolds number (Rem) approximation. The model is numerically implemented using the multiphysics open-source computer programming environment \"OpenFOAM,\" which combines the finite volume method (FVM) and the object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating the supersonic channel of the large-scale pulsed MHD generator (PMHDG) called \"Sakhalin\", with the aid of collected data and empirical expressions in the literature about its tested operation. Sakhalin was the world's largest PMHDG, with a demonstrated peak electric power output of 510 MW. Sakhalin operated on solid-propellant plasma (SPP), and it had a single supersonic divergent Faraday-type continuous-electrode channel with a length of 4.5 m. We check the validity of the model through comparisons with independent results for the Sakhalin PMHDG. Then, we process our three-dimensional simulation results to provide scalar characteristics of the Sakhalin channel, one-dimensional profiles along the longitudinal centerline, and three-dimensional distributions in the entire channel."}

Previous NIF experiments have shown yield and hotspot temperature to increase in magnetized, gas-filled capsules in line with scalings. In this work, we use the 2D radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Lasnex with a Livermore ICF common model. Simulations are tuned to closely approximate data from unmagnetized experiments. Investigated here is the effect of imposed axial fields of up to 100 T on the fusion output of high-performing ICF shots, specifically the record BigFoot shot N180128, and HYBRID-E shots N210808 and N221204. The main observed effect is an increase in the hotspot temperature due to magnetic insulation. Namely, electron heat flow is constrained perpendicular to the magnetic field and alpha trajectories transition to gyro-orbits, enhancing energy deposition. In addition, we investigate the impact of applied magnetic fields to future NIF designs, specifically an example Enhanced Yield Capability design with 3 MJ of laser energy as well as a high-\\r{ho}R, low implosion velocity \"Pushered Single Shell\" design. In conclusion, magnetization with field strengths of 5-75 T is found to increase the burn-averaged ion temperature by 50% and the neutron yield by 2-12. Specifically, we see yield enhancement of at least 50% with only a 5-10 T applied magnetic field for N221204, while a 65 T field on N210808 with symmetrization gives an 8 increase in yield. This is all without further design optimization to best take advantage of an applied B field, which promises even greater improvements for designs tailored specifically towards magnetization."}

Based on the architecture FieldFlow-Net, this model combines a multi-resolution 3D U-Net encoder-decoder that operates on evolving plasma potential fields. A dilated temporal convolutional network (TCN) learns the nonlinear time evolution of latent turbulence features. GKFieldFlow simultaneously (i) predicts ion and electron energy fluxes, and particle flux directly from CGYRO turbulence, and (ii) predicts future potential fields autoregressively with desired spatial resolution. This enables the model to replicate both instantaneous transport and the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics that generate it.\n  The architecture is physics-informed in its design: 3D convolutions preserve the anisotropic geometry and phase structure of gyrokinetic fluctuations, while dilated temporal convolutions capture multiscale dynamical couplings such as turbulence and zonal-flow interactions, turbulence decorrelation, and intermittent bursty transport. We provide a complete technical description of the data structure, model components, and rationale behind each architectural choice.\n  The model achieves high accuracy across all three transport channels, with multi-horizon inference maintaining robustness. Autoregressive field rollouts preserve the spectral content, phase coherence, and energy distribution of the CGYRO nonlinear state with strong fidelity, and flux predictions remain consistent with CGYRO within a small fractional error. This work presents GKFieldFlow as a data-driven reduced model that can jointly learn turbulence dynamics and transport."}

VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \\[ \\mathcal{L}u = f \\quad \\text{in} \\quad Q=Ω\\times(0,T), \\] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space-time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \\[ u_N(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\\,φ_n(x,t), \\] where $φ_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling."}

We consider spatial domains with smooth boundaries and formulate both linear and nonlinear BCs using mass flux, Riemann's invariants, and Bernoulli's potential, ensuring that the resulting initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is provably entropy- and energy-stable. The linear analysis is comprehensive, providing sufficient conditions to establish the existence, uniqueness, and energy stability of solutions to the linear IBVP. For the nonlinear IBVP, which admits more general solutions, our goal is to develop nonlinear BCs that guarantee entropy stability. We introduce the concepts of linear consistency and linear stability for nonlinear IBVPs, demonstrating that if a nonlinear IBVP is both linearly consistent and linearly stable, then, for sufficiently regular initial and boundary data over a finite time interval, a unique smooth solution exists. Both the linear and nonlinear IBVPs can be efficiently solved using high-order accurate numerical methods.

We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders.

In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria."}

The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples.

We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus.

These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases. We also provide a nonexistence result as a consequence of a Pohozaev-type identity.

The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance. PFEM is validated on a broad range of benchmark problems, including linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity with complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and arbitrary boundary conditions.

The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay.

The classical hyperbolic system is regularized by a third-order dispersive term in the momentum equation, which renders the system equivalent, via the Madelung transform, to a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a drift term induced by bottom topography.\n  Instead of solving the shallow water equations directly, we solve the associated Schrödinger equation and recover the hydrodynamic variables through a simple postprocessing procedure. This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schrödinger regularization provides an $O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter. Importantly, we observe that this convergence behavior persists even in the presence of moving wetting--drying interfaces, where vacuum states emerge and standard shallow water solvers often encounter difficulties. These results suggest that the Schrödinger-based formulation offers a robust and promising alternative framework for the numerical simulation of shallow water flows with dry states."}
