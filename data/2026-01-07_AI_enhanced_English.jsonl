The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay.
