Unlike traditional operator learning models such as DeepONet and Fourier Neural Operator, which require large paired datasets and often struggle near sharp features, our approach minimizes the residual of a DG-based weak formulation using the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) scheme. DG-FEONet predicts element-wise solution coefficients via a neural network, enabling data-free training without the need for precomputed input-output pairs. We provide theoretical justification through convergence analysis and validate the model's performance on a series of one- and two-dimensional PDE problems, demonstrating accurate recovery of discontinuities, strong generalization across parameter space, and reliable convergence rates. Our results highlight the potential of combining local discretization schemes with machine learning to achieve robust, singularity-aware operator approximation in challenging PDE settings."}

Such high compression, in turn, enables efficient high-dimensional computations. Exact TT representations are only available for simple analytic functions. Furthermore, global polynomial or Fourier expansions typically yield TT-ranks that grow proportionally with the number of basis terms. State-of-the-art methods are often prohibitively expensive or fail to recover the underlying low-rank structure. We propose a low-rank TT interpolation framework that, given a TT describing a discrete (scalar-, vector-, or tensor-valued) function on a coarse regular grid with $n$ cores, constructs a finer-scale version of the same function represented by a TT with $n+m$ cores, where the last $m$ cores maintain constant rank. Our method guarantees a $\\ell^{2}$-norm error bound independent of the total number of cores, achieves exponential compression at fixed accuracy, and admits logarithmic complexity with respect of the number of grid points. We validate its performance through numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D applications such as: 2D and 3D airfoil mask embeddings, image super-resolution, and synthetic noise fields such as 3D synthetic turbulence. In particular, we generate fractal noise fields directly in TT format with logarithmic complexity and memory. This work opens a path to scalable TT-native solvers with complex geometries and multiscale generative models, with implications from scientific simulation to imaging and real-time graphics."}

In the standard method we use splines of degree $p$ such that we can control the smoothness of the basis functions easily, but do not take any interface location into consideration. This includes for p=1 the usual hat basis functions. In the enriched method we additionally capture the interface locations in the ansatz space by enrichment functions. For both discretization methods shape and topological sensitivity analysis is performed. It turns out that the regularity of the shape derivative depends on the regularity of the basis functions. Furthermore, for point-wise convergence of the shape derivative the interface has to be considered in the ansatz space. For the topological derivative we show that only the enriched method converges."}

Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem."}

For concreteness, we invoke deuterium-tritium (DT) as fuels. The intense electromagnetic field trapped inside the soliton significantly enhances the DT-fusion cross section, its ponderomotive potential evacuates electrons, and it accelerates D/T to kinetic energies suitable for fusion reaction. While electrons are expelled almost instantly, the much heavier D/T moves at picosecond time scale. Such a difference in time scales renders a time window for DT fusion to occur efficiently in an electron-free environment. We inject two consecutive lasers, where the first would excite plasma solitons and the second, much more intense and with a matched lower frequency, would fortify the soliton electromagnetic field resonantly. We impose a plasma density gradient to induce soliton motion. All D/T inside the plasma column swept by the moving soliton during its lifetime would participate in this fusion mechanism. We show that the breakeven condition is attainable. Invoking fiber laser and the iCAN laser technologies for high repetition rate and high intensity operation, gigawatt output maybe conceivable."}

In the context of Bayesian inverse problems with linear forward models, Gaussian priors, and Gaussian noise, we use perturbation theory for inverses to bound the error in the approximate posterior mean and posterior covariance resulting from a linear approximate forward model. We then focus on the smoothing problem of inferring the initial condition of linear time-invariant dynamical systems, using finitely many partial state observations. For such problems, and for a specific model order reduction method based on balanced truncation, we show that the impulse response of a certain prior-driven system is closely related to the prior-preconditioned Hessian of the inverse problem. This reveals a novel connection between systems theory and inverse problems. We exploit this connection to prove the first a priori error bounds for system-theoretic model order reduction methods applied to smoothing problems. The bounds control the approximation error of the posterior mean and covariance in terms of the truncated Hankel singular values of the underlying system."}

Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments."}

Another puzzling phenomenon is temperature inversion in the solar corona. These two issues are deeply connected. We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) for electromagnetically driven kinetic plasmas, deriving a Fokker-Planck equation for the simultaneous relaxation of multiple species, with (i) a drive diffusion coefficient for the heating of dressed particles directly by the drive and indirectly by waves, and (ii) Balescu-Lenard diffusion and drag coefficients for internal turbulence and Coulomb collisions. Both electron and ion distributions relax towards a universal attractor with a $v^{-5}$ $(E^{-2})$ tail, akin to a $κ= 1.5$ distribution, under a super-Debye (but sub-Larmor) drive with a steep power-spectrum. This is an outcome of Debye screening: large-scale fields accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. The universality may be broken by shallow power-spectra and incomplete relaxation. Collisions cannot decelerate suprathermal particles, rendering a high $v$ tail immune to Maxwellianization. Such a tail may be generated in the solar corona by chromospheric convection despite collisional losses. The suprathermal particles escape sun's gravity (velocity filtration), inverting the temperature profile and raising it to $10^6$ K. A proper analysis of velocity filtration with a $κ\\approx 1.5-2$ distribution inspired by QLT provides a reasonable fit to the spectroscopic data of heavy ions and explains the abrupt temperature rise, a consequence of the divergence of pressure in the $κ\\to 1.5$ limit."}

The classical Arps decline family is generalized for geothermal use by introducing an equilibrium-temperature term motivated by Newton-type cooling, ensuring finite late-time temperature limits while reducing exactly to the conventional Arps forms when the equilibrium term is set to zero. The extended decline curves are validated against Utah FORGE downhole temperature measurements and then used to construct learning surrogates on a controlled THM dataset spanning fracture count, well spacing, fracture spacing, host-rock thermal conductivity, and circulation rate. An equation-informed neural network embeds the modified decline equations as differentiable internal computational layers to produce full 0-60 month temperature trajectories from design and operational inputs.

First we review and relate the use of local spectral problems in distinct fields of literature on AMG, domain decomposition (DD), and multiscale finite elements. We then propose a new approach blending aggregation-based coarsening, overlapping Schwarz smoothers, and locally constructed spectral coarse spaces. By exploiting the factorized structure of $A$, we construct an inexpensive symmetric positive semidefinite splitting that yields local generalized eigenproblems whose solutions define sparse, nonoverlapping coarse basis functions. This enables a fully algebraic and naturally recursive multilevel hierarchy that can either coarsen slowly to achieve AMG-like operator complexities, or coarsen aggressively-with correspondingly larger local spectral problems-to ensure robustness on problems that cannot be solved by existing AMG methods. The method requires no geometric information, avoids global eigenvalue solves, and maintains efficient parallelizable setup through localized operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed least-squares AMG-DD method achieves convergence rates independent of anisotropy on rotated diffusion problems and remains scalable with problem size, while for small amounts of anisotropy we obtain convergence and operator complexities comparable with classical AMG methods. Most notably, for extremely anisotropic heat conduction operators arising in magnetic confinement fusion, where AMG and smoothed aggregation fail to reduce the residual even marginally, our method provides robust and efficient convergence across many orders of magnitude in anisotropy strength."}

In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii."}

In such systems, agents interact through weighted graphs whose structure evolves over time in a coupled manner with the agents' states, leading to non-exchangeable dynamics. In the dense-graph regime, we show that the asymptotic behavior is described by a Vlasov-type equation posed on an extended phase space that includes both the agents' states and identities and the evolving interaction weights. We establish this limiting equation through two complementary approaches. The first follows the mean-field methodology in the spirit of Sznitman [28]. In this framework, we impose the additional assumption that the weight dynamics is independent of one of the agent's states, an assumption that remains well motivated from a modeling perspective and allows for a direct derivation of the mean-field limit. The second approach is based on the graph limit framework and is formulated in a deterministic setting. This perspective makes it possible to remove the aforementioned restriction on the weight dynamics and to handle more general interaction structures. Our analysis includes wellposedness and stability results for the limiting Vlasov-type equation, as well as quantitative estimates ensuring the propagation of independence. We further clarify the relationship between the continuum (graph limit) formulation and the mean-field limit, thereby providing a unified description of the asymptotic dynamics of interacting particle systems on adaptive dynamical networks."}

We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions."}

Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems."}

The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria.

In sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case, where $(-1)$-homogeneous vector fields are locally square-integrable, the 2D problem is critical in the sense that the initial kinetic energy is locally infinite at the origin, and the initial vorticity fails to be locally integrable. Consequently, the classical local energy estimates are not available. To overcome this, we decompose the solution into a linear part solving the heat equation and a finite-energy perturbation part. By exploiting a kind of inherent cancellation relation between the linear part and the perturbation part, we can control interaction terms and establish the $H^1$-estimates for the perturbation part. Further investigating the corresponding Leray system in weighted Sobolev space, we can derive an optimal pointwise estimate. This gives the faster decay of the perturbation part at infinity and enables us to construct global-in-time self-similar solutions."}

For a background field which is nearly radial this causes an outwardly propagating jet to form. Switchbacks and their characteristic velocity jets have recently been observed to be nearly ubiquitous by Parker Solar Probe with in situ measurements in the inner heliosphere within 0.3 AU. Their prevalence, substantial energy content, and potentially fundamental role in the dynamics of the outer corona and solar wind motivate the significant research efforts into their understanding. Here we review the in situ measurements of these structures (primarily by Parker Solar Probe). We discuss how they are identified and measured, and present an overview of the primary observational properties of these structures, both in terms of individual switchbacks and their collective arrangement into ``patches''. We identify both properties for which there is a strong consensus and those that have limited or qualified support and require further investigation.

Three documented events (2014, 2017, 2020) were simulated using WRF downscaling of ERA reanalyses and validated with tide-gauge and microbarograph observations. Both models are limited by the underestimation of mesoscale pressure disturbances in the atmospheric forcing.

In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $ψ(t)=t^α/α$ and prove that every $C_0$--$α$-semigroup $\\{T_α(t)\\}_{t\\ge0}$ can be written as $T_α(t)=T(ψ(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\\{T(s)\\}_{s\\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $α$-hypercyclicity and $α$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,α}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time."}

Specifically, the solid's displacement is subject to Dirichlet- and Neumann-type conditions on different portions of its boundary and possibly non-zero body forces and initial data. Our regularity results are reminiscent of the so-called \"hidden trace regularity\" results for solutions to the scalar wave equation obtained in [12]."}

Differential Equ.), Lou proved that, once the intrinsic growth rate $r$ in the logistic model is proportional to the spatially heterogeneous carrying capacity $K$ ($r=K^1$), the total population under the regular diffusion exceeds the total of the carrying capacity. He also conjectured that the dependency of the total population on the diffusion coefficient is unimodal, increasing to its maximum and then decreasing to the asymptote which is the total of the carrying capacity. DeAngelis et al (J. Math. Biol. 2016) argued that the prevalence of the population over the carrying capacity is only observed when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are positively correlated, at least for slow dispersal. Guo et al (J. Math. Biol. 2020) justified that, once $r$ is constant ($r=K^0$), the total population is less than the cumulative carrying capacity. Our paper fills up the gap for when $r=K^λ$ for any real $λ$, disproving an assumption that there is a critical $λ^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$ at which the tendency of the prevalence of the carrying capacity over the total population size changes, demonstrating instead that the relationship is more complicated. In addition, we explore the dependency of the total population size on the diffusion coefficient when the third parameter of the dispersal strategy $P$ is involved: the diffusion term is $d Δ(u/P)$, not just $d Δu$, for any $λ$. We outline some differences from the random diffusion case, in particular, concerning the profile of the total population as a function of the diffusion coefficient."}

Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights."}
