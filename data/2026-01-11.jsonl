Developing stable and rapidly converging vectorwise eigensolvers is a crucial step in improving the overall efficiency of their blockwise implementations. The present paper is concerned with the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method for Hermitian eigenvalue problems, and motivated by two recently proposed alternatives for its single-vector version LOPCG. A common basis of these eigensolvers is the well-known CG method for linear systems. However, the optimality of CG search directions cannot perfectly be transferred to CG-like eigensolvers. In particular, while computing clustered eigenvalues, LOPCG and its alternatives suffer from frequent delays, leading to a staircase-shaped convergence behavior which cannot be explained by the existing estimates. Keeping this in mind, we construct a class of cluster robust vector iterations where LOPCG is replaced by asymptotically equivalent two-term recurrences and the search directions are timely corrected by selecting a far previous iterate as augmentation. The new approach significantly reduces the number of required steps and the total computational time."}

In particular, linear approximation frameworks-such as spectral, finite-difference, or discontinuous Galerkin methods-often suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations or require carefully tuned stabilization mechanisms, whose effectiveness degrades in transport-dominated and long-time integration regimes. In this work, we introduce a sequential-in-time nonlinear parametrization (STNP) for solving fractional Burgers equations, including models with a fractional Laplacian or with nonlocal nonlinear fluxes. The solution is represented by a nonlinear parametric ansatz, and the parameter evolution is obtained by projecting the governing dynamics onto the tangent space of the parameter manifold through a regularized least-squares formulation at each time step. This yields a well-posed and stable time-marching scheme that preserves causality and avoids global-in-time optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting projected dynamics, including a stability estimate and an a posteriori error bound that explicitly decomposes the total error into contributions from initial condition fitting, projection residuals, and discretization of fractional operators. Our analysis clarifies the stabilizing role of regularization and quantifies its interaction with the nonlocal discretization error. Numerical experiments for both fractional Burgers models demonstrate that STNP achieves oscillation-free shock resolution and accurately captures long-time dynamics. The method consistently outperforms high-order spectral schemes augmented with spectral vanishing viscosity, while requiring significantly fewer degrees of freedom and avoiding ad hoc stabilization."}

To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution.

In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%.

In both solution reconstruction and inverse problems, model parameters are estimated with the help of measurement data. In practice, experimentalists seek to design experiments such that the acquired data leads to the most robust recovery of the missing parameters in a subsequent inverse problem. While there are well-established techniques for designing experiments with standard approaches to the inverse problem, optimal experimental design (OED) has yet to be explored with the ECFM formulation. In this work, we investigate OED with a constraint force objective. First, we review traditional approaches to OED based on the Fisher information matrix, and propose an analogous formulation based on constraint forces. Next, we reflect on the different interpretations of the objective from standard and constraint force-based inverse problems. We then test our method on several example problems. These examples suggest that an experiment which is optimal in the sense of constraint forces tends to position measurements in the stiffest regions of the system. Because the responses -- and thus the measurements -- are small in these regions, this strategy is impractical in the presence of measurement noise and/or finite measurement precision. As such, our provisional conclusion is that ECFM is not a viable approach to OED."}

The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.\n  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.\n  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.\n  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation."}

To study the influence of dose reduction on clinical dark-field radiographs, one can simulate low-dose images by virtually reducing the irradiated area. However, these simulations can exhibit stripe artifacts. Purpose: Validation of the low-dose simulation algorithm reported by Schick & Bast et al., PLoS ONE, 2024. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate that stripe artifacts observed in simulated images at very low-dose levels are introduced by limitations of the algorithm and would not appear in actual low-dose dark-field images. Methods: Dark-field radiographs of an anthropomorphic chest phantom were acquired at different tube currents equaling different radiation doses. Based on the measurement with a high radiation dose, dark-field radiographs corresponding to lower radiation doses were simulated by virtually reducing the irradiated area. The simulated low-dose radiographs were evaluated by a quantitative comparison of the dark-field signal using different regions of interests. Results: Dark-field radiographs acquired at one quarter of the standard dose were artifact-free. The dark-field signal differed from the simulated radiographs by up to 10%. Algorithm-induced stripe artifacts decrease the image quality of the simulated radiographs. Conclusions: Virtually reducing the irradiation area is a simple approach to generate low-dose radiographs based on images acquired with scanning-based dark-field radiography. However, as the algorithm creates stripe artifacts in the dark-field images, particularly at higher dose reductions, that are not present in measured low-dose images, simulated images have reduced image quality compared to their measured counterparts."}

We derive a specific form of the nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity explicitly appears in the time-derivative terms that govern the evolution of the mechanical fields. The numerical solution is established using a fully discrete formulation that combines the standard finite element method for spatial discretization with the implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT)-$α$ scheme for time integration. To address the nonlinear nature of the discrete system, we employ Newton's method to iteratively solve the linearized equations at each time step. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are rigorously verified through convergence analyses, which demonstrate optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study is conducted to elucidate the influence of the model's constitutive parameters. The results reveal that the magnitude parameter of the stress-dependent variation in wave speed leads to wavefront steepening and the formation of shock discontinuities. Conversely, the exponent parameter acts as a nonlinearity filter; high values suppress nonlinear effects in small-strain regimes, whereas low values allow significant dispersive behavior. This work provides a validated tool for analyzing shock formation in advanced nonlinear materials."}

Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb."}

We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems."}

However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al.

Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect.

In this work, we extend VarPro to solve minimization problems containing a differentiable regularization term on the nonlinear parameters, along with a general-form Tikhonov regularization term on the linear variables. Furthermore, we develop a quasi-Newton method for solving the resulting reduced problem, and provide a local convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions, establishing conditions for superlinear or quadratic convergence. For large-scale settings, we introduce an inexact LSQR-based variant and prove its local convergence despite inner-solve and Hessian approximations.

Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds.

This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks."}

We show that inclusion of the positive phases enforces a global ordering of the solutions. As a consequence, the positive phase uniquely determines the solution, and strict phase inclusion implies that the corresponding nodal sets are disjoint. Our analysis relies on a maximum principle for the linearized operator on unbounded domains that are not necessarily smooth, and yields an Allen--Cahn analogue of the strong maximum principle for minimal hypersurfaces."}

The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior."}

We showcase our theory with an application to rough reaction--diffusion equations. Subsequent articles will treat further classes of equations, including equations of Burgers-type and quasi-linear problems, using the same approach.

In both cases, we prove interior Lipschitz-estimates on a transport-like map and interior gradient Lipschitz-estimates on the potentials, under the assumption that the transport map solving the unregularised problem is bi-$C^{1,α}$-regular. For strictly subquadratic and entropic regularisation, the estimates improve to interior $C^1$ and $C^2$ estimates for the transport-like map and the potentials, respectively. Our estimates are uniform in the regularisation parameter. As a consequence of this, we obtain convergence of the transport-like map (resp. the potentials) to the unregularised transport map (resp. Kantorovich potentials) in $C^{0,1-}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ (resp. $C^{1,1-}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$).\n  Central to our approach are sharp local bounds on the size of the support for regularised optimal transport which we derive for a general convex, superlinear regularisation term. These bounds are of independent interest and imply global bias bounds for the regularised transport plans. Our global bounds, while not necessarily sharp, improve on the best known results in the literature for quadratic regularisation."}

Such simulations are ubiquitous in scientific computing, but the correctness of the results is usually not guaranteed. We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems."}
