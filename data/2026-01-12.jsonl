This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data."}

This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $ν$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $ν$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $ν\\ge 0$ with $ν\\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.\n  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort."}

However, despite decades of development, their accuracy has remained insufficient for many critical applications, particularly for simulating protein folding and the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Developing a transferable, data-driven ISM that overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical formulas remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy that distills the evolutionary information learned by a protein language model, ESM3, into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). We show that this GNN potential, trained on effective energies from ESM3, is robust enough to drive stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. When combined with a standard electrostatics term, our hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. This approach yields a single, unified model that is transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By successfully distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, our work delivers a foundational implicit solvent model poised to accelerate the development of predictive, large-scale simulation tools."}

However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies."}

Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.\n  Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target.

Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics."}

BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds).

The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories.

The objective is to quantitatively characterize the electric field in the vicinity of the high-voltage electrode during inception and the transition toward streamer formation. By averaging over a large number of discharge events and operating in a regime where the discharge remains statistically axisymmetric, the proposed approach enables reconstruction of the electric-field profiles with nanosecond resolution. The results show a rapid increase of the field during the first nanoseconds, followed by the formation of a shell-like structure exhibiting the highest reduced fields prior to destabilization. The reconstructed reduced electric-field magnitude reaches peak values in the range of approximately 230-270 Td, with an estimated uncertainty of about 20-30% associated with calibration and profile-shape effects. These values correspond to the regime where electron-impact excitation and photoionization processes become highly efficient, consistent with the observed transition from a stable inception cloud to streamer destabilization. After the onset of streamer branching, increasing asymmetry limits the applicability of the inversion, and the reconstructed fields represent averaged contributions rather than the local field at individual streamer heads. The methodology thus identifies the conditions under which quantitative E-field mapping is reliable and establishes a framework for extending electric-field diagnostics to the inception phase of nanosecond atmospheric discharges."}

We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation.

Two main stabilization mechanisms are found to be effective in ITG stabilization confirming previous studies: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective only at intermediate EP temperatures and dilution effect (DE) which is independent of EP temperature and becomes dominant in burning plasma regime ($T_f > 50T_i$). The study is further extended to slowing-down EP distributions which in contrast exhibit no DDRM-related stabilization. The findings are further validated in an ITER pre-fusion operation scenario and additionally compared with electromagnetic effects. In this scenario EP stabilization is found to be weaker than $β$-stabilization.

The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria."}

From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $ω(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|δE_\\parallel|/|δB_\\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|δE_\\parallel|/|δB_\\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere."}

Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform."}

For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona.

Secondly, from Molecular Dynamics simulations we extract the molecular reflection coefficient of single water molecules from the air-water interface. This parameter determines the water condensation and evaporation rate at a liquid droplet surface and therefore the evaporation rate of aqueous droplets. We find the reflection of water to be negligible at room temperature but to rise significantly at elevated temperatures and for grazing incidence angles. Thirdly, we derive a thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets that is formulated as a three-phase Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system. By numerically solving the coupled system of equations, we explore representative scenarios that show that this model reproduces and generalizes features of the sharp-interface model. These interconnected studies on the dynamics of aerosol droplet evaporation are relevant in order to quantitatively assess the airborne infection risk under varying environmental conditions."}

The models consist of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with singular diffusion forced by a phase-field. We investigate both the case of an independently evolving phase-field and of coupled phase-field evolution driven by a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Such systems are used in the modelling of single-cell chemotaxis, where the contour of the cell shape corresponds to a level set of the phase-field. The technical challenge lies in the singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field. For large classes of initial data, we establish global existence of probabilistically weak solutions in $L^2$-spaces with weights which compensate for the singularities."}

Our main result shows that, under a logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, it is given by the same explicit Gaussian Fixed point obtained in [G. Cannizzaro, Q. Moulard, & F. Toninelli, arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344, 2025] for the quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalised coefficients, thereby rigorously justifying and partly correcting the classical Physics derivation of the SBE in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, & H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] based on Spohn's theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. Besides, ours is the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of [M. Hairer, J. Quastel, Forum of Mathematics, Pi, Vol. 6, 2018, e3], to the critical dimension and beyond weak coupling. The major challenge in our work is the mild growth condition on the nonlinearity which renders even the well-posedness of the microscopic equation non-trivial. Additional key novelties include the derivation of fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator as well as a new approximation for the resolvent associated to the solution of the quadratic SBE."}

Previous works addressed this problem with noise of spatial regularity $α\\in (0,1/2)$, in a setting where a rougher noise yields a stronger regularization. We remove this limitation by allowing any $α\\in (0,1)$, covering the same range of parameters for which anomalous regularization effects are known to occur in passive scalars. In particular, this covers the physically relevant case $α=2/3$, associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade."}
