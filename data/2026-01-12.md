### [1] [Generalized Canonical Polyadic Tensor Decompositions with General Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05335)
*Alex Mulrooney,David Hong*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Symmetric Generalized Canonical Polyadic (SymGCP) decomposition extends GCP to handle symmetric tensors by enforcing symmetry constraints in the decomposition, enabling efficient computation and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CP and GCP decompositions don't explicitly account for tensor symmetry, which commonly arises in modern applications like dynamic graphs where adjacency matrices stacked over time exhibit symmetry along node modes.

Method: Develops SymGCP decomposition that allows symmetry along any subset of modes by enforcing corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. Derives gradients enabling efficient all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels, and creates stochastic approximations for scalability.

Result: Demonstrates utility through experiments on both synthetic and real data, showing SymGCP can handle various symmetry patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SymGCP provides a flexible framework for symmetric tensor decomposition that generalizes CP and GCP approaches, enabling better modeling of symmetric data structures with efficient computation and scalability.

Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a workhorse algorithm for discovering underlying low-dimensional structure in tensor data. This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data.

### [2] [Fast Algorithms for Optimal Damping in Mechanical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05404)
*Qingna Li,Françoise Tisseur*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Paper proposes two optimization methods (BBRMA and SPG) for finding optimal damping coefficients to maximize mechanical system decay rates, showing they require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than existing FODA method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimal damping aims to maximize decay rates in mechanical systems by finding optimal damping coefficients, but existing approaches may face stability issues and computational inefficiencies.

Method: Derived gradient/Hessian expressions for Lyapunov-based objective function; proposed Barzilai-Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA) and spectral projected gradient (SPG) method with stability constraints ν ≥ d.

Result: Both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than FODA; SPG converges faster than BBRMA despite line search overhead, leading to lower overall computational effort.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization methods efficiently solve optimal damping problems with stability guarantees, with SPG offering better convergence properties than BBRMA while outperforming existing FODA approach.

Abstract: Optimal damping aims at determining a vector of damping coefficients $ν$ that maximizes the decay rate of a mechanical system's response. This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $ν$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $ν$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $ν\ge 0$ with $ν\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.
  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort.

Method: Developed a mathematical model incorporating exciton dynamics and dissociation at bulk heterojunctions within active layer nanomorphology. Used phase field modeling to generate realistic morphologies. Employed finite element discretization with robust linear solvers and three numerical schemes (Newton, Gummel, and Semi-Newton-Gummel) to solve the coupled nonlinear system.

Conclusion: The developed computational framework provides a powerful tool for studying organic solar cell performance in silico, enabling device optimization and fundamental understanding through simulation of realistic morphologies and exciton dynamics.

Abstract: We present a pipeline to study the device performance of organic solar cells in silico. We introduce a mathematical model that includes the dynamics of excitons as well as their dissociation at bulk heterojunctions within the nanomorphology of the active layer. This is combined with realistic morphologies that we obtain from a detailed phase field model. To solve the coupled nonlinear system, we use a finite element discretization, robust linear solvers, and three numerical schemes, Newton, Gummel, and Semi--Newton--Gummel. This allows for an efficient simulation of the complete OPV device and results in current-voltage curves that can readily be compared to measured data.

### [4] [A semi-implicit DLN Galerkin finite element method for coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations with general nonlinearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05763)
*Zhen Guan,Xianxian Cao,Junjun Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Develops a semi-implicit Galerkin FEM for coupled generalized Ginzburg-Landau equations using DLN discretization, with novel analysis establishing unconditional optimal error estimates without requiring additional temporal discretization systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient numerical method for solving coupled generalized Ginzburg-Landau equations with rigorous error analysis that simplifies the theoretical argument compared to existing space-time error splitting techniques.

Method: Semi-implicit Galerkin finite element method based on the two-step DLN discretization scheme. Uses novel analytical technique with skillful application of inverse inequality and discrete Agmon inequality to analyze two cases (τ≤h and τ>h).

Result: Establishes boundedness of numerical solution in infinity norm and derives unconditionally optimal error estimates in L² and H¹ norms. Theoretical findings validated through three numerical examples covering both 2D and 3D scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method and analytical technique successfully solve coupled generalized Ginzburg-Landau equations with simplified theoretical argument, avoiding the need for additional temporal discretization systems while maintaining rigorous error estimates.

Abstract: In this paper, based on the two-step discretization scheme proposed by Dahlquist, Liniger and Nevanlinna (DLN), we develop a semi-implicit Galerkin finite element method for solving the coupled generalized Ginzburg-Landau equations. By virtue of a novel analytical technique, the boundedness of the numerical solution in the infinity norm is established, upon which the unconditionally optimal error estimates in the $L^2$ and $H^1$-norms are further derived. Compared with the space-time error splitting technique commonly adopted in the literature, the analytical method proposed in this paper does not require the introduction of an additional temporal discretization system, thus greatly simplifying the theoretical argument. The core point of the argument lies in the skillful application of the inverse inequality and discrete Agmon inequality to analyze the two cases, namely $τ\leq h$ and $τ>h$, respectively. Three numerical examples covering both two- and three-dimensional scenarios are eventually provided for the validation of the theoretical findings.

### [5] [Preconditioned log-determinant approximation: one Gaussian probe vector is almost always enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05778)
*Alice Cortinovis,Daniele Toni*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Randomized algorithms for estimating log-determinant of regularized SPD matrices using matrix-vector products, preconditioning, and stochastic trace estimation with adaptive sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient methods to estimate log-determinants of large regularized SPD matrices, which are computationally expensive for large-scale problems. Existing methods may be inefficient or inaccurate.

Method: Uses Nyström preconditioner with stochastic trace estimator. Combines heavy preconditioning with rough residual estimation using single-sample stochastic Lanczos quadrature (SLQ). Includes adaptive algorithm that detects when this strategy is ineffective and uses more SLQ samples.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows effectiveness of preconditioning-plus-rough-estimation strategy. Numerical experiments demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing algorithms on various test matrices.

Conclusion: Proposed randomized algorithms provide efficient and accurate log-determinant estimation for regularized SPD matrices, with adaptive strategy ensuring robustness across different matrix types.

Abstract: We present randomized algorithms for estimating the log-determinant of regularized symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. The algorithms access the matrix only through matrix vector products, and are based on the introduction of a preconditioner and stochastic trace estimator. We claim that preconditioning as much as we can and making a rough estimate of the residual part with a small budget achieves a small error in most of the cases. We choose a Nyström preconditioner and estimate the residual using only one sample of stochastic Lanczos quadrature (SLQ). We analyze the performance of this strategy from a theoretical and practical viewpoint. We also present an algorithm that, at almost no additional cost, detects whether the proposed strategy is not the most effective, in which case it uses more samples for the SLQ part. Numerical examples on several test matrices show that our proposed methods are competitive with existing algorithms.

### [6] [Stability and convergence analysis of unconditionally original energy dissipative implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta methods for the phase field crystal models without Lipschitz assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05780)
*Xiaoli Li,Kaiyi Niu,Jiang Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper develops a general framework for high-order IMEX Runge-Kutta methods that preserve energy dissipation for phase field crystal models with sixth-order derivatives and strongly nonlinear terms, enabling unconditional stability and optimal error estimates without Lipschitz assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The phase field crystal (PFC) method is important for simulating crystalline microstructures but presents challenges due to sixth-order derivatives and strongly nonlinear terms. Existing methods struggle with developing high-order stable schemes and establishing error estimates for such models.

Method: Develops a general framework for high-order IMEX Runge-Kutta methods using auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations. Proves solution equivalence between auxiliary and original models using Sobolev embedding and Cauchy's interlace theorem. Establishes uniform boundedness in L-infinity norm and unconditional stability.

Result: Achieves unconditional global-in-time stability and optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimates without Lipschitz assumptions or constraints on time-step/mesh size. The framework simplifies error estimation and can be extended to various gradient flows including Allen-Cahn equations and epitaxial thin film growth models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an elegant and simplified approach for high-order stable numerical schemes for PFC and related gradient flow models, enabling unconditional energy dissipation and optimal error estimates without requiring Lipschitz continuity assumptions.

Abstract: The phase field crystal (PFC) method is an efficient technique for simulating the evolution of crystalline microstructures at atomistic length scales and diffusive time scales. Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics.

### [7] [Domain-of-dependence-stabilized cut-cell discretizations of linear kinetic models with summation-by-parts properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05817)
*Louis Petri,Sigrun Ortleb,Gunnar Birke,Christian Engwer,Hendrik Ranocha*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: SBP framework extends domain-of-dependence stabilization for cut cells to linear kinetic models in diffusion scaling, focusing on telegraph equation with heat equation limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical methods for kinetic models face challenges with stiffness for small scaling parameters and need asymptotic preservation for parabolic limit equations like heat equation.

Method: Use summation-by-parts (SBP) framework with domain-of-dependence stabilization for cut cells, applied to telegraph equation with periodic boundary conditions. Employ both central and upwind numerical fluxes to generate periodic SBP operators.

Result: Proved semidiscrete stability for arbitrary periodic SBP operators, showed fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving, demonstrated DoD stabilization leads to stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for telegraph equation.

Conclusion: Domain-of-dependence stabilization with SBP framework provides stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for kinetic models in diffusion scaling, validated numerically and applicable to implicit time integration in heat equation limit.

Abstract: We employ the summation-by-parts (SBP) framework to extend the recent domain-of-dependence (DoD) stabilization for cut cells to linear kinetic models in diffusion scaling. Numerical methods for these models are challenged by increased stiffness for small scaling parameters and the necessity of asymptotics preservation regarding a parabolic limit equation. As a prototype model, we consider the telegraph equation in one spatial dimension subject to periodic boundary conditions with an asymptotic limit given by the linear heat equation. We provide a general semidiscrete stability result for this model when spatially discretized by arbitrary periodic (upwind) SBP operators and formally prove that the fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving. Moreover, we prove that DoD with central numerical fluxes leads to periodic SBP operators. Furthermore, we show that adapting the upwind DoD scheme yields periodic upwind SBP operators. Consequently, the DoD stabilization possesses the desired properties considered in the first part of this work and thus leads to a stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for the telegraph equation. We back our theoretical results with numerical simulations and demonstrate the applicability of this cut-cell stabilization for implicit time integration in the heat equation limit.

### [8] [An unfitted finite element method for elliptic interface problem with low regularity estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05837)
*Fanyi Yang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Unfitted FEM for elliptic interface problems with C²/polygonal interfaces, using local polynomial extension + ghost penalties for stability, enabling robust error estimates even for low-regularity solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a stable and accurate unfitted finite element method for elliptic interface problems where the interface may be C²-smooth or polygonal, handling solutions with potentially low regularity (u ∈ H¹⁺ˢ(Ω₀∪Ω₁) for any s > 0).

Method: Unfitted FEM with local polynomial extension technique combined with ghost penalty bilinear forms for stability near interface; jump penalty term defined via local polynomial extension for weakly enforcing jump conditions.

Result: Derived robust condition number estimates and error estimates; established error estimation particularly for solutions with low regularity; validated method through 2D and 3D numerical tests showing accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed unfitted FEM with local polynomial extension and ghost penalties provides stable, accurate solutions for elliptic interface problems, even with low-regularity solutions and various interface geometries.

Abstract: In this paper, we present and analyze an unfitted finite element method for the elliptic interface problem. We consider the case that the interface is $C^2$-smooth or polygonal, and the exact solution $u \in H^{1+s}(Ω_0 \cup Ω_1)$ for any $s > 0$. The stability near the interface is guaranteed by a local polynomial extension technique combined with ghost penalty bilinear forms, from which the robust condition number estimates and the error estimates are derived. Furthermore, the jump penalty term for weakly enforcing the jump condition in our method is also defined based on the local polynomial extension, which enables us to establish the error estimation particularly for solutions with low regularity. We perform a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.

### [9] [A dimension-independent critical exponent in a nutrient taxis system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05338)
*Michael Winkler*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes global existence vs. blow-up in a chemotaxis-consumption system with nonlinear diffusion, showing that diffusion coefficients decaying slower than (ξ+1)^{-1} guarantee global bounded solutions, while faster decay leads to finite-time blow-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish precise conditions on the nonlinear diffusion coefficient D(u) that determine whether solutions to the chemotaxis-consumption system remain globally bounded or experience finite-time blow-up, particularly focusing on the critical decay rate threshold.

Method: Analysis of a chemotaxis-consumption PDE system with no-flux boundary conditions for u and constant positive boundary data for v. The study considers radially symmetric initial data and examines the system under different assumptions about the diffusion coefficient D(u), specifically comparing cases where D(ξ) ≥ k_D(ξ+1)^{-α} with α < 1 versus D(ξ) ≤ K_D(ξ+1)^{-α} with α > 1.

Result: For diffusion coefficients satisfying D(ξ) ≥ k_D(ξ+1)^{-α} with α < 1, global bounded classical solutions exist for all nonnegative radially symmetric initial data. This complements previous results showing that for D(ξ) ≤ K_D(ξ+1)^{-α} with α > 1, finite-time blow-up occurs for some initial data.

Conclusion: The critical threshold for global existence in this chemotaxis-consumption system occurs at α = 1: diffusion decaying slower than (ξ+1)^{-1} ensures global bounded solutions, while faster decay allows for finite-time blow-up.

Abstract: In a ball $Ω\subset R^n$ with arbitrary $n\ge 1$, the chemotaxis-consumption system \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_t = \nabla \cdot \big(D(u)\nabla u\big) - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v), \\[1mm]
  0 = Δv - uv,
  \end{array} \right. \] is considered under no-flux boundary conditions for $u$, and for prescribed constant positive boundary data for $v$. Under the assumption that $D\in C^3([0,\infty))$ satisfies \[
  D(ξ)\ge k_D (ξ+1)^{-α}
  \qquad \mbox{for all } ξ\ge 0
  \qquad \qquad
  (\star) \] with some $α<1$ and some $k_D>0$, it is shown that for each nonnegative and radially symmetric $u_0\in \bigcup_{q>\max\{2,n\}} W^{1,q}(Ω)$, a uniquely determined global bounded classical solution exists.
  This complements a previous result according to which given any positive $D\in C^3([0,\infty))$ fulfilling $D(ξ) \le K_D (ξ+1)^{-α}$ with some $α>1$ and $K_D>0$, one can find nonnegative radial initial data $u_0\in C_0^\infty(Ω)$ such that no global solution exists.

### [10] [Threshold solutions for the $3d$ cubic INLS: the energy-subcritical case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05341)
*Luccas Campos,Luiz Gustavo Farah,Jason Murphy*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Extends classification of dynamics at ground state threshold for cubic inhomogeneous NLS from b∈(0,½) to full energy-subcritical range b∈(0,1) using modified modulation analysis and Strichartz estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work by Campos and Murphy (2023) only covered the range b∈(0,½) for classifying dynamics at ground state threshold. The authors aim to extend this result to the full energy-subcritical range b∈(0,1) for more complete understanding.

Method: Modified modulation analysis combined with Strichartz estimates (instead of pointwise bounds used in previous work). This approach allows handling the full parameter range while maintaining rigorous analysis.

Result: Successfully extended the classification of H¹ solution dynamics at ground state threshold to the full energy-subcritical range b∈(0,1) for cubic inhomogeneous NLS equations with singular potential |x|^{-b}|u|²u.

Conclusion: The modified approach using Strichartz estimates is effective for extending results to broader parameter ranges and is expected to be applicable to other dispersive equations with singular potentials.

Abstract: We revisit the work [L. Campos and J. Murphy, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55 (2023), pp. 3807--3843], which classified the dynamics of $H^1$ solutions at the ground state threshold for cubic inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equations of the form $i\partial_t u + Δu + |x|^{-b}|u|^2 u = 0$ in the range $b\in(0,\tfrac12)$. By modifying the modulation analysis and using Strichartz estimates in place of pointwise bounds, we extend the result to the full energy-subcritical range $b\in(0,1)$. This strategy is expected to carry over to other dispersive equations with singular potentials.

### [11] [Threshold solutions for the $3d$ cubic INLS: the energy-critical case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05349)
*Luccas Campos,Luiz Gustavo Farah,Jason Murphy*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves existence of special solutions W± with ground state energy for the 3D cubic inhomogeneous NLS with singular nonlinearity |x|⁻¹|u|²u, and uses them to characterize solution behavior near ground state energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the behavior of solutions to the energy-critical 3D cubic inhomogeneous NLS equation with singular nonlinearity |x|⁻¹|u|²u at the ground state energy level. The singular factor |x|⁻¹ creates mathematical challenges as it limits the smoothness of the ground state, requiring new analytical approaches.

Method: The authors develop a novel modulation analysis approach to handle the singular nonlinearity. They prove the existence of special solutions W± that have energy equal to that of the ground state W. These special solutions are then used as tools to characterize the behavior of general solutions near the ground state energy threshold.

Result: Main result is the existence of special solutions W± with energy equal to the ground state energy. These solutions provide a characterization of solution dynamics at the ground state energy level for the singular inhomogeneous NLS equation.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenges posed by the singular nonlinearity |x|⁻¹ in the 3D cubic NLS by developing new modulation techniques and constructing special solutions that characterize solution behavior at the critical ground state energy level.

Abstract: We study the energy-critical $3d$ cubic inhomogeneous NLS equation $i\partial_t u + Δu + |x|^{-1}|u|^2 u=0$. In this work, we prove the existence of special solutions $W^\pm$ with energy equal to that of the ground state $W$ and use these solutions to characterize the behavior of solutions at the ground state energy. The singular factor $|x|^{-1}$ in the nonlinearity significantly limits the smoothness of the ground state and prompts a novel approach to the modulation analysis.

*Montie Avery,Paul Carter,Björn de Rijk,Arnd Scheel*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes synchronization of relaxation oscillations in reaction-diffusion systems, focusing on phase waves with weak interactions of order ε^{8/3} and potential instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand synchronization phenomena in multiple-timescale reaction-diffusion systems, particularly resolving the previously unaddressed case of phase waves and their stability properties.

Method: Combines geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and Riccati transform to analyze Bloch-wave eigenfunctions and track decay of modulations through fold points.

Result: Reveals remarkably weak interaction strength of order ε^{8/3} for phase waves, shows diffusive synchronization in FitzHugh-Nagumo system, and identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities realized in a system variant.

Conclusion: The analysis provides new insights into synchronization mechanisms of relaxation oscillations, demonstrating both stable diffusive synchronization and potential instability patterns in reaction-diffusion systems.

Abstract: We analyze synchronization of relaxation oscillations in multiple-timescale reaction-diffusion systems. Interpreting synchronization as convergence to frequency-synchronized wave-train solutions, we resolve for the first time the case of phase waves. These waves are nearly phase-synchronized relaxation oscillations, featuring quasistationary plateaus of length $\varepsilon^{-1}$ separated by fast transition layers, where $\varepsilon\ll1$ is the timescale separation parameter. Tracking the decay of modulations via a Bloch-wave eigenfunction analysis, we find a remarkably weak interaction strength of order $\varepsilon^{8/3}$. This weak layer interaction and many of the technical difficulties arise from repeated scattering of eigenfunctions through fold points at the ends of the quasistationary plateaus. We capture this by combining a novel geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and the Riccati transform. While our spectral stability analysis yields diffusive synchronization of all phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, it also identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities, which we realize in a system variant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing kinetic models lack mechanical cell-substrate interactions essential for explaining observed collective behaviors in biological systems like bacterial colonies.

Method: Introduces acceleration term in kinetic equation to capture mechanotaxis dynamics, derives macroscopic limit equations, analyzes linear stability and pattern formation theoretically and numerically.

Result: Developed new kinetic framework for mechanotaxis-driven migration, derived family of macroscopic equations, demonstrated pattern formation capabilities through stability analysis and simulations.

Conclusion: Mechanical interactions with substrate are crucial for collective cell behaviors; new model provides foundation for studying mechanotaxis-driven pattern formation in biological systems.

Abstract: We present a new kinetic equation for cell migration driven by mechanical interactions with the substrate, an effect not previously captured in kinetic models, and essential for explaining observed collective behaviors such as those in bacterial colonies. The model introduces an acceleration term that accounts for the dynamics of motile cells undergoing mechanotaxis, where extracellular signals modulate the forces arising from cell-substrate interactions. From this formulation, we derive a family of macroscopic limit equations and analyze their principal properties. In particular, we examine linear stability and pattern formation ability through theoretical analysis, supported by numerical simulations.

Motivation: To develop a general framework for analyzing entire solutions to nonlinear PDEs, addressing both existence and nonexistence questions in a unified manner, particularly for Hessian-type equations.

Method: Investigates Cauchy problems on positive half-line using a unified approach that handles both local and entire solvability, applied to k-Hessian type equations and new P-k-Hessian type equations, extended to p-Hessian matrices with p>1 and degenerate non-homogeneous terms.

Result: Provides existence and nonexistence results for entire solutions, establishes sharp local and entire solvability for nonlinear PDEs, and demonstrates applications to two series of equations: k-Hessian type and new P-k-Hessian type equations.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing entire solutions to nonlinear PDEs, with applications to Hessian-type equations, offering tools for both existence proofs and nonexistence demonstrations in a unified approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of entire solutions to a general class of Cauchy problems in the positive half line. Our results provide a unified approach to proving sharp local and entire solvability of nonlinear partial differential equations in n-dimensional Euclidean space. As applications of the general framework, we present such results for two series of nonlinear equations: a series of k-Hessian type equations and a new series of P-k-Hessian type equations. These results are also proved for the more general p-Hessian matrices, with p > 1, and degenerate non homogeneous terms.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper revisits Dahlberg's inequalities relating L² norms of harmonic functions on boundaries to weighted gradient integrals, shows they fail for polygonal domains, identifies a new functional space with better trace properties, and proves the inequalities hold for smooth C¹,¹ domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the validity of Dahlberg's inequalities for harmonic functions vanishing at a point, and to complete the solvability of the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem in fractional Sobolev spaces for polygonal/polyhedral domains.

Method: Uses Grisvard's work and interpolation theory for subspaces to analyze the Dirichlet problem in fractional Sobolev spaces H^s(Ω). Constructs explicit counterexamples using Nečas functions to show Dahlberg's inequalities fail for polygonal domains. Identifies a new functional space E(∇;Ω) with specific embedding properties.

Result: Shows Dahlberg's inequalities are invalid for polygonal/polyhedral domains in their original form. Identifies a functional space E(∇;Ω) with H^{1/2}_{00}(Ω)↪E(∇;Ω)↪H^{1/2}(Ω) where the trace operator is well-defined and continuous. Proves the inequalities hold for C¹,¹ domains.

Conclusion: Dahlberg's inequalities depend on domain regularity - they fail for polygonal domains but hold for smooth C¹,¹ domains. The new functional space E(∇;Ω) provides an alternative characterization for functions with L² traces and gives a new characterization of H^{1/2}_{00}(Ω).

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the following estimate due to Dahlberg \cite{Dahl}. Let $\textit{\textbf x}_0$ a fixed point in a bounded Lipschitz domain $Ω$. Then there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that if $u$ is a harmonic function in $Ω$ and vanishes at $\textit{\textbf x}_0$, then \begin{equation*} C^{-1} \Vert u \Vert_{L^2(Γ)} \leq \Big(\int_Ω\varrho\vert \nabla u \vert^2\Big)^{1/2} \leq C \Vert u \Vert_{L^2(Γ)}, \end{equation*} where $\varrho$ is the distance to the boundary of $Ω$. Using Grisvard's work and interpolation theory for subspaces, we complete the solvability of the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem: $$ (\mathscr{L}_D^0)\ \ \ \ -Δu = f\quad \ \mbox{in}\ Ω\quad \mbox{and } \quad u = 0 \ \ \mbox{on }Γ, $$ in a framework of fractional Sobolev spaces $H^s(Ω)$, when $Ω$ is a polygon or a polyhedron domain and $1/2 \leq s \leq 2$. Thanks to these regularity results and an explicit function given by Ne$\mathrm{\check{c}}$as, we show that the above inequalities cannot be valid in their current form. On the other hand, we identify a functional space which satisfies the embeddings $H^{1/2}_{00}(Ω)\hookrightarrow E(\nabla;\, Ω) \hookrightarrow H^{1/2}(Ω)$ and the trace operator $γ_0$ from $E(\nabla;\, Ω)$ into $L^2(Γ)$ is well-defined and continuous. This leads to an alternative to the functions $H^{1/2}(Ω)$, non necessarily harmonic, for having a trace in $L^2(Γ)$ and also to a new characterization of $H^{1/2}_{00}(Ω)$ as the kernel of this operator. However, we show that if the domain $Ω$ is of class $\mathscr{C}^{1, 1}$, then the above inequalities are valid.

*Jessica Slegers*

TL;DR: This monograph explores Harnack inequalities for nonlinear evolution equations, focusing on extending Li-Yau methods to porous medium and p-diffusion equations, with applications to Hölder continuity proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harnack inequalities are powerful qualitative tools for understanding PDE properties, originally for harmonic functions but now extended to broader classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. The motivation is to develop Harnack inequalities for nonlinear evolution equations by building on established linear theory.

Method: The approach builds on methods introduced by Li and Yau for the linear heat equation, extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. The work includes studying a minimization problem that naturally appears in proofs, establishing three general Harnack inequality results, and applying Moser's methods for proving Hölder continuity.

Result: The monograph establishes Harnack inequalities for solutions of porous medium equation and weak solutions of p-diffusion equation (parabolic p-Laplace operator). It also demonstrates local space-time Hölder continuity for a class of linear evolution problems using Moser's methods.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends Harnack inequality theory to nonlinear evolution equations, providing concrete applications to porous medium and p-diffusion equations, while also showing how these inequalities can be used to prove regularity properties like Hölder continuity. Future research opportunities are identified.

Abstract: Harnack inequalities are useful qualitative tools for understanding the properties of partial differential equations. Originally discovered as a property of harmonic functions, Harnack inequalities have since been studied for solutions of wider classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. In this monograph, we take particular interest in deriving Harnack inequalities for solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation. Finally, we demonstrate a common application of Harnack inequalities by proving the local space-time Hölder continuity of solutions to a class of linear evolution problems. The proof is based on methods introduced by Moser during his seminal work on Harnack inequalities during the 1960s. We conclude by suggesting potential opportunities for future work following on from the topics discussed here.

*Farid Bozorgnia*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Two different singularly perturbed elliptic systems for phase segregation have identical free boundaries in the limit, despite different formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether different mathematical formulations of phase segregation models lead to the same interface geometry in the singular limit.

Method: Compare two fundamentally different singularly perturbed elliptic systems, prove their limiting configurations share identical free boundaries, and conduct numerical experiments.

Result: The limiting free boundaries are identical for both systems, showing interface geometry depends only on basic structural properties, harmonicity in positivity sets, and boundary data, not on the specific formulation.

Conclusion: Interface geometry in phase segregation is determined by fundamental structural properties rather than specific model formulations, with numerical confirmation supporting the theoretical findings.

Abstract: We compare two singularly perturbed elliptic systems modeling partially phase segregation. Although the formulations are fundamentally different, we prove that their limiting configurations have identical free boundaries. The result shows that interface geometry depends only on basic structural properties of the limit segregation, harmonicity in positivity sets, and boundary data, while the limiting solution values may differ. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes local boundedness and Harnack inequalities for nonnegative solutions of elliptic PDEs with symmetric coefficient fields under coarse-grained ellipticity conditions, extending beyond classical integrability assumptions to include degenerate/singular fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Harnack inequality results to more general coefficient fields beyond classical integrability conditions, including degenerate and singular fields that appear in applications like fractal measures and Gaussian multiplicative chaos.

Method: Introduces coarse-grained ellipticity as a scale-dependent condition defined via effective diffusion matrices on triadic cubes. Shows this condition can be enforced by negative Sobolev regularity hypotheses, and proves quantitative Harnack inequalities depending on coarse-grained ellipticity ratios.

Result: Proves local boundedness and quantitative Harnack inequalities under coarse-grained ellipticity. Recovers Trudinger's classical result as a special case, obtains sharp scaling of Harnack constants, and applies to new classes of degenerate/singular coefficient fields beyond previous approaches.

Conclusion: The coarse-grained ellipticity framework provides a more flexible approach to establishing Harnack inequalities, extending beyond classical integrability assumptions to include coefficient fields with only L¹ integrability but negative Sobolev regularity, covering important applications in analysis of degenerate/singular media.

Abstract: We prove local boundedness and a Harnack inequality for nonnegative weak solutions of the equation $-\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{a}(x)\nabla u)=0$ under a coarse-grained ellipticity assumption on the symmetric coefficient field $\mathbf{a}$. Coarse-grained ellipticity is a scale-dependent condition, defined for fields with only $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^1$, in terms of families of effective diffusion matrices on triadic cubes of all sizes, and our estimates depend quantitatively on a corresponding coarse-grained ellipticity ratio. We show that coarse-grained ellipticity can be enforced by purely negative Sobolev regularity hypotheses: if $\mathbf{a}\in L^1\cap W^{-s,p}(U)$ and $\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^1\cap W^{-t,q}(U)$ for exponents $p,q\in[1,\infty]$ and $s,t\in[0,1)$ satisfying $s<1-\frac{1}{p}$, $t<1-\frac{1}{q}$ and \[ \frac{s+t}{2} + \frac{d}{2}\Bigl(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}\Bigr) < 1, \] then $\mathbf{a}$ is coarse-grained elliptic in $U$ and every nonnegative solution satisfies a quantitative unit-scale Harnack inequality. In particular, when $s=t=0$ we recover Trudinger's classical result under the integrability condition $\mathbf{a}\in L^p$, $\mathbf{a}^{-1}\in L^q$ with $\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}<\frac{2}{d}$, and we obtain the sharp scaling of the Harnack constant in terms of $\|\mathbf{a}\|_{L^p}$ and $\|\mathbf{a}^{-1}\|_{L^q}$. More importantly, our criteria apply to new classes of degenerate and singular coefficient fields for which $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a}^{-1}\notin L^{1+δ}$ for all $δ>0$, including examples generated by singular fractal measures and Gaussian multiplicative chaos, beyond the reach of previous approaches based solely on integrability assumptions.

TL;DR: Existence of nontrivial n-harmonic maps from spheres to manifolds with nontrivial higher homotopy groups, obtained as bubbling limits of p-harmonic maps as p approaches n from above.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish existence results for n-harmonic maps from spheres to closed manifolds when higher homotopy groups are nontrivial, connecting p-harmonic map theory to n-harmonic maps through limiting processes.

Method: Using min-max constructions for p-harmonic maps with p > n, then taking the limit as p → n⁺ to obtain bubbling limits that become nontrivial n-harmonic maps.

Result: Proved existence of nontrivial n-harmonic maps from 𝕊ⁿ to 𝒩 when π_{n+k}(𝒩) ≠ {0} for some k ≥ 0, with k ≥ 1 cases appearing as bubbling limits of p-harmonic maps.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a connection between p-harmonic maps and n-harmonic maps through limiting processes, providing existence results for nontrivial n-harmonic maps from spheres to manifolds with nontrivial higher homotopy groups.

Abstract: For any $n \geq 3$ and any closed manifold $\mathcal{N}$ with $π_{n+k}(\mathcal{N}) \neq \{0\}$ for some $k \geq 0$, we establish the existence of nontrivial $n$-harmonic maps from $\mathbb{S}^n$ into $\mathcal{N}$. When $k\geq 1$, these maps naturally appear as bubbling limits of $p$-harmonic maps with $p > n$, obtained by min-max constructions in the limit $p \to n^+$.

### [20] [Stability and dynamics of planar fronts in reaction-diffusion systems under nonlocalized perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05832)
*Björn de Rijk,Joris van Winden*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes Lyapunov stability for bistable planar fronts in multicomponent reaction-diffusion systems on ℝ^d against nonlocalized perturbations, showing leading-order dynamics governed by viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations, with asymptotic orbital stability generally not holding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work could only treat nonlocalized perturbations for scalar equations using comparison principles. The analysis of nonlocalized perturbations on ℝ^d poses significant challenges at both linear and nonlinear levels due to continuous spectrum touching the origin and critical decay rates of quadratic gradient terms.

Method: Careful decomposition of linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with stability analysis techniques from viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme combining spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform.

Result: Established Lyapunov stability of bistable planar fronts against fully nonlocalized perturbations, proved leading-order dynamics governed by viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations, showed asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general, but can be recovered with transverse localization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends stability analysis to multicomponent systems with nonlocalized perturbations, overcoming significant linear and nonlinear challenges through innovative methods, revealing fundamental limitations on asymptotic orbital stability while providing effective descriptions of front dynamics.

Abstract: We analyze the stability and dynamics of bistable planar fronts in multicomponent reaction-diffusion systems on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform.

*Vikram Giri,Hyunju Kwon,Matthew Novack*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper defines generalized helicity for low-regularity Euler solutions and constructs weak solutions with prescribed helicity and energy at near-critical regularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: For smooth solutions of 3D Euler equations, helicity is conserved, but for low-regularity weak solutions, helicity definition and conservation are unclear. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Define generalized helicity extending classical definitions, then construct weak solutions of Euler equations with almost Onsager-critical regularity in L^3 space.

Result: Successfully construct weak solutions with prescribed generalized helicity and kinetic energy at near-critical regularity levels.

Conclusion: The work establishes a framework for helicity in low-regularity settings and demonstrates existence of weak solutions with controlled helicity and energy properties.

Abstract: For a $C^1_{t,x}$ solution $u$ to the incompressible 3D Euler equations, the helicity $H(u(t))=\int_{\mathbb{T}^3} u \cdot \textrm{curl}\, u$ is constant in time. For general low-regularity weak solutions, it is not always clear how to define the helicity, or whether it must be constant in time in the case that there is a clear definition. In this paper, we define a generalized helicity which extends the classical definitions and construct weak solutions of Euler of almost Onsager-critical regularity in $L^3$ with prescribed generalized helicity and kinetic energy.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: New variational methods using profile decomposition prove existence of ground state solutions for semilinear elliptic equations with critical Sobolev growth in asymptotically periodic settings, handling general nonlinearities without Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition or monotonicity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop variational methods that can handle semilinear elliptic equations with critical Sobolev growth in asymptotically periodic frameworks, overcoming limitations of classical assumptions like the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and specific decay rates for coefficients.

Method: Introduces new variational methods based on direct application of profile decomposition theorem for bounded sequences in Sobolev spaces. Uses these methods to prove existence of ground state solutions for equations with critical Sobolev growth in asymptotically periodic settings.

Result: Proves existence of ground state solutions under two alternative conditions: either a strict energy gap between minimax levels of original and asymptotic problems, or direct energy comparison between associated functionals. Handles highly general nonlinearities including subcritical terms without Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and critical terms with oscillatory behavior.

Conclusion: The new variational methods based on profile decomposition provide a powerful framework for proving existence of ground states in asymptotically periodic critical problems, eliminating need for restrictive assumptions like specific decay rates or monotonicity properties.

Abstract: This paper introduces new variational methods centered on the direct application of a profile decomposition theorem for bounded sequences in Sobolev spaces. We employ these methods to prove the existence of ground state solutions for a class of semilinear elliptic equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with critical Sobolev growth, set in an asymptotically periodic framework where the coefficients converge to periodic functions at infinity. Our approach successfully addresses highly general nonlinearities, including a subcritical term that does not need to satisfy the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and a critical term that extends far beyond the standard pure power assumption to include functions with oscillatory behavior. We prove the existence of ground states under two alternative conditions: either a strict energy gap between the minimax levels of the original and asymptotic problems or a direct energy comparison between the associated functionals. Some restrictive assumptions, such as specific decay rates for the coefficients or monotonicity properties of the nonlinearities, are not required in our results.

*Alexander Wieczorek,Nathan Rodkey,Jan Sommerhäuser,Jason Hattrick-Simpers,Sebastian Siol*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Autonomous Bayesian optimization and SHAP analysis of bipolar HiPIMS pulsing schemes reveals minimal deposition rate improvements despite complex parameter exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPIMS offers superior coating control but suffers from low deposition rates compared to conventional sputtering. Complex bipolar pulsing schemes could potentially improve rates, but their high-dimensional parameter spaces are too complex for traditional experimental design.

Method: Used autonomous Bayesian sampling over 6-dimensional parameter space (3000+ conditions) for bipolar HiPIMS pulses on Al and Ti targets. Applied SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to interpret complex process influences on deposition rates and link variations to physical mechanisms like back-attraction and plasma ignition.

Result: Only minimal improvements in deposition rate were achieved. Positive pulse components placed immediately after negative pulses were generally detrimental, likely due to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The workflow successfully identified physical mechanisms but didn't yield significant rate improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed autonomous experimentation + interpretable ML workflow is broadly applicable for complex plasma process optimization, enabling physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies despite limited success in this specific case.

Abstract: High-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) offers considerable control over ion energy and flux, making it invaluable for tailoring the microstructure and properties of advanced functional coatings. However, compared to conventional sputtering techniques, HiPIMS suffers from reduced deposition rates. Many groups have begun to evaluate complex pulsing schemes to improve upon this, leveraging multi-pulse schemes (e.g. pre-ionization or bipolar pulses). Unfortunately, the increased complexity of these pulsing schemes has led to high-dimensionality parameter spaces that are prohibitive to classic design of experi-ments. In this work we evaluate bipolar HiPIMS pulses for improving deposition rates of Al and Ti sputter tar-gets. Over 3000 process conditions were collected via autonomous Bayesian sampling over a 6-dimensional parameter space. These process conditions were then interpreted using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to deconvolute complex process influences on deposition rates. This allows us to link observed var-iations in deposition rate to physical mechanisms such as back-attraction and plasma ignition. Insights gained from this approach were then used to target specific processes where the positive pulse components were expected to have the highest impact on deposition rates. However, in practice, only minimal improve-ments in deposition rate were achieved. In most cases, the positive pulse appears to be detrimental when placed immediately after the neg. pulse which we hypothesize relates to quenching of the afterglow plasma. The proposed workflow combining autonomous experimentation and interpretable machine learning is broad-ly applicable to the discovery and optimization of complex plasma processes, paving the way for physics-informed, data-driven advancements in coating technologies.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using nano-antennas for fusion to enable simultaneous ignition throughout the target volume, avoiding mechanical instabilities and slow burning spread issues in current laser fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current laser-induced fusion methods rely on extreme mechanical shock compression that creates only one hotspot, leading to slow burning spread and potential mechanical instabilities. The authors argue that present approaches are based on a mistaken assumption about detonation normal vectors that eliminates the possibility of rapid, radiation-dominated detonations.

Method: The proposed method uses nano-antennas in radiation-dominated systems to achieve simultaneous ignition throughout the entire target volume. Protons are accelerated in the direction of the nano-antennas, which are orthogonal to the laser irradiation direction, enabling rapid ignition without time for mechanical instabilities to develop.

Result: The approach enables simultaneous ignition across the whole target volume rather than just one hotspot, eliminating the slow burning spread problem and preventing mechanical instabilities from developing due to the rapid ignition process.

Conclusion: Nano-antennas offer a superior approach to laser fusion by enabling radiation-dominated, simultaneous ignition throughout the target, overcoming limitations of current mechanical compression methods and their associated instabilities.

Abstract: Why do we use nano-antennas for fusion? In three sentences: The present laser induced fusion plans use extreme mechanical shock compression to get one hotspot and then ignition. Still fusion burning spreads slower than expansion, and mechanical instabilities may also develop. With nano-antennas in radiation dominated systems, simultaneous ignition can be achieved in the whole target volume and there is no time left for mechanical instabilities. Ignition is achieved with protons accelerated in the direction of the nanoantennas that are orthogonal to the direction of laser irradiation.
  Present laser fusion methods are based on extreme and slow mechanical compression with an ablator surface on the fuel target pellet to increase compression and eliminate penetration of laser electromagnetic energy into the target. This arises from a mistaken assumption, [1] that the detonation normal 4-vector should have vanishing time-like component, and this assumption eliminates the possibility to rapid or even simultaneous, radiation dominated detonations, (which are well known in the burning (or hadronization) of Quark Gluon Plasma).

TL;DR: BISER is a bright, coherent XUV/x-ray source from relativistic plasma singularities driven by multi-terawatt lasers, with nanometer source size, quadratic power scaling, water-window spectra, attosecond pulse durations, and potential brightness exceeding XFELs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an extremely bright, coherent XUV and x-ray source using compact multi-terawatt lasers that can potentially exceed the brightness of free electron lasers, with applications spanning from attosecond science to potential gravitational wave generation.

Method: Uses relativistic plasma singularities driven by multi-terawatt femtosecond lasers in gas targets, with emission originating from nanometer-scale sources. The approach combines experimental discovery, relativistic laser plasma simulations, catastrophe theory, and theoretical modeling validation.

Result: BISER produces bright coherent XUV/x-rays with hundreds of eV bandwidth covering the water window region, quadratic yield scaling with laser power, nanometer source size, near-transform-limited pulses potentially shorter than 24 attoseconds, and predicted brightness exceeding XFELs at petawatt laser powers.

Conclusion: BISER establishes a new framework for coherent radiation generation from traveling wave media, offering wavelength scalability, terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation potential, and applications beyond x-rays including gravitational waves.

Abstract: Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation (BISER) appears as a bright temporally and spatially coherent Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray source driven by compact multi-terawatt femtosecond lasers in gas targets. There BISER originates from relativistic plasma singularities, so that the emission source size has a nanometer scale. The BISER x-ray yield quadratically depends on the driving laser power. BISER spectra have hundreds of electronvolt (eV) bandwidth embracing the 'water window' region (284 - 543 eV). Simulations predict that BISER pulses have durations close to the transform limit, which promises pulses shorter than the atomic unit of time (24 attoseconds). Based on the BISER brightness at ~20 terawatt laser power and the quadratic scaling, the brightness of BISER driven by petawatt-class lasers is predicted to exceed XUV free electron lasers. The BISER concept creates a new framework for a wide range of media emitting travelling waves capable of constructive interference, including gravitational waves. Here we review the BISER experimental discovery, its explanation based on the relativistic laser plasma simulations and catastrophe theory, experimental validation of the theoretical BISER model, proposal for imaging fast moving singularities, driving laser requirements, and future prospects emphasizing the driving laser wavelength scalability and possibility of terawatt attosecond coherent x-ray pulse generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand vorticity evolution in relativistic collisionless plasmas and identify differences from non-relativistic theory, particularly regarding the frozen-in condition of canonical vorticity.

Method: Reformulate relativistic momentum equation to describe canonical vorticity evolution, identify new source term (kineclinic term), and verify through particle-in-cell simulations of modified Beltrami flow.

Result: Discovered an additional source term for canonical vorticity that embodies misalignment between fluid momentum and velocity gradients. This kineclinic term breaks frozen-in condition, enabling magnetic field and vorticity generation/dissipation. Simulations confirm the effect.

Conclusion: Kineclinicity is finite in all relativistic plasma systems due to lack of functional relationship between fluid momentum and velocity, fundamentally altering vorticity dynamics compared to non-relativistic plasmas.

Abstract: The relativistic momentum equation of a collisionless plasma is reformulated to describe the time evolution of canonical vorticity. Compared to the non-relativistic counterpart, an additional source term for canonical vorticity is identified, which embodies the misalignment between the fluid momentum and fluid velocity gradients. This kineclinic term breaks the frozen-in condition of canonical vorticity, thereby enabling generation or dissipation of magnetic fields and vorticity. We verify the role of this effect through particle-in-cell simulations of a modified Beltrami flow. Kineclinicity should be finite for all relativistic plasma systems due to the general lack of a functional relationship between fluid momentum and fluid velocity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively characterize the electric field evolution during the inception phase and transition to streamer formation in nanosecond positive corona discharges, which is challenging to measure directly.

Method: Integrated time-resolved E-FISH measurements with machine-learning-assisted field inversion (operator-learning model) and iCCD optical emission imaging, averaging over many axisymmetric discharge events for nanosecond-resolution reconstruction.

Result: Reconstructed electric field shows rapid increase in first nanoseconds, formation of shell-like structure with peak reduced fields of 230-270 Td (±20-30% uncertainty), corresponding to regime where electron-impact excitation and photoionization become efficient, consistent with transition from stable inception to streamer destabilization.

Conclusion: The methodology establishes reliable quantitative E-field mapping for discharge inception phase and identifies conditions where inversion is applicable (before streamer branching introduces asymmetry), providing framework for extending diagnostics to early stages of nanosecond atmospheric discharges.

Abstract: This study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution of the electric field during the early stages of a nanosecond positive corona discharge in atmospheric-pressure air by combining time-resolved E-FISH measurements, machine-learning-assisted field inversion (based on a recently developed operator-learning model), and iCCD optical emission imaging. The objective is to quantitatively characterize the electric field in the vicinity of the high-voltage electrode during inception and the transition toward streamer formation. By averaging over a large number of discharge events and operating in a regime where the discharge remains statistically axisymmetric, the proposed approach enables reconstruction of the electric-field profiles with nanosecond resolution. The results show a rapid increase of the field during the first nanoseconds, followed by the formation of a shell-like structure exhibiting the highest reduced fields prior to destabilization. The reconstructed reduced electric-field magnitude reaches peak values in the range of approximately 230-270 Td, with an estimated uncertainty of about 20-30% associated with calibration and profile-shape effects. These values correspond to the regime where electron-impact excitation and photoionization processes become highly efficient, consistent with the observed transition from a stable inception cloud to streamer destabilization. After the onset of streamer branching, increasing asymmetry limits the applicability of the inversion, and the reconstructed fields represent averaged contributions rather than the local field at individual streamer heads. The methodology thus identifies the conditions under which quantitative E-field mapping is reliable and establishes a framework for extending electric-field diagnostics to the inception phase of nanosecond atmospheric discharges.

TL;DR: Study of energetic particles (EPs) stabilizing ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes using ORB5 code, extending to broader EP temperatures including burning plasma regime and different EP distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand EP-ITG interactions across wider EP parameter ranges relevant to burning plasma regimes (like ITER), which is crucial for predicting turbulence and confinement in future fusion devices.

Method: Used global particle in cell ORB5 code to study EP-ITG interactions, extending previous studies to broader EP temperatures (including burning plasma regime T_f > 50T_i) and various EP distribution functions (including slowing-down distributions).

Result: Two main stabilization mechanisms identified: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective at intermediate EP temperatures, and dilution effect (DE) independent of EP temperature and dominant in burning plasma regime. Slowing-down distributions show no DDRM-related stabilization. In ITER scenario, EP stabilization weaker than β-stabilization.

Conclusion: Results provide improved understanding of EP-ITG interactions across wider EP parameter ranges relevant to burning plasmas, important for predicting turbulence and confinement in future fusion devices like ITER.

Abstract: The interaction between energetic particles (EPs) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes is studied using the global particle in cell ORB5 code. In this work, we extend previous studies to a broader range of EP temperatures, including the burning plasma regime and to wider variety of EP distribution functions. Two main stabilization mechanisms are found to be effective in ITG stabilization confirming previous studies: direct dispersion relation modification (DDRM) effective only at intermediate EP temperatures and dilution effect (DE) which is independent of EP temperature and becomes dominant in burning plasma regime ($T_f > 50T_i$). The study is further extended to slowing-down EP distributions which in contrast exhibit no DDRM-related stabilization. The findings are further validated in an ITER pre-fusion operation scenario and additionally compared with electromagnetic effects. In this scenario EP stabilization is found to be weaker than $β$-stabilization. Overall, these results provide better understanding of EP-ITG interactions over a wider range of EP parameters relevant to burning plasma regime which is important for predicting turbulence and confinement in future devices such as ITER.

Conclusion: Fitzpatrick's paper contains fundamental physics errors and misrepresents the author's work, requiring urgent public correction to maintain scientific integrity and support ongoing research.

Abstract: The article Nuclear Fusion \textbf{66}, 016012 (2026) by Richard Fitzpatrick is based on fundamental errors in the physics of the poloidal magnetic flux in tokamaks. His paper was inspired by an article that I posted on arXiv in various versions [arXiv:2507.05456]. The September 9, 2025 version was submitted to the Physics of Plasmas, which flatly rejected the article. Before I can resubmit, the Physics of Plasmas stated that the issues with the Fitzpatrick article must be explained. Not only did Fitzpatrick make numerous fundamental errors in science, he totally misrepresented my views as clearly stated in my article and even more explicitly in email exchanges, called ``private communication" in his paper. Enquiries were made to the journal Nuclear Fusion staring on November 24, 2025 of the consistency of Fitzpatrick's article with the scientific and ethical standards of the journal. On January 5, 2026, Nuclear Fusion said they had "no evidence of intentional misrepresentation," but others may disagree after reading the emails. Both grants and the publication of an important paper make the public availability of this Comment urgent.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Global existence of probabilistically weak solutions for stochastic phase-field models with singular diffusion, used in modeling single-cell chemotaxis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study existence of solutions for stochastic phase-field models that describe moving boundary problems, particularly relevant for modeling single-cell chemotaxis where cell shape contours correspond to phase-field level sets.

Method: Analyze stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with singular diffusion forced by a phase-field, considering both independently evolving phase-fields and coupled evolution via viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Address technical challenges of singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field.

Result: Establish global existence of probabilistically weak solutions in L²-spaces with weights that compensate for the singularities, for large classes of initial data.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates existence of solutions for challenging stochastic phase-field models with singularities, providing mathematical foundation for applications in biological modeling of chemotaxis.

Abstract: We study existence of solutions in the variational sense for a class of stochastic phase-field models describing moving boundary problems. The models consist of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with singular diffusion forced by a phase-field. We investigate both the case of an independently evolving phase-field and of coupled phase-field evolution driven by a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Such systems are used in the modelling of single-cell chemotaxis, where the contour of the cell shape corresponds to a level set of the phase-field. The technical challenge lies in the singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field. For large classes of initial data, we establish global existence of probabilistically weak solutions in $L^2$-spaces with weights which compensate for the singularities.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper proves that driven diffusive systems modeled by the Stochastic Burgers Equation with general nonlinearity converge to an explicit Gaussian fixed point under logarithmically superdiffusive scaling, extending previous results to critical dimension and beyond weak coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously justify and correct classical physics derivations of the Stochastic Burgers Equation based on Spohn's nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory, and to establish the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems at critical dimension.

Method: Study the Stochastic Burgers Equation with general nonlinearity at critical dimension in infinite volume, using logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, deriving fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator and developing new approximations for the resolvent associated with the quadratic SBE solution.

Result: The large-scale behavior converges to the same explicit Gaussian fixed point as in previous work on quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalized coefficients, validating and correcting the classical physics derivation from 1986.

Conclusion: This represents the first universality result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of Hairer-Quastel's work to critical dimension and beyond weak coupling, overcoming challenges from mild growth conditions on nonlinearity.

Abstract: We study the large-scale behaviour of a class of driven diffusive systems modelled by a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation, the Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) with general nonlinearity, at the critical dimension and in infinite volume. Our main result shows that, under a logarithmically superdiffusive space-time scaling, it is given by the same explicit Gaussian Fixed point obtained in [G. Cannizzaro, Q. Moulard, & F. Toninelli, arxiv.org/abs/2501.00344, 2025] for the quadratic SBE, but with suitably renormalised coefficients, thereby rigorously justifying and partly correcting the classical Physics derivation of the SBE in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, & H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] based on Spohn's theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics. Besides, ours is the first universality-type result for out-of-equilibrium systems and the first extension of [M. Hairer, J. Quastel, Forum of Mathematics, Pi, Vol. 6, 2018, e3], to the critical dimension and beyond weak coupling. The major challenge in our work is the mild growth condition on the nonlinearity which renders even the well-posedness of the microscopic equation non-trivial. Additional key novelties include the derivation of fine estimates on the non-quadratic part of the generator as well as a new approximation for the resolvent associated to the solution of the quadratic SBE.

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: Strong well-posedness for stochastic 2D Euler and generalized SQG equations with L^p initial data and rough transport noise, extending previous results to cover all α∈(0,1) including physically relevant α=2/3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works only addressed the problem with noise of spatial regularity α∈(0,1/2), where rougher noise yields stronger regularization. The authors aim to remove this limitation by allowing any α∈(0,1), covering the same range where anomalous regularization effects occur in passive scalars, including the physically relevant case α=2/3 associated with Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling.

Method: The authors prove strong well-posedness results for stochastic 2D Euler equations in vorticity form and generalized SQG equations. The equations are driven by spatially rough, incompressible transport noise of Kraichnan type, with L^p initial data. The method extends beyond previous limitations on noise regularity.

Result: The paper establishes strong well-posedness for these equations with noise of any regularity α∈(0,1), covering the full range where anomalous regularization effects are known to occur. This includes the physically relevant case α=2/3 associated with Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade.

Conclusion: The authors successfully remove previous limitations on noise regularity, extending the theory to cover all α∈(0,1) including physically relevant cases. This bridges the gap between mathematical theory and physical applications, particularly for turbulence modeling where α=2/3 corresponds to Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling.

Abstract: We prove strong well-posedness results for the stochastic 2D Euler equations in vorticity form and generalized SQG equations, with $L^p$ initial data and driven by a spatially rough, incompressible transport noise of Kraichnan type. Previous works addressed this problem with noise of spatial regularity $α\in (0,1/2)$, in a setting where a rougher noise yields a stronger regularization. We remove this limitation by allowing any $α\in (0,1)$, covering the same range of parameters for which anomalous regularization effects are known to occur in passive scalars. In particular, this covers the physically relevant case $α=2/3$, associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov scaling of energy cascade.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators as a unified framework that generalizes fractional calculus beyond power-law memory constraints, enabling modeling of multi-scale memory effects and aging in heterogeneous media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fractional calculus with power-law memory is insufficient for modeling complex phenomena in heterogeneous media that exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties, which classical operators cannot capture.

Method: Construct Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators that generalize fractional calculus by freeing it from power-law memory constraints (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration).

Result: Proved Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem showing Weighted Fourier Transform diagonalizes these operators; characterized admissible memory kernels via Complete Bernstein Functions; established bridge between algebraic Sonine definition and analytical Marchaud representation; applied theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and Weighted Distributed Order evolution problems.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully models ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging phenomena within a spectral framework, providing a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus for complex heterogeneous media.

Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration).
  The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving Lévy measures.
  Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning framework that promotes integration constants of asymptotic solutions to scale-dependent functions, enabling smooth interpolation between regimes without manual boundary matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patching methods for solving complex differential equations with scale-dependent terms often fail because approximate solutions break down near matching boundaries, requiring arbitrary boundary matching procedures.

Method: Promote integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions to scale-dependent functions, then constrain these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the entire domain using a learning framework.

Result: The framework successfully reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology.

Conclusion: The proposed learning approach eliminates the need for arbitrary boundary matching by learning globally valid solutions that smoothly interpolate between asymptotic regimes, offering a more robust alternative to traditional patching methods.

Abstract: In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning of JKO solution operator for efficient Wasserstein gradient flow computation without solving JKO subproblems numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The JKO scheme is computationally expensive due to repeatedly solving JKO subproblems, limiting its practical use despite providing a stable variational framework for Wasserstein gradient flows.

Method: Proposes Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns JKO operator and its induced trajectories through alternating trajectory generation and operator updates, using self-supervised learning without numerical JKO solutions.

Result: Numerical experiments show the method achieves accuracy, stability, and robustness across various energies and initial conditions, with generated data approximating true JKO trajectories as training progresses.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient computation of Wasserstein gradient flows by learning JKO solution operators, overcoming computational limitations through self-supervised learning and data augmentation via the Learn-to-Evolve strategy.

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation through thermodynamic lens, showing its positive spectra prevent metriplectic description. A thermodynamic variant is created that generates entropy but only has constant equilibria. Numerical experiments reconcile KS entropy generation with its energy source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the differences between driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the second law of thermodynamics, and to understand why the KS equation cannot be described by metriplectic dynamics despite being a dissipative system.

Method: Analyzed a general velocity and entropy density system using metriplectic dynamics framework. Created a thermodynamic variant of the KS equation that monotonically generates entropy. Performed numerical experiments comparing the original KS equation with its thermodynamic variant, and conducted further experiments restricting positive spectra in KS equation.

Result: Positive spectra of KS equation due to external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. The thermodynamic variant generates entropy but only has spatially constant equilibria. Driving effects of KS equation further increase entropy of thermodynamic system. Restricting positive spectra shows: rescaling growth rates produces similar behavior on slower time scale; introducing individual positive spectra leads to formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and transition to chaos.

Conclusion: The paper reconciles entropy generation in KS equation with its external energy source, showing how driving effects increase entropy. While KS equation cannot be described by metriplectic dynamics due to positive spectra, restricting these spectra reveals different dynamical regimes including equilibria and chaos transitions.

Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.

*F. Zhang,J. Martínez-Sykora,Q. M. Wargnier,V. H. Hansteen*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that simultaneously satisfies ionization and hydrostatic equilibrium to avoid non-physical disturbances in solar atmospheric models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The solar atmosphere has varying ionization states across different layers, but integrating ionization/recombination processes into multi-fluid models with gravitational stratification is challenging. Initial in-equilibria can cause non-physical disturbances and numerical instability.

Method: Assume collisional coupling between fluids without high-frequency external driving. Calculate ionization fractions from statistical equilibrium at given temperatures or extract from existing atmospheric models. Use a numerical integration routine to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications.

Result: The routine successfully constructs gravitational stratifications in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given multi-species ionization fractions. Fluid decoupling appears in the transition region without dynamic driving, while total velocity remains zero.

Conclusion: The constructed stratification can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.

Abstract: Context. The solar atmosphere is gravitationally stratified and consists of several layers at temperatures different by orders of magnitude. Consequently, the solar atmospheric plasma changes from weakly ionized in the photosphere, partially ionized in the chromosphere, to eventually fully ionized in the corona. However, it is still not trivial to integrate ionization and recombination processes into multi-fluid solar plasma models with gravitational stratification. Aims. We intend to provide a method for constructing multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratification that satisfies ionization equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium at the same time, avoiding causing non-physical disturbances and numerical instability due to initial in-equilibria. Methods. We assume that collisional interactions between fluids are sufficient for coupling all fluids when there is no high-frequency external driving force imposed. Ionization fractions can be (I) calculated assuming ionization in statistical equilibrium at any given temperature, or (II) extracted from other atmospheric models. A simple numerical integration routine is then designed and used to construct multi-fluid-multi-species gravitational stratifications. Results. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present numerical integration routine can be in hydrostatic equilibrium with any given ionization fractions of multi-species plasmas. Meanwhile, without any dynamic driving force, fluid decoupling appears in the transition region of the constructed stratification, while the total velocity of all fluids remains zero. Conclusions. A gravitational stratification constructed using the present routine can be used in multi-fluid-multi-species models to study specific dynamics without being affected by initial in-equilibria.

TL;DR: Solar wind expansion reshapes compressive fluctuations, increasing magnetic compressibility with distance and explaining the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between 0.3-1 AU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how radial solar wind expansion affects the dispersive properties of MHD waves and explains observed changes in compressive fluctuations with heliocentric distance.

Method: Using the Expanding Box Model with Parker spiral geometry, constructing dispersion tensor from linearized MHD-EBM equations, deriving analytical expressions for eigenfrequencies, magnetic compressibility, and electric/magnetic field ratios.

Result: Magnetic compressibility increases with distance, aligning better with observations when expansion is included. Fast mode becomes more electrostatic while slow mode becomes more magnetically dominated. Expansion reduces growth of electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii.

Conclusion: Solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between compressive modes and transverse fluctuations, playing a major role in shaping wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.

Abstract: In this work, we quantify the effects of solar wind expansion on the dispersive properties of the three normal modes of ideal MHD using the Expanding Box Model, under a background magnetic field that follows the Parker spiral geometry. From the linearized MHD-EBM equations, we construct the dispersion tensor and derive analytical expressions for the eigenfrequencies $ω(k,R)$, magnetic compressibility $C_B$, and the ratio of the parallel electric field to the perpendicular magnetic field $|δE_\parallel|/|δB_\perp|$ of the magnetosonic modes to quantify how radial solar wind expansion reshapes the character of compressive fluctuations in the solar wind. Magnetic compressibility increases with heliocentric distance, and this trend shows a better alignment with in-situ observations when expansion is included from the MHD-EBM framework. $C_B$ shows a well-defined minimum at small radii and then increases linearly with distance, which naturally reproduces the observed transition from Alfvénic to compressive fluctuations between $\sim$0.3-1 AU. The ratio $|δE_\parallel|/|δB_\perp|$ reveals opposite behaviors for the fast and slow modes: while the fast mode becomes more electrostatic with increasing distance, the slow mode evolves to a more magnetically dominated character. Expansion reduces the growth of their electromagnetic/compressive balance at large radii. Our results demonstrate that solar wind expansion actively redistributes energy between magnetically compressive modes and purely transverse fluctuations with respect to the background magnetic field, playing a major role in shaping the radial evolution of wave dynamics throughout the inner heliosphere.

*Anthony R. Yeates,Gunnar Hornig*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: Relative magnetic helicity in solar physics avoids gauge ambiguity but has physical interpretation issues. The paper shows that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for magnetic energy and free energy, generalizing Arnol'd inequality. A stronger bound is derived using a new invariant called unsigned helicity.

Motivation: Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to study magnetic fields in open domains, but its physical interpretation is difficult due to the reference field. The authors aim to provide clearer physical meaning and energy bounds for relative helicity.

Method: The authors use an intrinsic expression for relative helicity in spherical shell domains that doesn't require calculating the reference field or its vector potential. They prove energy bounds and derive a stronger bound by spatially decomposing relative helicity over a magnetic partition to create a new invariant called unsigned helicity.

Result: The paper proves that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the Arnol'd inequality. A stronger energy bound is obtained using unsigned helicity. These bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields and a non-potential data-driven solar corona model.

Conclusion: Relative helicity and unsigned helicity can influence solar corona dynamics through their energy bounds. The results provide clearer physical interpretation and practical applications for studying magnetic fields in solar physics.

Abstract: Relative magnetic helicity is commonly used in solar physics to avoid the well known gauge ambiguity of standard magnetic helicity in magnetically open domains. But its physical interpretation is difficult owing to the invocation of a reference field. For the specific case of spherical shell domains (with potential reference field), relative helicity may be written intrinsically in terms of the magnetic field alone, without the need to calculate the reference field or its vector potential. We use this intrinsic expression to prove that non-zero relative helicity implies lower bounds for both magnetic energy and free magnetic energy, generalizing the important Arnol'd inequality known for closed-field magnetic helicity. Further, we derive a stronger energy bound by spatially decomposing the relative helicity over a magnetic partition of the domain to obtain a new ideal invariant which we call unsigned helicity. The bounds are illustrated with analytical linear force-free fields (that maximize relative helicity for given boundary conditions) as well as a non-potential data-driven model of the solar corona. These bounds confirm that both relative helicity and the unsigned helicity can influence the dynamics in the solar corona.

TL;DR: Streamline topology and energy cascade self-organization in plasma turbulence differs between compressible and incompressible regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how local streamline topology and energy cascade rates self-organize in plasma turbulence across both compressible and incompressible regimes.

Method: Used fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation to quantify subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures using gradient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field.

Result: For nearly-incompressible fluctuations, energy transfers to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, but back-transfers to larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations show no clear topological selection - cascade direction determined by sign of -∇·u (compression vs expansion).

Conclusion: Streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence, with distinct mechanisms governing energy transfer in compressible versus incompressible plasma turbulence regimes.

Abstract: We examine how local streamline topology and energy cascade rate self-organize in plasma turbulence for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Using a fully-compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we quantify the subgrid-scale energy transfer and analyze its relationship to streamline structures by means of grandient tensor geometric invariants of the velocity field. Our results highlight how streamline topology is crucial for diagnosing turbulence: for nearly-incompressible fluctuations the energy is primarily transferred to smaller scales through strain-dominated and stable-vortical structures, while is back-transferred towards larger scales through unstable-vortical structures. Compressible fluctuations, on the contrary, do not show a clear topological selection of the energy transfer since the overall direction of the local cascade rate is found to be determined by the sign of $-\nabla\cdot u$ (plasma volumetric compression or expansion).

### [46] [Viscous Approximation of Optimal Control Problems Governed by Rate-Independent Systems with Non-Convex Energies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05862)
*Merlin Andreia,Christian Meyer*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Viscous regularization of rate-independent optimal control problems with non-convex energy enables convergence to original global optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rate-independent systems with non-convex energy pose challenging optimal control problems that are difficult to solve directly. The original problem is hard to tackle numerically due to its complexity.

Method: Approximate the state equation via viscous regularization using a hierarchy of two different Hilbert spaces. This transforms the problem into an optimal control problem subject to a non-smooth ODE in Hilbert space, which is substantially easier to solve numerically.

Result: Every sequence of globally optimal solutions of the viscous problems admits a (weakly) converging subsequence whose limit is a globally optimal solution of the original problem, provided the original problem has at least one optimal solution with a continuous-in-time optimal state.

Conclusion: Viscous regularization provides a viable numerical approach for solving challenging rate-independent optimal control problems with non-convex energy, with guaranteed convergence to global optima under appropriate continuity conditions.

Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem governed by a rate-inde\-pendent system with non-convex energy. The state equation is approximated by means of viscous regularization w.r.t.\ to hierarchy of two different Hilbert spaces. The regularized problem corresponds to an optimal control problem subject to a non-smooth ODE in Hilbert space, which is substantially easier to solve than the original optimal control problem. The convergence properties of the viscous regularization are investigated. It is shown that every sequence of globally optimal solutions of the viscous problems admits a (weakly) converging subsequence whose limit is a globally optimal solution of the original problem, provided that the latter admits at least one optimal solution with an optimal state that is continuous in time.

TL;DR: This paper investigates aerosol-mediated viral transmission through three interconnected studies: droplet size evolution modeling, molecular reflection coefficients from MD simulations, and a thermodynamically consistent diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively assess airborne infection risk under varying environmental conditions by understanding aerosol droplet dynamics at different length and time scales, particularly focusing on how droplet evaporation affects viral load in air.

Method: Three complementary approaches: 1) Sharp droplet-air interface model for droplet size evolution with exact solution; 2) Molecular Dynamics simulations to extract water molecule reflection coefficients; 3) Thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model (Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system) for solute-containing droplets.

Result: Viral load in air depends sensitively on relative humidity; water molecule reflection is negligible at room temperature but rises significantly at elevated temperatures and grazing incidence; the diffuse-interface model reproduces and generalizes sharp-interface model features.

Conclusion: These interconnected studies provide a comprehensive framework for understanding aerosol droplet evaporation dynamics, which is crucial for quantitatively assessing airborne infection risks under different environmental conditions.

Abstract: We investigate three aspects of aerosol-mediated air-borne viral infection mechanisms on different length and time scales. First, we address the evolution of the size distribution of a non-interacting ensemble of droplets that are subject to evaporation and sedimentation using a sharp droplet-air interface model. From the exact solution of the evolution equation we derive the viral load in the air and show that it depends sensitively on the relative humidity. Secondly, from Molecular Dynamics simulations we extract the molecular reflection coefficient of single water molecules from the air-water interface. This parameter determines the water condensation and evaporation rate at a liquid droplet surface and therefore the evaporation rate of aqueous droplets. We find the reflection of water to be negligible at room temperature but to rise significantly at elevated temperatures and for grazing incidence angles. Thirdly, we derive a thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets that is formulated as a three-phase Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system. By numerically solving the coupled system of equations, we explore representative scenarios that show that this model reproduces and generalizes features of the sharp-interface model. These interconnected studies on the dynamics of aerosol droplet evaporation are relevant in order to quantitatively assess the airborne infection risk under varying environmental conditions.

TL;DR: ESM3 protein language model's evolutionary knowledge distilled into GNN for accurate implicit solvent model that works for both folded and disordered proteins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit solvent models (ISMs) have remained insufficiently accurate for critical applications like protein folding and intrinsically disordered proteins, despite decades of development. Traditional analytical formulas have limitations, and developing a transferable, data-driven ISM is a central challenge.

Method: Distill evolutionary information from protein language model ESM3 into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). Train GNN potential on effective energies from ESM3, then combine with standard electrostatics term to create a hybrid model.

Result: The GNN potential is robust enough for stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. The hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins.

Conclusion: This approach yields a single, unified model transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, it delivers a foundational implicit solvent model for predictive, large-scale simulation tools.

Abstract: Implicit solvent models (ISMs) promise to deliver the accuracy of explicit solvent simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, despite decades of development, their accuracy has remained insufficient for many critical applications, particularly for simulating protein folding and the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Developing a transferable, data-driven ISM that overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical formulas remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy that distills the evolutionary information learned by a protein language model, ESM3, into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). We show that this GNN potential, trained on effective energies from ESM3, is robust enough to drive stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. When combined with a standard electrostatics term, our hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. This approach yields a single, unified model that is transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By successfully distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, our work delivers a foundational implicit solvent model poised to accelerate the development of predictive, large-scale simulation tools.
