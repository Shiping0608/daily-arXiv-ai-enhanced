Our approach exactly conserves the continuous system's key invariants (mass and $L^2$-energy), while also maintaining discrete state-adjoint duality at every time step. These properties are achieved by integrating a centered finite-volume discretization in space with a time-symmetric Crank-Nicolson integrator for both the forward advection and its adjoint, all inside a gradient-based optimization loop. The result is a numerical solver that is faithful to the continuous optimality conditions and efficiently computes mixing-enhancing controls. In our numerical tests, the optimized time-dependent stirring produces a nearly exponential decay of a chosen mix-norm, achieving orders-of-magnitude faster mixing than any single steady flow. To our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that enforcing physical structure at the discrete level can lead to both exact conservation and highly effective mixing outcomes in optimal flow design."}

Eventhough it is an interesting model in itsef, it can also be regarded as a one-dimensional version of the momentum balance of Hibler's model for sea-ice dynamics. Therein, the stress tensor is given by a term with similar properties as the 1-Laplacian in order to account for plastic effects of the ice. For our analysis we start out from a viscoplastic Burgers equation, i.e., a suitably regularized version of the plastic Burgers equation with a small regularization parameter $\\varepsilon>0$. For the viscoplastic Burgers equation, we construct a global BV-solution. In the singular limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$ we deduce the existence of a BV-solution for the plastic Burgers equation.

In this paper, we define as internal time the ``number of kinds'' of codes that have been observed at least once up to a given time, and analyze how the way internal time advances is determined by the statistics of information input (arrival rate and code distribution). When arrivals follow a Poisson process, the average advancing speed of internal time decreases monotonically with time, and if the number of kinds of codes is finite, it eventually approaches an upper limit and saturates. As a result, on long time scales, internal time becomes relatively shorter than physical time. For a uniform code distribution, we provide a closed form for the correspondence between internal time and physical time, and show that the physical time required to ``advance internal time by one step'' increases in later stages. As an ancillary quantity, we quantify by conditional entropy the remaining uncertainty of ``which codes have been observed'' when only internal time is known, and we give unimodality and the maximization time in the uniform case, and upper bounds, equality conditions, and expressions of the difference from the upper bound in the non-uniform case.

In this work, a mixed gas of 75% argon and 25% air is used to generate a pattern discharge. A double-gap boundary composed of hexagonal configuration and square configuration is employed, and the gas pressure is fixed at 20 kPa. By varying the applied voltage amplitude, single-ring pattern, square-point-line pattern, square lattice pattern, and annular-lattice pattern are obtained for the first time. The discharge characteristics and their temporal correlation are studied using both optical method and electrical method. The results show that the discharge patterns exhibit multiple discharges in each half of the voltage cycle, and these discharges are temporally correlated with each other. Time-resolved discharge images of the square lattice pattern are captured using an enhanced charge-coupled device (ICCD). The experimental results reveal that multiple discharges in a half-voltage cycle correspond to the ignition process of the pattern in the radial direction from the outside to the inside.

This work provides a unified mathematical foundation for both formulations. Under mild regularity assumptions on the activation function and for sufficiently wide neural networks of depth at least two, we prove that both the AD- and FD-PINN optimization problems are ill-posed: whenever a minimizer exists, there are in fact infinitely many, and uniqueness fails regardless of the choice of collocation points or finite-difference stencil. Nevertheless, we establish two structural properties. First, whenever the underlying PDE or its finite-difference discretization admits a solution, the corresponding AD-PINN or FD-PINN loss also admits a minimizer, realizable by a neural network of finite width. Second, FD-PINNs are tightly coupled to the underlying finite-difference scheme: every FD-PINN minimizer agrees with a finite-difference minimizer on the grid, and in regimes where the discrete PDE solution is unique, all zero-loss FD-PINN minimizers coincide with the discrete PDE solution on the stencil. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical insights: FD-PINNs remain stable in representative forward and inverse problems, including settings where AD-PINNs may fail to converge. We also include an inverse problem with noisy data, demonstrating that FD-PINNs retain robustness in this setting as well. Taken together, our results clarify the analytical limitations of AD-PINNs and explain the structural reasons for the more stable behavior observed in FD-PINNs."}

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $ρ_0^β\\in H^3$ with $β\\in (\\frac{1}{3},γ-1]$ ($γ$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $β=γ-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $γ\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $ρ_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid.

These problems are commonly formulated as constrained black-box searches over rugged objective landscapes, where function evaluations are expensive, and gradients are unavailable or unreliable. Conventional global search engines and optimizers struggle in such settings due to the exponential scaling of design spaces, the presence of multiple local basins, and the absence of physical guidance in sampling. We present a physics-informed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that extends policy-driven tree-based reinforcement concepts to continuous, high-dimensional scientific optimization. Our method integrates population-level decision trees with surrogate-guided directional sampling, reward shaping, and hierarchical switching between global exploration and local exploitation. These ingredients allow efficient traversal of non-convex, multimodal landscapes where physically meaningful optima are sparse. We benchmark our approach against standard global optimization baselines on a suite of canonical test functions, demonstrating superior or comparable performance in terms of convergence, robustness, and generalization. Beyond synthetic tests, we demonstrate physics-consistent applicability to (i) crystal structure optimization from clusters to bulk, (ii) fitting of classical interatomic potentials, and (iii) constrained engineering design problems.

The method follows a discretize-then-project strategy: the full-order operators are first assembled using finite volume or finite element discretizations and then projected onto low-dimensional spaces using a small set of spatial sampling points, selected through hyper-reduction techniques such as DEIM. This approach removes the dependence of the online computational cost on the full mesh size. The method is assessed on three benchmark problems: a linear transport equation, a nonlinear Burgers equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The results show that the hyper-reduced models closely match full-order solutions while achieving substantial reductions in computational time. Since only a sparse subset of mesh cells is evaluated during the online phase, the method is naturally parallelizable and scalable to very large meshes. These findings demonstrate that hyper-reduction can be effectively combined with segregated solvers and geometric parametrization to enable fast and accurate CFD simulations."}

However, the CSI feedback overhead becomes a major bottleneck as the number of antennas increases. Although existing deep learning-based CSI compression methods have shown great potential, they still face limitations in capturing both local and global features of CSI, thereby limiting achievable compression efficiency. To address these issues, we propose TCLNet, a unified CSI compression framework that integrates a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture for lossy compression with a hybrid language model (LM) and factorized model (FM) design for lossless compression. The lossy module jointly exploits local features and global context, while the lossless module adaptively switches between context-aware coding and parallel coding to optimize the rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) trade-off. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed TCLNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and transmission efficiency, achieving up to a 5 dB performance gain across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we show that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged as zero-shot CSI lossless compressors via carefully designed prompts."}

This interaction is mediated by a transient ablation pressure, whose complex spatio-temporal evolution remains experimentally inaccessible. Existing modeling approaches are limited: Empirical pressure-impulse models neglect dynamic plasma feedback, while advanced radiation-hydrodynamic codes often fail to resolve late-time droplet hydrodynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a radiation two-phase flow model based on a diffuse interface methodology. The model integrates radiation hydrodynamics for the plasma with the Euler equations for a weakly compressible liquid, extending a five-equation diffuse interface formulation to incorporate radiation transport, thermal conduction, and ionization. This formulation enforces pressure and velocity equilibrium across the diffuse interface region, with closure models constructed to ensure correct jump conditions at interfaces and asymptotically recover the pure-phase equations in bulk regions. Then, we apply the model to simulate a benchmark pre-pulse scenario, where a 50 micron tin droplet is irradiated by a 10 ns laser pulse. The simulations capture the rapid plasma expansion and subsequent inertial flattening of the droplet into a thin, curved sheet over microsecond timescales. Notably, the model reproduces experimentally observed features (such as an axial jet) rarely replicated in prior simulations. Quantitative agreement with experimental data for sheet dimensions and velocity validates the approach. The proposed model self-consistently couples laser-plasma physics with compressible droplet dynamics, providing a powerful tool for fundamental studies of plasma-liquid interactions in LPP-EUV source optimization."}

However, its formulation is for temporal dynamics and does not directly accommodate parametric variability, which limits its applicability to tasks such as design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification. In order to address the limitations, a \\emph{Parametric Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition} (PPMD) is presented to deal with parametric problems. The central advantage of PPMD is its ability to construct continuous, high-fidelity parametric surrogates while retaining the transparency and non-intrusive workflow of PMD. By integrating probabilistic-manifold embeddings with parameter-aware latent learning, PPMD enables smooth predictions across unseen parameter values (such as different boundary or initial conditions). To validate the proposed method, a comprehensive convergence analysis is established for PPMD, covering the approximation of the linear principal subspace, the geometric recovery of the nonlinear solution manifold, and the statistical consistency of the kernel ridge regression used for latent learning. The framework is then numerically demonstrated on two classic flow configurations: flow past a cylinder and backward-facing step flow.

To construct these paths, we develop GeoNEB, a path optimizer integrating efficient stochastic reconfiguration with the nudged elastic band method for constructing minimum energy paths.

By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."}

We present a new approach that overcomes this limitation and can efficiently handle primes with larger bitsizes. The key idea is to use multiword decompositions, which represent A and B as scaled sums of u and v matrices (words) with smaller coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis that proves the correctness of this approach for suitably chosen scaling parameters. Our analysis determines the maximum bitsize of p that can be handled for a given number of words; in particular, we show that decomposing in two words each input suffices to handle bitsizes almost equal to the full mantissa size (e.g., the 26 bits limit is raised to 52 bits in double precision arithmetic). Moreover, we show that (1,v) decompositions with v>1 are also of interest to handle intermediate bitsizes. We perform an extensive experimental analysis for various matrix shapes and prime bitsizes. Our performance benchmarks on both CPU and GPU architectures confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach, which can outperform the existing single word approach for bitsizes as low as 23, and can handle bitsizes as high as 52 while retaining high performance."}

Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials."}

Our approach is based on a mixed formulation involving a displacement field and a Lagrange multiplier, enforcing the contact conditions, representing tractions at fractures. The approximation space for the displacement is made of vectors values attached to each vertex, edge, face, and element, while the Lagrange multiplier space is approximated by piecewise constant vectors on each fracture face. The displacement degrees of freedom allow reconstruct piecewise quadratic approximations of this field. We prove a discrete Korn inequality that account for the fractures, as well as an inf-sup condition (in a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm) between the discrete Lagrange multiplier space and the discrete displacement space. We provide an in-depth error analysis of the scheme and show that, contrary to usual low-order nodal-based schemes, our method is robust in the quasi-incompressible limit for the primal variable~(displacement). An extensive set of numerical experiments confirms the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical accuracy and robustness of the scheme."}

The system describes creeping two-phase flows and is basically a coupling of the Brinkman equation for the velocity field that governs the flow through the porous media coupled with convective Cahn-Hilliard equations for the phase field, both with two independent sources of randomness given by general multiplicative-type Wiener noises in the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The existence of a weak solution, both in the probabilistic and PDEs sense, is proved. Our construction of a solution is based on the classical Faedo-Galerkin approximation, the Yosida approximation and uses a compactness method. Our paper is the first attempt to generalize the paper \\cite{Colli+Knopf+Schimperna+Signor_2024} to a stochastic setting."}

The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."}

Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\\'ı}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.\n  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities."}

We propose a training framework that couples a continuous-time form of operator inference with the adjoint-state method to obtain robust data-driven reduced-order models. This method minimizes a trajectory-based loss between reduced-order solutions and projected snapshot data, which removes the need to estimate time derivatives from noisy measurements and provides intrinsic temporal regularization through time integration. We derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equations to compute gradients efficiently and implement a gradient based optimizer to update the reduced model parameters. Each iteration only requires one forward reduced order solve and one adjoint solve, followed by inexpensive gradient assembly, making the method attractive for large-scale simulations. We validate the proposed method on three partial differential equations: viscous Burgers' equation, the two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, and an advection-diffusion equation. We perform systematic comparisons against standard operator inference under two perturbation regimes, namely reduced temporal snapshot density and additive Gaussian noise. For clean data, both approaches deliver similar accuracy, but in situations with sparse sampling and noise, the proposed adjoint-based training provides better accuracy and enhanced roll-out stability."}

Numerical simulations demonstrate that taking the relaxation parameter proportional to the time between observations allows one to vary the observation frequency over a wide range while maintaining convergence of the approximating solution to the reference solution. Under the same assumptions we analytically prove that taking the observation frequency to infinity results in the continuous-in-time nudging method."}

However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can improve computational efficiency and flexibility. Yet, standard RBF-KANs often sacrifice accuracy relative to the original KAN design. In this work, we propose Free-RBF-KAN, a RBF-based KAN architecture that incorporates adaptive learning grids and trainable smoothness to close this performance gap. Our method employs freely learnable RBF shapes that dynamically align grid representations with activation patterns, enabling expressive and adaptive function approximation. Additionally, we treat smoothness as a kernel parameter optimized jointly with network weights, without increasing computational complexity. We provide a general universality proof for RBF-KANs, which encompasses our Free-RBF-KAN formulation. Through a broad set of experiments, including multiscale function approximation, physics-informed machine learning, and PDE solution operator learning, Free-RBF-KAN achieves accuracy comparable to the original B-spline-based KAN while delivering faster training and inference. These results highlight Free-RBF-KAN as a compelling balance between computational efficiency and adaptive resolution, particularly for high-dimensional structured modeling tasks."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We report partial progress on the weak coupling limit behavior of observables for the periodic quantum Lorentz gas. Our results indicate that for certain observables, the limit behavior is trivial and can be described via a transport equation, while for other observables, the existence of the limit hinges on the regularity properties at resonant momenta of a certain Bloch-Wigner transform. We are currently unable to prove or disprove this regularity property, and so the weak coupling limit for these observables remains an open question. A novelty of this work is the use of the sewing lemma in the derivation of the kinetic scaling limit for almost every mometum."}
