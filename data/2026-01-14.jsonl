In histopolation, the available input data does not consist of pointwise function samples but of averages taken over intervals or higher-dimensional regions, and these mean values serve as a basis for reconstructing or approximating the target function. While classical interpolation requires continuity of the underlying function, histopolation can be performed in larger function spaces. In the framework of kernel methods, we will introduce and study the so-called averaging kernel Hilbert spaces (AKHS's) for this purpose. Within this setting, we develop systematic construction principles for averaging kernels and provide characterizations based on the Fourier-Plancherel transform. In addition, we analyze several representative histopolation scenarios in order to highlight properties of this approximation method, including conditions for unisolvence and possible error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments that shed some light on the convergence behavior of the presented approach and demonstrate its practical effectiveness."}

It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples."}

Eigenspaces and eigenvalues of rational functions of such operators are studied as a first step. Under an assumption of convergence of resolvent approximations in the operator norm and an assumption on global reliability of source problem error estimators, we show that the gap in eigenspace approximations can be bounded by a globally reliable and computable error estimator. Also included are applications of the theoretical framework to first-order system least squares (FOSLS) discretizations and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) discretizations, both yielding new estimators for the error gap. Numerical experiments with a selfadjoint model problem and with a leaky nonselfadjoint waveguide eigenproblem show that adaptive algorithms using the new estimators give refinement patterns that target the cluster as a whole instead of individual eigenfunctions."}

However, state-of-the-art trajectory analysis methods infer bonding from instantaneous distance thresholds, which can misclassify transient, nonreactive encounters as bonds and thereby introduce spurious intermediates, distorted reaction networks, and biased rate estimates. Here, we introduce ChemXDyn, a dynamics-aware computational methodology that leverages time-resolved interatomic distance signatures as a core principle to robustly identify chemically consistent bonded interactions and, consequently, extract meaningful reaction pathways. In particular, ChemXDyn propagates molecular connectivity through time while enforcing atomic valence and coordination constraints to distinguish genuine bond-breaking and bond-forming events from transient, nonreactive encounters. We evaluate ChemXDyn on ReaxFF MD simulations of hydrogen and ammonia oxidation and on neural-network potential MD simulations of methane oxidation, and benchmark its performance against widely used trajectory analysis methods. Across these cases, ChemXDyn suppresses unphysical species prevalent in static analyses, recovers experimentally consistent reaction pathways, and improves the fidelity of rate constant estimation. In ammonia oxidation, ChemXDyn removes unphysical intermediates and resolves key NOx- and N2O-forming and -consuming routes. In methane oxidation, it reconstructs the canonical progression from CH4 to CO2. By linking atomistic dynamics to chemically consistent reaction identification, ChemXDyn provides a transferable foundation for MD-derived reaction networks and kinetics, with potential utility spanning combustion, catalysis, plasma chemistry, and electrochemical environments."}

The aim was to investigate plasma induced modifications in phytochemicals and their subsequent effects on antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Spectroscopic (UV Vis, FTIR) and chromatographic (HPLC) analyses demonstrated structural alterations in key polyphenolic constituents, accompanied by mild acidification and changes in redox potential. Total phenolic content (TPC) and flavonoid levels increased significantly following 10 min PAW treatment, while prolonged exposure (15 min) led to partial degradation, suggesting an optimum treatment window. Antioxidant assays (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP) confirmed improved radical scavenging capacity, correlating with enhanced reducing power of modified phytochemicals. Antimicrobial evaluation against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus revealed synergistic inhibitory effects, with reduced minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for PAW-treated infusions.

This scheme exhibits favorable structural properties that substantially reduce the difficulties arising from coupling and gradient nonlinearities in spatiotemporal HiSD. Exploiting these properties, we establish gradient stability and error estimates, which consequently ensure the preservation of the Morse index for the computed saddle points. The framework is further extended to the semilinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in finding multiple solutions and constructing the solution landscape of semilinear elliptic problems.

Although pretrained atomistic models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy after fine-tuning, their reliability under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains unclear. We identify a critical failure mode in downstream adaptation: standard fine-tuning induces representation collapse, erasing pretrained chemical and structural priors and severely degrading OOD performance. To address this limitation, we propose multi-task fine-tuning (MFT), which jointly optimizes downstream property prediction with a physically grounded force-field objective inherited from pretraining. This approach preserves essential chemical priors while enabling task-specific adaptation. Across molecular and materials benchmarks, MFT consistently improves OOD generalization, approaching the theoretical limit set by in-distribution accuracy, while outperforming standard fine-tuning, training from scratch, and state-of-the-art task-specific models.

The sensor temperature can increase from room temperature to several hundred degrees within a second upon exposure to RF plasma, depending on the experiment's geometry and plasma parameters. Such sensitivity and response time are due to the pre-designed reduced heat capacity of the sensor and significantly reduced thermal conductance of the cooling channels. These features enable the sensitive detection of low-energy plasma fluxes on surfaces and their rapid discrimination, as in the case of ion and electron fluxes, by biasing the sensor at negative or positive potentials. These biased nanocalorimeter energy readings have been compared with ion and electron kinetic energy dissipations assessed using a Langmuir probe and retarding field energy analyzer (RFEA).

We argue that in a rectangular right prism geometry, with longitudinal size much larger than the transverse size, correlations decay exponentially (at all temperatures) along the longitudinal dimension, but the scaling of the correlation length with the transverse size carries crucial information from which the lower critical dimension can be inferred. The method is applied in the particularly demanding context of Ising spin glasses at zero magnetic field. The lower critical dimension and the multifractal spectrum for the correlation function are computed from large-scale numerical simulations. Several technical novelties (such as the unexpectedly crucial performance of Houdayer's cluster method or the convenience of using open - rather than periodic - boundary conditions) allow us to study three-dimensional prisms with transverse dimensions up to $L=24$ and effectively infinite longitudinal dimensions down to low temperatures. The value that we find for the lower critical dimension turns out to be in agreement with expectations from both the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory and the Droplet model for spin glasses. We argue that our novel setting holds promise in clarifying which of the two competing theories more accurately describes three-dimensional spin glasses."}

While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($η~\\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the \"frozen-in\" condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, identifying magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection."}

Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes.\n  Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.\n  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions. In particular, it suggests parameter regimes where clusters of hybrid dimers can generate (double) negative effective permittivity and permeability and bi-anisotropic constitutive laws and eventually hyperbolic media."}

Using a multi-component analytical model that incorporates the diffuse warm ionized medium together with localized H II regions, supernova remnants (SNR), and stellar-wind bubbles (SWB), we derive location-dependent coefficients governing KA dispersion and nonlinearity. The reductive perturbation method is applied to obtain Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations, enabling the characterization of solitons under realistic astrophysical conditions. Numerical analysis demonstrates how superthermality, plasma $β$, temperature, and density gradients modulate soliton amplitude, width, and stability. Our results reveal distinct exclusion zones (EZs) for KA solitons in high-$β$ HII regions and SWB/SNR interiors, as well as ultra low-$β$ regions near central pulsar wind nebulae. While H II regions exhibit simple Gaussian-driven depletions, the complex ``hole-and-shell\" morphologies of SWBs and SNRs imprint sharp spatial variations and discontinuities on soliton properties.

FSI coupling is achieved using a fictitious domain methodology with variational multiscale stabilization for enhanced accuracy on under-resolved grids expected with unfitted meshes used in immersed FSI. A fully implicit, monolithic scheme provides robust coupling for strongly coupled FSI characteristic of cardiovascular applications.

Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations.

Langevin dynamics simulations are used to study the evolution of perturbations at the interface between these two distinct species of charged dust particles, subject to an externally applied electric field and an equilibrium charge density gradient. We have performed analytical calculations to determine the growth rate of instability under both strongly coupled and weakly coupled dusty plasma regimes. These theoretical predictions are subsequently validated through molecular dynamics simulations, enabling the reproduction of the instability in a strongly coupled binary complex plasma.

This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. However, despite the intense research activity, the reported values for exciton binding energies, quasiparticle gaps, and spectral features exhibit substantial variation across both experimental and theoretical studies. In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights.

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases. This study underlines that, thanks to its structure, the energy-variational solution is better suited for variational convergence methods than the dissipative solution."}

We further derive a residual-based a posteriori error estimator and prove its reliability using global inf-sup conditions, Helmholtz decompositions, and suitable projection operators, while efficiency is ensured through localization techniques and bubble functions. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the theoretical results, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive refinement for singular solutions and complex geometries with inclusions, and illustrate the robustness of the method for a bioconvective benchmark with plume formation governed by an Einstein--Batchelor-type viscosity law."}

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in sampling recovery, focusing on the accuracy of various algorithms and the relationship between optimal recovery errors, nonlinear approximation, and the Kolmogorov widths of function classes. A central theme is the synergy between the theory of universal sampling discretization and Lebesgue-type inequalities for greedy algorithms. We discuss three primary algorithmic frameworks: weighted least squares and $\\ell_p$ minimization, sparse approximation methods, and greedy algorithms such as the Weak Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (WOMP) in Hilbert spaces and the Weak Tchebychev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in Banach spaces. These methods are applied to function classes defined by structural conditions, like the $A_β^r$ and Wiener-type classes, as well as classical Sobolev-type classes with dominated mixed derivatives. Notably, we highlight recent findings showing that nonlinear sampling recovery can provide superior error guarantees compared to linear methods for certain multivariate function classes."}

To obtain this, we also establish several auxiliary results, including: the minimality of the level sets of the minimizers, explicit bounds on the oscillations of the minimizers, density estimates for almost minimizers, and non-local perimeter estimates in the large."}

We begin with explicit examples where bounded initial data leads to $L^{\\infty}$ blow-up despite flux regularity. More strikingly, we demonstrate that Kružkov's entropy equalities alone fail to ensure uniqueness in this regime by constructing infinitely many entropy solutions to a single Cauchy problem with bounded initial datum, each continuous in time with respect to the $L^{1}$ norm. Thus, we demonstrate that the $L^{\\infty}$ assumption is essential for the doubling of variables argument, and hence for the uniqueness of entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws. On the positive side, we develop a novel theory for scalar conservation laws with spatial heterogeneity by adapting the front tracking method. We recover uniqueness by imposing a Lax-type condition in addition to the entropy inequality, motivated by the properties of our front tracking approximations. Unbounded Kružkov solutions do not necessarily satisfy the weak formulation; we show that global weak solutions may not even exist in a natural class for some Cauchy problems of this form, even when Kružkov entropy solutions exist. Finally, we construct an explicit example of global ill-posedness with bounded initial datum."}

In the Minkowski context, we prove similar results for hypersurface without timelike points."}

We prove the comparison principle for continuous OPSH functions and the quasicontinuity of locally bounded ones. An important tool is a formula of integration by parts for mixed octonionic Monge-Ampère operator. Various useful properties of octonionic relative extremal functions and octonionic capacity are established. The main difficulty is the non-associativity of octonions. However, some weak form of associativity can be used to covercome this difficulty. Another important ingredient in pluripotential theory is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous octonionic Monge-Ampère equation on the unit ball, for which we show the $C_{loc}^{1,1}$-regularity by applying Bedford-Taylor's method. The obstacle to do so is that an OPSH function is usually not OPSH under automorphisms of the unit ball. This issue can be solved by finding a weighted transformation formula of OPSH functions."}

This nonlinear wave equation is widely used in nonlinear acoustics and it is especially important in biomedical applications such as ultra-sound imaging in human tissue. Modern methods are applied to uncover point symmetries and conservation laws that can lead to useful developments concerning solutions and their properties. A complete classification of point symmetries is shown for the arbitrary function. Local low-order conservation laws related to net mass of sound waves are obtained by the multiplier method. Two potential systems are derived yielding potential symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws. For the physical case interesting for this equation, travelling wave solutions are studied leading to shock waves."}

This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue."}

We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces."}

However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or \"heterogeneous\" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the Itô-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation."}
