Observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) of electrostatic waves suggest that electrostatic instabilities, including the ion-ion-acoustic instability (IIAI) frequently observed in the inner heliosphere, play an important role in plasma heating and particle acceleration. Aims. Our aim is to explore the application of single spacecraft diagnostics to the IIAI, in anticipation of application to the current missions operating in the inner heliosphere, e.g. PSP and Solar Orbiter. Methods. We apply the field-particle correlation (FPC) technique to fully kinetic simulations of IIAI. We characterize the conversion of energy between the electric field and particle species, allowing the differentiation between oscillatory and secular energy transfer to and from the particles and highlighting the role of resonant energy exchange. We then identify the characteristic IIAI signatures for the proton and electron distributions, and relate them to our previous knowledge of IIAI onset and energy exchange mechanisms. Results. Applying the FPC technique to our simulations run in parameters regime compatible with solar wind conditions, we have identified IIAI signatures that would enable efficient recognition of IIAI in observations.

A central modeling task is investigating parameter sensitivity, whether tuning atmospheric coefficients, computing financial Greeks, or optimizing neural networks. These sensitivities are mathematically expressed as derivatives of an objective function with respect to parameters of interest and are rarely available analytically, necessitating numerical methods for approximating them. While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require.\n  This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative. Tale 1 demonstrates differentiating through discretized SDEs, known the discretize-optimize approach, is reliable for both It\u00f4 and Stratonovich calculus. Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients. Our aim is to equip readers with a clear guide on the numerical differentiation of SDEs: computing gradients correctly in both It\u00f4 and Stratonovich settings, understanding when discretize-optimize and optimize-discretize agree or diverge, and developing intuition for reasoning about stochastic differentiation beyond the cases explicitly covered.", "AI": {"tldr": "A primer on numerical differentiation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) covering two approaches: discretize-optimize (differentiating through discretized SDEs) and optimize-discretize (continuous limit analysis), with guidance on computing gradients correctly in both It\u00f4 and Stratonovich calculus.", "motivation": "Dynamical systems modeling requires parameter sensitivity analysis across physics, finance, economics, and machine learning.

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model.

Final Version. To appear in the Journal of Differential Equations", "summary": "In this paper, we establish nonexistence results for complete translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow under suitable growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature and on the norm of the second fundamental form. We first show that such solitons cannot be entirely contained in the complement of a right rotational cone whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the translation direction. We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nonexistence results for complete translating solitons of r-mean curvature flow under growth conditions on curvature and second fundamental form.", "motivation": "To establish geometric constraints on translating solitons of r-mean curvature flow by proving nonexistence results under certain curvature growth conditions and spatial constraints.", "method": "The authors use geometric analysis techniques to prove three main nonexistence theorems: 1) solitons cannot be contained in complement of rotational cones aligned with translation direction, 2) properly immersed solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to translation direction, 3) solitons cannot lie within intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces.", "result": "Three main nonexistence results are established for complete translating solitons under appropriate growth conditions on (r-1)-mean curvature and norm of second fundamental form, providing geometric restrictions on their possible configurations in space.", "conclusion": "Complete translating solitons of r-mean curvature flow are subject to significant geometric constraints, particularly regarding their spatial confinement relative to the translation direction, when curvature growth conditions are satisfied."}}

However, aside from some exactly solvable one-dimensional examples, very little is known if the searcher diffusivity varies in space. For such space-dependent or \"heterogeneous\" diffusion, one must specify the interpretation of the multiplicative noise, which is termed the It\u00f4-Stratonovich dilemma. In this paper, we investigate how stochastic search with space-dependent diffusivity depends on this interpretation. We obtain general formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the stochastic search time and the so-called splitting probabilities assuming that the targets are small or weakly reactive. These asymptotic results are valid for general space-dependent diffusivities in general domains in any space dimension with targets of general shape which may be in the interior or on the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theory with stochastic simulations. Our analysis predicts that stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes how stochastic search times depend on the It\u00f4 vs Stratonovich interpretation of multiplicative noise when diffusion coefficients vary in space, deriving general formulas for search time distributions and splitting probabilities.", "motivation": "While stochastic search problems are well-studied for constant diffusivity, little is known for space-dependent (heterogeneous) diffusion where the interpretation of multiplicative noise (It\u00f4-Stratonovich dilemma) becomes crucial. The paper aims to understand how search dynamics depend on this interpretation.", "method": "Derived general formulas for probability distribution and moments of stochastic search time and splitting probabilities using asymptotic analysis.

Verified with stochastic simulations.", "result": "Obtained general asymptotic formulas that show stochastic search can depend strongly and counterintuitively on the multiplicative noise interpretation (It\u00f4 vs Stratonovich). The theory works for various domain geometries and target configurations.", "conclusion": "The interpretation of multiplicative noise (It\u00f4-Stratonovich dilemma) significantly impacts stochastic search dynamics with space-dependent diffusivity, with potentially strong and counterintuitive effects that must be considered in modeling heterogeneous diffusion processes."}}
