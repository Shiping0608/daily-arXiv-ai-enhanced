The forward problem is discretized with summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, and interface/boundary and initial/terminal conditions are imposed weakly via simultaneous approximation terms (SAT), yielding a stable monolithic space-time scheme on heterogeneous domains. Stability is proven under specific conditions on the SAT parameters, scaled with the spatial mesh resolution and material properties. We compute design sensitivities using a discrete space-time adjoint scheme that is dual-consistent with the primal SBP-SAT scheme. Dual consistency ensures that the discrete adjoint consistently approximates the continuous dual problem and, under standard smoothness assumptions, yields superconvergent functional estimates. We validate the resulting optimal designs by comparison with an independently computed reference optimal design and report time-to-solution and cost-of-accuracy curves, comparing against low-order time-marching and all-at-once solvers for the forward and adjoint systems. The proposed scheme attains high accuracy with fewer space-time degrees of freedom and remains stable, reducing time-to-solution and memory compared with an alternative all-at-once solver. This makes it a future candidate for large-scale topology optimization of time-dependent thermal systems."}

Spin-orbit coupling gives rise to fascinating phenomena, including supersolid-like phases with spatially modulated densities. However, in such complex settings, conventional numerical approaches, such as generalized inverse iterations or gradient descent, often converge very slowly. To overcome this issue, we apply the concept of the J-method [E.~Jarlebring, S.~Kvaal, W.~Michiels. SIAM~J.~Sci.~Comput.~36-4,~2014] to construct a nonlinear inverse iteration scheme whose convergence can be accelerated through spectral shifting, analogous to techniques used for linear eigenproblems. For a fixed shift parameter, we establish local linear convergence rates determined by spectral gaps in the neighbourhood of each quasi-unique ground state. With adaptively chosen shifts, superlinear convergence is observed, which we verify through numerical experiments."}

It was originally introduced for the homogeneous one-dimensional wave equation in [Ciaramella, Gander, Mazzieri, 2024]. UTP is inspired by the Mapped Tent Pitching (MTP) algorithm [Gopalakrishnan, Sch{ö}berl, Wintersteiger, 2017], which constructs the solution by iteratively building polytopal space--time subdomains, referred to as tents. In MTP, each physical tent is mapped onto a space--time rectangle, where local problems are solved before being mapped back to the original domain. In contrast, UTP avoids the nonlinear and potentially singular mapping step by computing the solution directly on a physical space--time rectangle that contains the tent, at the expense of redundant computations in the region outside the tent. In this work, we investigate several strategies to extend UTP to heterogeneous media, where the wave propagation speed is piecewise constant over two subregions of the domain. Among the considered approaches, the most efficient in terms of computational time is the one employing space--time subdomains with identical spatial and temporal dimensions in both regions, determined by the maximum propagation speed."}

We show that this geometry injects a uniform plane mode ($q_{\\parallel}=0$) that converts the plane-averaged electrostatic potential into a cumulative sum of plane-dipole increments, a random walk in $z$. Consequently, the variance of the plane-averaged potential grows linearly with depth in semi-infinite slabs and follows a parabolic Brownian-bridge profile in finite cells with both ends fixed, with an amplitude inversely proportional to the cell's lateral area. Hence, at any finite area, the variance diverges with slab thickness, a 2D-mode catastrophe. In contrast, a pure 1D chain (no lateral replication) and a fully 3D, nonperiodic medium both exhibit bounded fluctuations that saturate with distance. The mechanism is generic to any solver of Poisson's equation with 2D periodicity, so the apparent growth and ultimate divergence in potential fluctuation are artifacts of boundary conditions rather than material response, and we provide a simple scaling criterion for choosing slab sizes that keeps these artifacts under quantitative control."}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning."}

By creating electron-free targets, stopping power is drastically reduced, enabling conditions where fusion energy surpasses beam energy deposition under practical scenarios. This approach offers a viable alternative pathway to fusion energy without high-temperature plasma confinement and warrants further experimental investigation."}

We first prove that the gradient of the solution remains bounded when the conductors possess partially ``flat\" boundaries. This contrasts with the case involving strictly convex inclusions, where the gradient can blow up. Second, for conductors with $C^{1,γ}$ boundaries ($γ\\in(0,1)$), we establish both upper and lower bounds on the gradient, with optimal blow-up rates. Furthermore, we provide precise asymptotic expansions in some special cases."}

However, existing deep learningbased methods, including recent spatial-frequency frameworks such as AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion, often suffer from a fundamental trade-off between global statistical similaritymeasured by correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI)and local structural fidelity. This paper proposes W-DUALMINE, a reliability-weighted dual-expert fusion framework designed to explicitly resolve this trade-off through architectural constraints and a theoretically grounded loss design. The proposed method introduces dense reliability maps for adaptive modality weighting, a dual-expert fusion strategy combining a global-context spatial expert and a wavelet-domain frequency expert, and a soft gradient-based arbitration mechanism. Furthermore, we employ a residual-to-average fusion paradigm that guarantees the preservation of global correlation while enhancing local details. Extensive experiments on CT-MRI, PET-MRI, and SPECT-MRI datasets demonstrate that W-DUALMINE consistently outperforms AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion in CC and MI metrics while"}

Likelihood-based estimators typically lead to non-convex and possibly multimodal optimization landscapes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may mix exponentially slowly. We propose a class of computationally tractable estimators--plug-in and PDE-penalized M-estimators--for inverse problems defined through operator equations of the form $L_f u = g$, where $f$ is the unknown parameter and $u$ is the observed solution. The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schrödinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems. Our estimators also provide principled warm-start initializations for polynomial-time Bayesian computation."}

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning."}

The aim of this paper is to identify forces generated by a filament-motor network of F-actin and myosin -- actomyosin -- and exerted on the surrounding fluid, therefore causing a fluid flow. In particular, we evaluate optical microscopy data stemming from two different physical settings, confined and non-confined active gels. As a theoretical model, we use the Stokes equation together with an incompressibility condition and suitable boundary conditions reflecting the physical settings. The problem of determining the forces from knowledge on the fluid flow is formulated as an inverse source problem. Due to experimental limitations, only incomplete data are available. We provide a rigorous analysis of the forward problems and the impact of missing data, derive the adjoints of the forward operators needed for regularization, and demonstrate our methods on both synthetic and experimentally measured data."}

By studying the first non-trivial level, given by elliptic functions, we construct: $(i)$ a global $1$-parameter family of periodic solutions to Serrin's problem that interpolates between a flat band and a chain of disks along an axis, following an unduloid pattern, and $(ii)$ for any $n>1$, a two-dimensional moduli space ${\\bf T}_n$ of non-radial Serrin ring domains with a dihedral symmetry group of order $2n$.
