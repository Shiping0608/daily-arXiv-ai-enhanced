The forward problem is discretized with summation-by-parts (SBP) operators, and interface/boundary and initial/terminal conditions are imposed weakly via simultaneous approximation terms (SAT), yielding a stable monolithic space-time scheme on heterogeneous domains. Stability is proven under specific conditions on the SAT parameters, scaled with the spatial mesh resolution and material properties. We compute design sensitivities using a discrete space-time adjoint scheme that is dual-consistent with the primal SBP-SAT scheme. Dual consistency ensures that the discrete adjoint consistently approximates the continuous dual problem and, under standard smoothness assumptions, yields superconvergent functional estimates. We validate the resulting optimal designs by comparison with an independently computed reference optimal design and report time-to-solution and cost-of-accuracy curves, comparing against low-order time-marching and all-at-once solvers for the forward and adjoint systems.

The key idea is to replace the exact PDE constraint by a weakly enforced relaxation, yielding conditionally convex and, in many PDE examples, nested quadratic optimization problems that avoid evaluating the forward map $G(f)$ and do not require PDE solvers. For prototypical non-linear inverse problems arising from elliptic PDEs, including the Darcy flow model $L_f u = \\nabla\\!\\cdot(f\\nabla u)$ and a steady-state Schr\u00f6dinger model, we prove that these estimators attain the best currently known statistical convergence rates while being globally computable in polynomial time. In the Darcy model, we obtain an explicit sub-quadratic $o(N^2)$ arithmetic runtime bound for estimating $f$ from $N$ noisy samples. Our analysis is based on new generalized stability estimates, extending classical stability beyond the range of the forward operator, combined with tools from nonparametric M-estimation. We also derive adaptive rates for the Darcy problem, providing a blueprint for designing provably polynomial-time statistical algorithms for a broad class of non-linear inverse problems.
