Starting with the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for basic epidemic behavior and the predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra, LV) system for ecological interactions, we then combine these frameworks into a coupled Lotka-Volterra-Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (LVSIS) model. The resulting system consists of four differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible and infected prey and predator populations, incorporating ecological interactions, disease transmission, and spatial dispersal. To learn the underlying dynamics directly from data, we employ several data-driven modeling frameworks: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Ordinary Differential Equations (KANODEs), and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Numerical experiments based on synthetic data are conducted to investigate the learning ability of these models in capturing the epidemic and ecological behavior. We further extend our approach to spatio-temporal models, aiming to uncover hidden local couplings."}

In this study, we investigate the associated exit problem and propose a method to compute the exit time probability, which quantifies the likelihood that a trajectory starting from an initial condition exits a bounded region in phase space within a given time. This estimation plays a key role in understanding anomalous diffusion behavior. The proposed method approximates the α-stable process by combining a Brownian motion with a compound Poisson process. The exit time probability is then modeled using a framework based on partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). The Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation of the solution, involving conditional expectations over stochastic differential equations. These expectations are computed via tailored quadrature rules and interpolation techniques. The proposed method achieves first-order convergence in time and offers significant computational advantages over standard Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. In particular, it avoids assembling and solving large dense linear systems, resulting in improved efficiency. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and performance through two numerical examples, highlighting its applicability to physical transport problems."}

The model couples an Allen-Cahn equation for the biomembrane interface with a variable-mobility Cahn-Hilliard equation governing mass exchange across the membrane. Classical approaches, including nonlinear multigrid and Multiple Scalar Auxiliary Variable (MSAV) methods, require iterative solution of variable-coefficient systems at each time step, resulting in substantial computational cost. We introduce a constant-coefficient MSAV (CC-MSAV) scheme that incorporates stabilization directly into the Cahn-Hilliard evolution equation rather than the chemical potential. This reformulation yields fully decoupled constant-coefficient elliptic problems solvable via fast discrete cosine transform (DCT), eliminating iterative solvers entirely. The method achieves O(N^2 log N) complexity per time step while preserving unconditional energy stability and discrete mass conservation. Numerical experiments verify second-order temporal and spatial accuracy, mass conservation to relative errors below 5 x 10^-11, and close agreement with nonlinear multigrid benchmarks. On grids with N >= 2048, CC-MSAV achieves 6-15x overall speedup compared to classical MSAV with optimized preconditioning, while the dominant Cahn-Hilliard subsystem is accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude. These efficiency gains, achieved without sacrificing accuracy, make CC-MSAV particularly well suited for large-scale simulations of vesicle dynamics."}

We perform 1X-2V Boltzmann-Poisson simulations of an axial cut at the pinch radius of a Z-pinch plasma between two biased electrodes with a magnetic field parallel to the wall. The collision frequencies are artificially increased to enhance thermalization of the plasma in the smaller simulation domain versus the actual experiment size; this increases the perpendicular mobility and partially de-magnetizes the ions resulting in non-monotonic sheath profiles with the potential increasing away from the wall to a peak before decaying. A classical sheath forms within an electron gyroradius from the wall not due to the natural thermal motion of the electrons, but due to the magnetized electrons gyrating into the wall; therefore, the sheath structure does not significantly change with bias potential or between electrodes. With increasing bias potential, a current is induced perpendicular to the wall due to changes in ion flow, differing from unmagnetized cases where current is induced by changes in electron flow. The magnetic field acts as a high resistivity with the perpendicular current density being three orders of magnitude lower than unmagnetized theoretical predictions. There is, however, significant flow parallel to the wall from the force balance between the pressure tensor and Lorentz force. These parallel flows induce a parallel current density three orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular current density."}

By interpreting the level set value as a 3-form and its gradient as a 1-form, PFM-LS achieves exceptional geometric fidelity during complex deformations and preserves sub-grid features that traditional methods cannot capture. Our dual-timescale approach utilizes long-range maps for values and gradients, with frequent reinitialization of short-range maps for the distortion-sensitive Hessian, alongside adaptive particle control that maintains sufficient density within the narrow band. We also develop a hybrid particle-grid quasi-Newton redistancing scheme that preserves fine-scale features while enforcing the signed-distance property. Benchmark comparisons in 2D and 3D demonstrate that PFM-LS achieves state-of-the-art volume preservation and shape fidelity against a broad range of existing level-set methods."}

Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning."}

We first propose an interfacial treatment for solving an advection-diffusion equation with a Neumann boundary condition, and then extend it to general conjugate scalar transport with both interfacial flux and scalar jumps. A one-dimensional diffusion problem is solved to verify the present scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the present scheme in improving accuracy and unifying the governing equations in the two phases with an additional source term representing the local jump condition of the interfacial scalar flux. Then, the present scheme is further applied to fluid-solid coupled scalar diffusion and advection-diffusion problems with the scalar and its flux jumps across the interface.

However, the resulting Hessenberg matrix is generally not similar to the one produced by the standard Arnoldi process, which can lead to delays or spike-like irregularities in convergence. In this paper, we introduce a modification of the randomized Arnoldi process that restores similarity with the Hessenberg matrix generated by the standard Arnoldi process. This is accomplished by enforcing orthogonality between the last Arnoldi vector and the previously generated subspace, which requires solving only one additional least-squares problem. When applied to eigenvalue problems and matrix function evaluations, the modified randomized Arnoldi process produces approximations that are identical to those obtained with the standard Arnoldi process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is as fast as the randomized Arnoldi process and as robust as the standard Arnoldi process."}

These simulations are enabled by the 10-moment collisionless fluid solver of Gkeyll, which evolves the full pressure tensor for all species.

From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors."}

A key challenge in this setting is the potential loss of convergence order due to approximating the physical domain by a polygonal mesh. Unless boundary conditions can be accurately transferred from the true boundary to the computational one, such geometric approximation errors generally lead to suboptimal convergence. To overcome this limitation, a higher-order strategy based on polynomial reconstruction of boundary data was introduced for classical finite element methods in [28, 29] and in the finite volume context in [7, 11]. More recently, this approach was extended to discontinuous Galerkin methods in [32], leading to the DG-ROD method, which restores optimal convergence rates on polygonal approximations of domains with curved boundaries. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the DG-ROD method, establishing existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution and deriving error estimates for a two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion-reaction problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on both convex and non-convex domains. Following and extending techniques from classical finite element methods [29], we prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, the DG-ROD method achieves optimal convergence despite polygonal approximations.

Besides the theories of regularity structures and paracontrolled distributions, the technique of convex integration has emerged as a possible approach to construct a solution to such singular stochastic partial differential equations. We review recent developments in this area, and also demonstrate that an application of the convex integration technique to prove non-uniqueness seems unlikely for a particular singular stochastic partial differential equation, specifically the $Φ^{4}$ model from quantum field theory."}

In the present study, a novel treatment of a two-phase interface in the volume penalization method, a kind of immersed boundary method, for solving conjugate scalar transport with general interfacial boundary conditions is developed. We first propose an interfacial treatment for solving an advection-diffusion equation with a Neumann boundary condition, and then extend it to general conjugate scalar transport with both interfacial flux and scalar jumps. A one-dimensional diffusion problem is solved to verify the present scheme and demonstrate the advantage of the present scheme in improving accuracy and unifying the governing equations in the two phases with an additional source term representing the local jump condition of the interfacial scalar flux. Then, the present scheme is further applied to fluid-solid coupled scalar diffusion and advection-diffusion problems with the scalar and its flux jumps across the interface. The simulation results of the present scheme generally show good agreement with reference results obtained by body-fitted mesh simulations with average relative deviations less than 3.0%."}

We work in the case of one spatial dimension and apply Malliavin calculus to investigate the existence of a density for the stochastic solution $u$. In particular, we show that $u$ admits continuous paths almost surely and construct a localizing sequence through which we prove that its Malliavin derivative exists locally, and that its law is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\\bf R$, establishing thus that a density exists. A key contribution of this work is the analysis of the stochastic integral appearing in the mild formulation: we derive sharp estimates for the expectation of the $p$-th power ($p \\geq 2$) of the $L^{\\infty}(D)$-norm of this stochastic integral as well as for the integral involving the $L^{\\infty}(D)$-norm of the operator associated with the kernel appearing in the integral representation of the fractional noise, all of which are essential for this study."}

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved."}

We establish that the form-defined operator $T_g$ and the natural-domain operator $U_g$ decouple in the unbounded symbols regime: while $T_g$ is governed by linear averaging, $U_g$ is controlled by the quadratic intensity of $|g|^2$. We construct a smooth, nonnegative radial symbol $g$ satisfying the coherent-state admissibility hypothesis with bounded heat transforms for all time $t>0$; for this symbol, $T_g$ is bounded, yet $U_g$ is unbounded. This is a strictly global phenomenon: under the coherent-state hypothesis, local singularities are insufficient to cause unboundedness, leaving the ``geometry at infinity'' as the sole obstruction. Boundedness of $U_g$ is equivalent to the condition that $|g|^2 dμ$ is a Fock--Carleson measure, a condition strictly stronger than the linear average $g dμ$ governing $T_g$. Finally, regarding the gap between the known sub-critical sufficiency condition and the critical heat time, we prove that heat-flow regularity is irreversible in this context and show that bootstrapping strategies cannot resolve the gap between sufficiency and critical time."}
