Based on the HL-2A limiter discharge experiments, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and MHD instability of circular cross-section tokamak plasmas are investigated in this work. The results show that when q_0=0.95, the internal kink mode of m/n=1/1 is always unstable. The increase in plasma \\b{eta} (the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) can lead to the appearance of external kink modes. The combination of axial safety factor q_0 and edge safety factor q_a determines the equilibrium configuration of the plasma and also affects the MHD stability of the equilibrium, but its growth rate is also related to the size of \\b{eta}. Under the condition of q_a>2 and q_0 slightly greater than 1, the internal kink mode and surface kink mode can be easily stabilized. However the plasma becomes unstable again and the instability intensity increases as q_0 continues to increase when q_0 exceeds 1. As the poloidal beta (\\b{eta}_p) increases, the MHD instability develops, the equilibrium configuration of MHD elongates laterally, and the Shafranov displacement increases, which in turn has the effect on suppressing instability. Calculations have shown that the maximum \\b{eta} value imposed by the ideal MHD mode in a plasma with free boundary in tokamak experiments is proportional to the normalized current I_N (I_N=I_p (MA)/a(m)B_0 (T)), and the achievable maximum beta \\b{eta}(max) is calibrated to be 2.01I_N,i.e. \\b{eta}(max)~2.01I_N. The operational \\b{eta} limit of HL-2A circular cross-section plasma is approximately \\b{eta}_N^c~2.0. Too high a value of q_0 is not conducive to MHD stability and leads the \\b{eta} limit value to decrease.

The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

Our approach introduces a parametric family of walk-based Laplacians that naturally incorporate memory effects by excluding or downweighting backtracking trajectories, where walkers immediately revisit nodes. The framework includes: (i) walk-based Laplacians that count all traversals in the network; (ii) nonbacktracking variants that eliminate immediate reversals; and (iii) backtrack-downweighted variants that provide a continuous interpolation between these two regimes. We establish that these operators extend the definition of the standard Laplacian and also preserve some of its properties.

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paired autoencoder framework for solving inverse problems with observational inconsistencies, using learned latent space mappings to enable regularized inversion and handle partial/noisy/OOD data while maintaining physical consistency.", "motivation": "To address challenges in solving inverse problems with observational inconsistencies (partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data) while maintaining consistency with underlying physical models, which traditional methods struggle with.", "method": "Two autoencoders (one for parameter space, one for observation space) connected by learned mappings between their latent spaces.
