This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online."}

Boundary interpolation is imposed by prescribing the boundary rows and columns of the control net, while the interior control points are selected by a Dirichlet principle: for each admissible choice of Bézier basis shape parameters, we compute the unique Dirichlet-energy extremal within the corresponding GT--Bézier patch space, which yields a parameter-dependent symmetric linear system for the interior control net under standard nondegeneracy assumptions. The remaining design freedom is thereby reduced to a four-parameter optimization problem, which we solve by particle swarm optimization. Numerical experiments show that the resulting two-level procedure consistently decreases the Dirichlet energy and, in our tests, often reduces the realized surface area relative to classical Bernstein--Bézier Dirichlet patches and representative quasi-harmonic and bending-energy constructions under identical boundary control data. We further adapt the same Dirichlet-extremal methodology to a hybrid tensor-product/bilinear Coons framework, obtaining minimality-biased TB--Coons patches from sparse boundary specifications."}

Such models, widely used in the random feature method (RFM) and extreme learning machines (ELM), transform network training into a linear least-squares problem. In this paper, we conduct a numerical study of the variational (Galerkin) and collocation formulations for these linearized networks. Our numerical results reveal that, in the variational formulation, the associated linear systems are severely ill-conditioned, forming the primary computational bottleneck in scaling the neural network size, even when direct solvers are employed. In contrast, collocation methods combined with robust least-squares solvers exhibit better numerical stability and achieve higher accuracy as we increase neuron numbers. This behavior is consistently observed for both ReLU$^k$ and $\\tanh$ activations, with $\\tanh$ networks exhibiting even worse conditioning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that random sampling of the hidden layer parameters, commonly used in RFM and ELM, is not necessary for achieving high accuracy. For ReLU$^k$ activations, this follows from existing theory and is verified numerically in this paper, while for $\\tanh$ activations, we introduce two deterministic schemes that achieve comparable accuracy."}

Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \\( ν^{1/2} \\) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice."}

Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection."}

Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence."}

Error field correction coils are designed to couple to the plasma-amplified kink that dominates the drive of core resonances.

Additionally, the fluid is subject to a fixed, but arbitrarily selected, forcing data profile with variable amplitude. We use the Riemann mapping to equivalently reformulate the resulting two-dimensional free boundary problem as a single one-dimensional fully nonlinear pseudodifferential equation for a function describing the domain's geometry. By discovering a hidden ellipticity in the reformulated equation, we are able to import a global implicit function theorem to construct a connected set of traveling waves, containing both the quiescent solution and large amplitude members. We find that either solutions continue to exist for arbitrarily large data amplitude or else one of a finite number of meaningful breakdown scenarios must occur.

The absolute atom densities and translational temperatures were determined over a range of pressures and RF power . At pressures of 267 Pa and above, the O atom mole fraction increases with RF power and decreases with pressure, reaching a maximum of 15 percent. However, at 133 and 67 Pa it passes through a distinct maximum with power before decreasing significantly. The atom recombination processes are probed by time resolved measurements in the afterglow of pulse modulated plasmas. At 133 and 67 Pa the atom loss is dominated by surface recombination, and we see clear evidence that this rate is increased by energetic ion bombardment, in agreement with a study from Bill Graham group. This effect partially explains the observed decrease in dissociation at high RF power. The time-resolved results also allow the O negative ion density to be determined and indicate the creation of ozone in the afterglow. At 133 Pa, the trends with RF power of the O2 dissociation, O negative ion density and gas temperature suggest a transition at high power to a plasma mode with fewer high energy electrons. At higher pressures gas phase recombination mechanisms become dominant, however gas convection driven by gas cooling in the afterglow makes it complex to analyse the time-resolved data."}

These transitions are quantitatively characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent computed via the Wolf algorithm and supported by Poincaré sections and time-series analysis.

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

EMEC instability", "categories": ["physics.plasm-ph", "astro-ph.SR"], "comment": "10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $κ$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $κ$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $κ$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\\perp/T_\\parallel > 1$ ($\\parallel, \\perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $κ$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $κ$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $κ$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $κ$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons."}

The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space.

Indeed, $Δ_g^2 + λ_2 Δ_g$ does the job, where $Δ_g:=div_g \\nabla_g$. and where $λ_2$ is the second lowest eigenvalue of the operator $-Δ_g$. The question that remains is how rare are elliptic differential operators whose lowest eigenvalue has this property. In this paper, the author proves that elliptic operators of the form $Δ_g^2 - div_g(T-λ_2 g^{-1}) d$, where $T$ is a negative semi-definite $(2,0)$-tensor field on $M$, and where $g^{-1}$ is the inverse metric tensor, have the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.

Error analyses show that both integrators achieve their optimal convergence orders in the energy space under significantly relaxed regularity assumptions. Furthermore, the symmetry property ensures that the convergence order of a first-order symmetric scheme improves as the regularity of the exact solution increases. A numerical experiment demonstrates that the proposed second-order symmetric scheme nearly preserves the system energy over extended periods."}

For gratings, finite coherence simultaneously lowers Bragg-peak heights and broadens their widths, whereas for isolated steps only the overall scaling with q affected. We map the parameter space relevant to current SASE and self-seeded XFELs, revealing that Doppler effects remain managable for the trieval of geometry parameters (less than few 10 % error) for SASE bandwidths but become the dominant error source in seeded configurations or above-keV temperatures. Practical consequences for density-gradient retrieval and interface-sharpness measurements are quantified. The results supply clear criteria for when Doppler broadening must be included in SAXS data analysis and offer a route to infer electron temperature directly from coherence-loss signatures."}

Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable."}

The invariant density satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We reformulate this equation in terms of its score function (the gradient of the log-density), which is estimated directly from data via denoising score matching, thereby bypassing explicit density estimation. This learned score is then embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct the drift velocity field under the resulting score-based FP equation. The mesh-free nature of PINNs allows the framework to scale to higher dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in mesh-based methods. To address the ill-posedness of high-dimensional inverse problems, we recast the problem as a PDE-constrained optimization that seeks the minimal-energy velocity field. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this problem admits a unique solution that depends continuously on the score function. The constrained formulation is solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments on representative dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, an active swimmer in an anharmonic trap, and the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems, demonstrate that PINN-IMSM accurately recovers invariant measures and reconstructs faithful dynamical behavior for problems in up to five dimensions."}

Despite their attractive properties, QP fields are not amenable to the near-axis expansion, a major theoretical tool for understanding toroidal fields. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for defining and understanding QP flux surfaces. This framework relies on a simplification that transforms the task of finding a quasi-poloidal flux surface from a 3D problem to a 2D problem. This simplification also applies to asymmetric magnetic mirrors with desirable properties. We sketch how this 2D problem can form the basis of an efficient optimisation problem for finding QP flux surfaces. We leverage this 2D problem for theoretical understanding: for instance, we identify one class of QP flux surfaces that are naturally flat mirrors (Velasco et al. 2023). The reduced model is validated against numerically optimised QP equilibria. We further utilise the reduced model to explain the prevalence of cusps, high mirror ratios, and narrow pinch points in these numerical equilibria."}

This paper aims to tackle this problem within the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved deterministically in an outer loop and macroscopic synthetic equations are solved in an inner loop. To avoid kinetic-macroscopic boundary-flux mismatch and the resulting convergence bottlenecks, for the macroscopic boundary flux at every inner iteration, the incident increment is estimated using a Maxwellian distribution, and then the reflected contribution is obtained by boundary conditions consistent with those in the kinetic solver. In addition to retaining the fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, the proposed method significantly reduces the iterations required to determine the wall-reflected gas parameters. Numerical simulations of rarefied gas flows in and around a 3D nozzle, a 2D adiabatic cylinder, and a 2D annular heat-transfer configuration show good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, while achieving substantial efficiency gains over conventional iterative schemes."}

In fact, the set $E$ has full measure inside a cube where the construction is supported. Moreover, we also construct a divergence-free velocity field $v \\in C_{t}C^ω_x$ for which the associated continuity equation admits two distinct solutions $μ^1$ and $μ^2$ which are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost every time, and start from the same initial datum $\\bar μ\\ll \\mathscr{L}^{d}$.

This is crucial to cover the whole class of non-Osgood moduli of continuity.

Moreover, this approach preserves the original energy exactly at both the continuous and discrete levels, as opposed to a modified energy preserved by the auxiliary variable methods. Rigorous proofs are provided for the energy conservation and numerical accuracy of all derived schemes. The trade-off for these advantages is the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the Lagrange multiplier. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that the associated computational cost is generally not dominant, indicating that the new schemes retain computational efficiency comparable to the auxiliary variable-based schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed schemes."}

We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfvén ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation."}

The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs.

Surfactants alter two-phase flow by modifying interfacial tension and wettability, while two-phase flow controls surfactant transport pathways and interfacial adsorption. These coupled processes are commonly modeled using Darcy-type two-phase flow equations combined with advection--dispersion--adsorption transport equations, with capillary pressure--saturation relationships scaled by the Leverett $J$-function. However, the Leverett $J$-function idealizes porous media as bundles of cylindrical tubes and decouples interfacial tension and wettability, limiting its ability to represent angular pore geometries and interfacial tension--wettability coupling effects. We present a modeling framework that explicitly incorporates pore angularity and interfacial tension--wettability coupling into Darcy-scale surfactant-laden flow and transport models. Two-phase flow properties are derived for angular pores, upscaled across pore size distributions, and formulated as explicit and closed-form expressions. These upscaled relationships are integrated into a coupled flow--transport model to simulate transient two-phase flow and surfactant transport. Results reveal a nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependence of two-phase flow properties on pore angularity, pore size distribution, and interfacial tension. Example simulations of water flow and PFAS migration in unsaturated soils indicate that surfactant-induced flow effects on PFAS leaching are generally minor under typical conditions, whereas pore angularity strongly controls water flow, interfacial area, and PFAS retention. Overall, the proposed framework provides a more physically grounded approach for modeling two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media."}

Toward this end, we delineate two broad classes of strategies for general higher-order time discretizations which we term spatial and temporal strategies. We provide a description of these two strategies and develop fourth-order time accurate schemes in the context of our Maxwell's system. However, our description can be used to prescribe similar fourth- or even higher-order time-integration methods for any linear (or quasi-linear) system of time-dependent partial differential equations. Our organizing principle in our proposed two strategies is to Taylor expand the unknown solution in time by assuming sufficient regularity. Then, in the spatial strategy, we use Maxwell's equations themselves to replace the fourth-order time derivatives in an appropriately truncated Taylor expansion with corresponding higher-order spatial derivatives. On the other hand, in the temporal strategy, we simply use higher-order finite difference schemes for the various higher-order time derivative terms in the truncated Taylor approximation. In both cases, we then defer to a standard finite element exterior calculus manner of compatible discretization for the spatial component of the Maxwell's solution. For our proposed schemes corresponding to the two strategies, we show that they are both stable and convergent and provide some validating numerical examples in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main contributions are in the development of the fourth-order time discretization methods that are energy conserving using our two outlined strategies and proofs of their convergence for semi- and full-discretizations of our three-field system of Maxwell's equations."}

Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li."}

This work is motivated by applications in model order reduction (MOR) of switched linear systems (SLS) in control form, where GLEs play a central role. We analyze how inaccuracies in the numerical solution of GLEs propagate through the MOR procedure and affect the accuracy and reliability of the reduced order model. Furthermore, the classical balanced-truncation error estimate for SLS is neither theoretically nor practically viable, as they rely on restrictive assumptions requiring several requiring several linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to be satisfied exactly by numerically computed solutions of the GLEs. To overcome these limitation, we propose a new MOR framework for SLS, called piecewise balanced reduction (PBR). The method is based on solving multiple GLEs and the construction of projection matrices that are piecewise constant in time to appropriately balance and subsequently reduce the SLS. We extend the standard balanced-truncation error bounds and demonstrate that the PBR formulation allows us to control the error arising from the inexact LMI. In addition, our new error bound accounts for the influence of the piecewise constant time-varying projection matrices. Altogether, this renders the PBR approach for SLS applicable to a broad and flexible class of SLS. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our theoretical results."}

Here, we develop a unified multifractal framework that jointly prescribes longitudinal and transverse velocity increments, and extends to gradients. We derive explicit relations linking inertial-range scaling exponents of structure functions to moments of velocity gradients in dissipation range. Our results reveal that longitudinal gradient scaling is solely prescribed by longitudinal structure functions, as traditionally expected; however, transverse gradient scaling is prescribed by mixed longitudinal-transverse structure functions. Validation with high-resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence, at Taylor-scale Reynolds number up to $1300$ demonstrates excellent agreement, paving way for a more complete and predictive description of intermittency faithful to the underlying turbulence dynamics."}

The approach is based on a prior-informed, dimension-reduced Kalman filter with smoothing. While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework.

In the present work, we extend SINDy to identify distributed-delay differential equations by incorporating the Linear Chain Trick (LCT), which provides a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation representing the distributed memory effects. Hence, SINDy can operate in an augmented state space using conventional sparse regression while preserving a clear interpretation of delayed influences via the chain trick. From time-series data, the proposed method jointly infers the governing equations, the mean delay, and the dispersion of the underlying delay distribution. We numerically verify the method on several models with distributed delay, including the logistic growth model and a Hes1--mRNA gene regulatory network model.

Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals."}

The first one is when one scaling is much larger than the others. In this case, one bubble does not concentrate (hence stabilize) and the other bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-2/(N-6)}$ together with strong sign constraints. Next, assuming we are not in the first scenario, we establish a non-degenerate condition on the positions of bubbles to obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-4)}$. The last case we consider is a degenerate, but not too much degenerate, scenario. Here again, we obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-3)}$.

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling.

On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems."}

In cases where the Kolmogorov $N$-width decays fast enough, it is effective to approximate the solution as a sum of $N$ separable terms, each being the product of a parameter-dependent coefficient and a space-dependent function. This leads to reduced-order models with $N$ degrees of freedom and complexity of order ${\\mathcal O}(N^3)$.\n  However, when the $N$-width decays slowly, $N$ must be large to achieve acceptable accuracy, making cubic complexity prohibitive. The linear complexity measure in terms of Kolmogorov width must be replaced by the Gelfand width, with its associated sensing number. Recent nonlinear approaches based on this notion decompose the $N$ coordinates into two groups: $n$ free variables and $\\overline{n}$ dependent variables, where the latter are nonlinear functions of the former ($N= n+\\overline n$). Several works have focused on cases where these $\\overline{n}$ functions are homogeneous quadratic forms of the $n$ variables, with optimization strategies for choosing $n$ given a target accuracy.\n  A rigorous analysis of the local sensing number is carried out, showing that $n = p$ is optimal and appropriate, at least locally, around a reference point. In practical scenarios involving wide parameter ranges, the condition $p\\le n \\le p + k$ (with $k$ small) is valid and more robust from continuity arguments. Additionally, the assumption of a quadratic mapping, while justified in a local sense, becomes insufficient. More expressive nonlinear mappings-including those using machine learning-become necessary. This work contributes a theoretical foundation for such strategies and highlights the need for further investigations to push back the Kolmogorov Barrier."}

The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp."}

The metric is introduced through a dynamic formulation that combines transport and source costs along solutions of a nonconservative continuity equation, where mass variation is constrained to occur along a fixed strictly positive reference direction. We show that geodesics associated with this metric exhibit a non-locality property: almost every time, they are supported on the whole state space, independently of the choice of endpoints. Moreover, along optimal curves, the source term displays a characteristic temporal profile, with mass creation occurring at early times and subsequent decay as the curve approaches the target measure. As an application of this property, we compare our metric with the shift-transport distance and prove that the latter is always bounded above by our metric. Finally, we establish a Kantorovich-type duality formula in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi subsolutions, which provides a characterization of the metric and highlights the role of the momentum associated with geodesic curves."}

Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics.

A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value.

Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques.

In our first result, we prove the following quantitative bound under the assumption that the $\\mathbb{M}^N$ is a Riemannian model satisfying the centered isoperimetric inequality: We prove that $$ \\|\\nabla_g u\\|^2_{L^{2}(\\mathbb{M}^N)} - \\frac{(N-2)^2}{4}\\left\\|\\frac{u}{r(x)}\\right\\|^2_{L^2(\\mathbb{M}^N)} \\geq C [\\mbox{dist}(u, Z)]^{\\frac{4N}{N-2}}\\left\\|\\frac{u}{r(x)}\\right\\|^2_{L^2(\\mathbb{M}^N)},$$ for every real-valued weakly differentiable function $u$ on $\\mathbb{M}^N$ such that $|\\nabla_g u| \\in L^2(\\mathbb{M}^N)$ and $u$ decays to zero at infinity. Here $r(x) = d_g(x,x_0)$ denotes the geodesic distance from a fixed pole $x_0,$ the set $Z$ represents the family of virtual extremals, and the distance is understood in an appropriate generalized Lorentz-type space. Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Linéaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting. Finally, we establish a quantitative correspondence between the Hardy deficit on the manifold and an appropriate weighted Hardy deficit in Euclidean space, showing that each controls the other."}

While statistical LPR analysis focuses on overcoming sampling noise under probabilistic assumptions, the deterministic MLS theory studies smoothness properties and convergence rates with respect to the \\textit{fill-distance} (a resolution parameter). Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \\textit{separation} $δ_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample.

Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples. This work provides the first unified stochastic analysis of MLS, demonstrating that -- despite the failure of deterministic sampling assumptions -- the classical convergence and smoothness properties persist under natural probabilistic models"}

With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects.

We provide numerical experiments to test the resolution and robustness of the Born approximation in different situations.

However, the mechanistic pathways underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that pattern formation in fish development requires specific pigment cell interactions. Motivated by experimental observations of pigmentation alterations following contaminant exposure, we investigate how pollutants influence pigment cell self-organization using a continuum reaction-diffusion-advection framework. The model incorporates nonlocal Morse-type kernels to describe short- and long-range interactions among melanophores and xanthophores. Our results show that perturbations to the strengths of adhesion or repulsion can drive transitions between stripes, spots, and mixed patterns, reproducing phenotypes characteristic of fish pigmentation mutants. In particular, homotypic interactions are sensitive to contamination, leading to pronounced changes in melanophore density and resulting pigmentation patterns. Time-dependent simulations indicate that pigment changes from early short-term contaminant exposure may be recoverable, whereas prolonged exposure can lead to sustained pigment loss. In a growing fish, contaminant-induced changes in cell-cell interactions directly influence stripe formation rate, stripe number, and pigmentation levels. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanistic link between experimentally observed pigmentation alterations and the changes in spatial patterns of adult fish."}
