Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side. In contrast, the (flow) field provided by the finite difference mesh is mapped by higher-order B-Splines or a Lagrangian function. Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy. This behaviour is universal for smooth or strongly oscillating field quantities, which will be shown in a comparative study between the Lighthill-like source term and the source term of the perturbed convective wave equation for subsonic flows."}

Like all particle methods, the FP method is inherently stochastic, which leads to statistical fluctuations in macroscopic quantities and necessitates large particle numbers for accurate results. In this work, we investigate the use of quasi-random numbers, which sample distributions more evenly and thereby reduce the variance. To preserve the low-discrepancy structure across time steps, we employ the Array Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (Array-RQMC) technique. We combine the FP method with Array-RQMC and compare it in homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems with other commonly used variance-reduction techniques. The proposed FP-Array-RQMC approach achieves improved convergence rates compared with pseudo-random sampling and yields smaller estimator errors for sufficiently large particle numbers."}

We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error.

Current implementations of molecular dynamics simulation coupled with multi-scale electrodynamics (ED) and heat conduction (HC) in FEcMD program are advanced mainly in the two aspects as follows. In electrodynamics, the FEcMD program incorporates the space charge interactions (space charge potential and exchange-correlation effects) in the self-consistent solved Poisson-Schrödinger equation with Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation to evaluate the field emission current density and the related resistive heating process more reliably for nanowires or nano-protrusions especially for nano-gaps between two metal electrodes.

Using the STRIPE modeling framework-which integrates SOLPS-ITER, COMSOL, RustBCA, and GITR/GITRm-we simulate carbon erosion, re-deposition, and global impurity transport in two H-mode discharges with varying antenna--plasma gaps and RF powers. COMSOL predicts rectified sheath potentials of 1-5 kV, localized near the bottom of the antenna where magnetic field lines intersect at grazing angles. Erosion is dominated by carbon self-sputtering, with RF-accelerated D+ ions contributing up to 1 % of the total erosion flux. GITRm simulations show that in the small-gap case, only ~ 13 % of eroded carbon is re-deposited locally, with 58 % transported into the core. In contrast, the large-gap case exhibits lower total erosion, along with reduced core penetration (~ 35 %) and weaker re-deposition (~ 4 %), consistent with lower collisionality and limited plasma contact. The simulation trends are consistent with experimental observations, which have not shown elevated core impurity levels during helicon operation in the present graphite-wall configuration. However, under certain plasma conditions and magnetic configurations, the helicon antenna may still act as a finite source of net erosion and core-directed impurity transport, potentially influencing the overall core impurity balance. These findings emphasize the need for sheath-aware antenna designs and predictive impurity transport modeling to support future high-power RF systems with high-Z first wall materials in fusion devices."}

We introduce modal-centric field inversion (MCFI), a paradigm that reformulates inverse problems in the reduced space of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes rather than the full physical state space. By targeting dominant flow structures instead of point-wise field values, MCFI provides a compact, physically meaningful objective that naturally regularizes the inversion and dramatically reduces computational burden. Central to this framework is the differentiable POD: an adjoint-based method that efficiently computes sensitivities of POD modes with respect to model parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization in the modal space. We demonstrate MCFI on a one and two-dimensional modified viscous Burger's equation, optimizing spatially varying coefficients to match target dynamics through mode-matching. The adjoint formulation achieves computational cost independent of parameter dimension, in contrast to finite-difference approaches that scale linearly. MCFI establishes a foundation for scalable inverse design and model calibration in unsteady, high-dimensional systems."}

In this work, a stellarator magnetic configuration is presented that satisfies the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equation and that achieves unprecedented levels of piecewise omnigenity.

Using analytical scalings supported by quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations including QED effects, we demonstrate that a laser pulse with power as low as 2 PW is sufficient to reach the quantum regime characterized by $χ_e> 1$ .

A method is presented for solving nonclassical symmetric systems of two polynomial equations that change places when the unknowns are permuted. We study polynomial equations containing the second iteration of a given polynomial, which are reduced to nonclassical symmetric systems of equations. New higher-degree polynomial equations containing free parameters that admit solutions in radicals are found.

Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting.

The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF.

A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{é} operators, and of Calder{ó}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension."}

While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $α= 1/\\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\\mathcal{V} \\geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints."}

While KdV and the gauged equation are equivalent for smooth solutions, the latter is better behaved at low regularity in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. In particular, the admissible regularities go beyond the $H^{-1}$-scale, which is a well-known threshold for KdV. As a byproduct, by reversing the gauge transform, we are able to improve on the known theory for KdV and derive sharp local well-posedness in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces with large integrability exponent. Our strategy is based on an infinite normal form reduction and Fourier restriction estimates, together with a thorough exploitation of algebraic cancellations. Additionally, our method is totally independent of the KdV completely integrable structure, and extends to other non-integrable models with quadratic nonlinearities."}

We show that solutions to these equations have a partial regularity estimate which captures differences of the solution up to the scale at which the kernel has a truncation in its singularity. The estimates we provide are robust with respect to the truncation parameter, and they include the existing results for the original operators without truncation. There are some earlier results for linear and elliptic cases of this situation of integrable interaction kernels, and so our work is a generalization of those to the nonlinear and parabolic setting."}

The foundation of this theory was laid by E. De Giorgi's groundbreaking resolution of Hilbert's nineteenth problem in 1956. The innovative tools he developed to tackle this problem proved to be remarkably versatile. In 1957, just one year later, J. Nash independently developed analogous techniques for parabolic equations, concurrently with De Giorgi's research. By the year 2000, these techniques had been extended to address elliptic and parabolic equations featuring integral diffusion, such as the fractional Laplacian. More recently, the theory has evolved to encompass kinetic equations, accommodating both local and integral diffusions. This book aims to present these results in a unified and coherent manner, beginning with the classical elliptic framework and progressing through to the most recent advancements in kinetic equations."}

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data."}
