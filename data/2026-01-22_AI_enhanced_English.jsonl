Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side.

Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy.

In particular, when the Laplacian term is absent, no mild solution exists, whereas for $\u03bb>0$ the admissible regimes depend critically on $(\u03b1,N)$, extending and sharpening the known results for purely local fractional stochastic heat equations.

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.", "AI": {"tldr": "A unifying framework for physics-aware learning methods for PDEs, analyzing PINNs and neural operators through three dimensions: what is learned, how physics is integrated, and computational amortization.", "motivation": "The field lacks a unified perspective to understand relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles of various physics-aware data-driven approaches in scientific workflows, despite their increasing importance in modern scientific modeling.", "method": "Proposes a unifying perspective organized around three fundamental dimensions: 1) what is learned (model vs. solution), 2) how physical structures are integrated into learning (constraints vs. inductive biases), and 3) how computational load is amortized across problem instances.", "result": "Provides a shared design space that places Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs) within a unified framework, enabling systematic analysis of existing methods and their structural properties.", "conclusion": "This unifying view helps understand challenges as consequences of structural properties of learning PDEs, aims to facilitate development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers, and catalyzes synthesis of physics and data in scientific workflows."}}
