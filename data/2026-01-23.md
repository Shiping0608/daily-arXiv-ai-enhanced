### [1] [Efficient Numerical Reconstruction of Wave Equation Sources via Droplet-Induced Asymptotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15787)
*Shutong Hou,Mourad Sini,Haibing Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Novel method for 3D acoustic wave inverse source problem using high-contrast droplet injection and single-point measurements, enabling stable reconstructions where conventional approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches to the inverse source problem for acoustic wave equations suffer from ill-posedness and require extensive spatial measurements. There's a need for stable reconstruction methods that work with limited measurement data, particularly for applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing.

Method: Inject a small high-contrast droplet into the medium and measure wave field perturbation at a single external point over time. Use asymptotic expansion from existing theory with Newtonian operator eigensystem, solve time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation, reconstruct source via Riesz basis expansions and mollification-based numerical differentiations.

Result: Method enables stable source reconstructions with only single-point measurements. 3D numerical experiments demonstrate accurate source recovery under noise (SNR ~ 1/a), with error analysis for droplet size (order a) and number of spectral modes N.

Conclusion: The approach successfully overcomes traditional limitations of inverse source problems by using droplet-induced perturbations and single-point measurements, providing a practical solution for applications where conventional methods fail due to ill-posedness and data limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and numerically implement a novel approach for solving the inverse source problem of the acoustic wave equation in three dimensions. By injecting a small high-contrast droplet into the medium, we exploit the resulting wave field perturbation measured at a single external point over time. The method enables stable source reconstructions where conventional approaches fail due to ill-posedness, with potential applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing. Key contributions include:
  1. Implementation of a theoretically justified asymptotic expansion, from [33], using the eigensystem of the Newtonian operator, with error analysis for the spectral truncation.
  2. Novel numerical schemes for solving the time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation and reconstructing the source via Riesz basis expansions and mollification-based numerical differentiations.
  3. Reconstruction requiring only single-point measurements, overcoming traditional spatial data limitations.
  4. 3D numerical experiments demonstrating accurate source recovery under noise (SNR of the order $1/a$), with error analysis for the droplet size (of the order $a$) and the number of spectral modes $N$.

*Miguel A. Piñar*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are applied as a spectral method tool for solving boundary-value problems of stationary Schrödinger equations on the unit ball.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials can serve as an effective tool within spectral methods for solving boundary-value problems, particularly for stationary Schrödinger equations on the unit ball.

Method: Using a variational formulation where Sobolev inner products naturally arise, constructing a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials satisfying boundary conditions, expressed in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, and establishing connection formulas with classical orthogonal polynomials.

Result: A basis of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials is developed, connection formulas with classical orthogonal polynomials are established, Sobolev Fourier coefficients are recursively derived, and one numerical experiment is presented.

Conclusion: Sobolev orthogonal polynomials provide a useful framework for spectral methods in solving boundary-value problems, with practical implementation demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Abstract: Our main objective in this work is to show how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials emerge as a useful tool within the framework of spectral methods for boundary-value problems. The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schrödinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.

### [3] [Canonical structure of the LLG equation for exponential updates in micromagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16122)
*Jörg Schröder,Maximilian Vorwerk*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Proposes an exponential update algorithm for magnetic moments in micromagnetics that preserves the unit length constraint of magnetization vectors through geometric integration on spheres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a canonical structure for exponential update algorithms in micromagnetism that properly handles the geometric constraints of magnetization vectors, addressing the lack of established canonical formulations despite existing geometric structures.

Method: Uses tensor algebraic reformulations of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to create canonical representations, then derives an efficient update scheme based on the specific structure of exponentials of skew-symmetric matrices for geometric integration on spheres.

Result: The proposed exponential update algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in representative examples, effectively maintaining the unit length constraint while providing efficient computational updates.

Conclusion: The exponential update algorithm provides a geometrically consistent and efficient approach for micromagnetics simulations, offering a canonical structure for exponential integration that preserves the physical constraints of magnetization vectors.

Abstract: In this contribution we propose an exponential update algorithm for magnetic moments appearing in the framework of micromagnetics and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. This algorithm can be interpreted as the geometric integration on spheres, that a priori satisfy the unit length constraint of the normalized magnetization vector. Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators. Based on the specific structure of the exponential of skew symmetric matrices an efficient update scheme is derived. The excellent performance of the proposed exponential update algorithm is demonstrated in representative examples.

### [4] [A hybrid reconstruction of piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16124)
*Guohui Song,Congzhi Xia*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining non-uniform filter reconstruction with stable extrapolation achieves exponential accuracy for piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data, overcoming Gibbs phenomenon near discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data is challenging due to Gibbs phenomenon near jump discontinuities, which causes slower convergence rates in those regions.

Method: Extends filter method to non-uniform Fourier data using admissible frames, then combines it with a stable extrapolation method to recover function values near jump discontinuities.

Result: The non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from jumps but slowly near discontinuities; the hybrid method achieves exponential accuracy uniformly across the entire domain.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid method successfully overcomes Gibbs phenomenon limitations and achieves uniform exponential accuracy for reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from their non-uniform Fourier data. We first extend the filter method for uniform Fourier data to the non-uniform setting by using the techniques of admissible frames. We show that the proposed non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from the jump discontinuities. However, the convergence rate is significantly slower near the jump discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon. To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities. We show that the proposed hybrid method could achieve exponential accuracy uniformly on the entire domain. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

### [5] [Existence and uniqueness of $L^1$-solutions to time-fractional nonlinear diffusion equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15618)
*Mikiya Kametaka,Tatsuki Kawakami*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Global existence, uniqueness, and mass conservation for L¹-solutions to time-fractional porous medium and fast diffusion equations, with proof that finite-time extinction doesn't occur.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: Time-fractional nonlinear diffusion equations exhibit fundamentally different behavior from classical counterparts, with guaranteed global existence, uniqueness, and absence of finite-time extinction phenomena for L¹-solutions, providing important theoretical insights into fractional diffusion processes.

Abstract: We establish the global existence and uniqueness of $L^1$-solutions to the Cauchy problem for time-fractional porous medium type nonlinear diffusion equations. Furthermore, we give the mass conservation law for $L^1$-solutions to time-fractional fast diffusion equations, and prove that the finite-time extinction does not occur for any nonnegative $L^1$-solutions.

### [6] [Linear stability of the first bifurcation in a tumor growth free boundary problem via local bifurcation structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15647)
*Junying Chen,Ruixiang Xing*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linear stability of bifurcation solutions in a 3D tumor growth model with Robin boundary conditions, showing that radially symmetric stationary solutions become unstable under non-radially symmetric perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed existence of stationary bifurcation solutions for tumor growth models, but their stability analysis was challenging due to lack of explicit expressions and high-dimensional kernel of linearized operators.

Method: Uses bifurcation curve structure to overcome difficulties in stability analysis, specifically analyzing the transcritical bifurcation at μ₂ and examining linear stability under non-radially symmetric perturbations.

Result: The bifurcation curve (r₂(ε), μ₂(ε)) exhibits transcritical bifurcation with μ₂'(0)<0, and the stationary bifurcation solution (σ₂(ε), p₂(ε), r₂(ε)) is linearly unstable for small |ε| under non-radially symmetric perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully analyzes linear stability of bifurcation solutions using novel approach based on bifurcation curve structure, overcoming challenges posed by eight-dimensional generalized kernel and lack of explicit solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a 3-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth with the Robin boundary condition. The system involves a positive parameter $μ$ which reflects the intensity of tumor aggressiveness. Huang, Zhang and Hu [Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl. 2017(35), 483-502] have shown that for each $μ_n$ ($n$ even) in a strictly increasing sequence $\{ μ_n \}(n\geq 2)$, there exists a stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_n(\varepsilon),p_n(\varepsilon),r_n(\varepsilon))$ with $μ= μ_n(\varepsilon)$ bifurcating from $μ_n$. We first derive that the bifurcation curve $(r_2(\varepsilon),μ_2(\varepsilon))$ exhibits a transcritical bifurcation with $μ_2'(0)<0$. Moreover, we show that the stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_2(\varepsilon),p_2(\varepsilon),r_2(\varepsilon))$ is linearly unstable for small $|\varepsilon|$ under non-radially symmetric perturbations. In contrast to the linear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, the lack of explicit expressions for bifurcation solutions adds great difficulty in analyzing their linear stability. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of the bifurcation curve's structure to overcome the above difficulties. Moreover, this linear stability result is not established using the standard method, due to an eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 for the linearized operator.

### [7] [Local smoothing estimates for bilinear Fourier integral operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15667)
*Duván Cardona*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper formulates a bilinear local smoothing conjecture for Fourier integral operators, shows it follows from the linear case, and establishes results in 2D with partial progress in higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the celebrated linear local smoothing theory for Fourier integral operators (due to Sogge) to the bilinear setting, creating a unified framework that connects linear and bilinear smoothing phenomena.

Method: Formulates a bilinear smoothing conjecture derived from Sogge's linear case, shows the linear conjecture implies the bilinear version, uses recent progress on linear smoothing to establish results in 2D, and develops methods for higher dimensions.

Result: Proves bilinear local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension d=2, makes partial progress for d≥3, and shows the bilinear conjecture holds for all odd dimensions d.

Conclusion: The bilinear local smoothing conjecture is established as a natural extension of linear theory, with complete results in 2D and odd dimensions, providing a bridge between linear and multilinear harmonic analysis.

Abstract: We formulate a local smoothing conjecture for bilinear Fourier integral operators in every dimension $d \ge 2,$ derived from the celebrated linear case due to Sogge, which we refer to as the \emph{bilinear smoothing conjecture}. We show that the linear local smoothing conjecture implies this bilinear version. As a consequence of our approach and due to the recent progress on the subject, we establish local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension $d=2,$ that is, on $\mathbb{R}^2_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$. Also, a partial progress is presented for the high-dimensional case $d\geq 3.$ In particular, our method allows us to deduce that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions $d$.

### [8] [Global regularity for the Navier-Stokes equations with application to global solvability for the Euler equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15685)
*Myong-Hwan Ri*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves that Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the 3D+ Navier-Stokes equations with initial data in H^s (s ≥ -1 + d/2) are globally regular and belong to L^∞(0,∞; H^s).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish global regularity for Leray-Hopf weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with initial data in certain Sobolev spaces, addressing a fundamental open problem in fluid dynamics.

Method: 1. Construct a supercritical space with sparse inverse logarithmic weight in frequency domain. 2. Obtain energy estimates for high frequency parts involving this supercritical norm. 3. Superpose energy norms of high frequency parts to get viscosity-independent estimates via re-scaling argument.

Result: Any Leray-Hopf weak solution with initial data u₀ ∈ H^s(ℝ^d), s ≥ -1 + d/2, belongs to L^∞(0,∞; H^s(ℝ^d)) and is globally regular for d ≥ 3.

Conclusion: The paper establishes global regularity for Navier-Stokes equations in dimensions d ≥ 3 for initial data in Sobolev spaces H^s with s ≥ -1 + d/2, using novel supercritical spaces and re-scaling techniques.

Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to the $d$-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations $(d\geq 3)$ with initial values $u_0\in H^{s}(\mathbb R^d)$, $s\geq -1+\frac{d}{2}$, belongs to $L^\infty(0,\infty; H^{s}(\mathbb R^d))$ and thus it is globally regular. For the proof, first, we construct a supercritical space which has very sparse inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain, compared to the critical homogeneous Sobolev $\dot{H}^{-1+d/2}$-norm. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm as a factor of the upper bounds. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical and subcritical norms independent of the viscosity coefficient for the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.

### [9] [Riemann-Hilbert approach for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a step-like oscillating background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15841)
*Yan Rybalko*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper develops Riemann-Hilbert formalism for the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, focusing on pure oscillating step initial data, and derives three families of two-soliton solutions based on parameter relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, where the solution approaches zero at negative infinity and an oscillatory function at positive infinity, which represents a challenging nonlocal boundary value problem.

Method: Develops Riemann-Hilbert formalism for this problem, with particular attention to the pure oscillating step initial data case where u(x,0)=0 for x<0 and u(x,0)=Acos(2Bx) for x≥0.

Result: Derives three new families of two-soliton solutions corresponding to different parameter regimes: B < A/4, B > A/4, and B = A/4, establishing the relationship between boundary condition parameters and soliton behavior.

Conclusion: The Riemann-Hilbert approach successfully handles the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, revealing distinct two-soliton solution families depending on the relationship between oscillation amplitude A and frequency parameter B.

Abstract: This work focuses on the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ u_t(x,t)+6u(x,t)u(-x,-t)u_x(x,t)+u_{xxx}(x,t)=0, $$ with the oscillating step-like boundary conditions: $u(x,t)\to 0$ as $x\to-\infty$ and $u(x,t)\backsimeq A\cos(2Bx+8B^3t)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $A,B>0$ are arbitrary constants. The main goal is to develop the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for this problem, paying a particular attention to the case of the ``pure oscillating step'' initial data, that is $u(x,0)=0$ for $x<0$ and $u(x,0)=A\cos(2Bx)$ for $x\geq0$. Also, we derive three new families of two-soliton solutions, which correspond to the values of $A$ and $B$ satisfying $B<\frac{A}{4}$, $B>\frac{A}{4}$, and $B=\frac{A}{4}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work [8] established quantitative Borg-Levinson theorem for Schrödinger operator with unbounded potential. This paper aims to extend those results to the more complex magnetic Schrödinger operator, covering both isotropic and anisotropic cases.

Method: Extends the quantitative Borg-Levinson theorem framework to magnetic Schrödinger operator. Analyzes both isotropic and anisotropic cases, establishing stability estimates for inverse problems.

### [11] [Recovery of nonlinear material parameters in a quasilinear Lamé system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15881)
*David Johansson,Yavar Kian*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Unique and stable recovery of nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary stress measurements using prescribed boundary displacements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inverse problem of determining nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary measurements, which is important for material characterization and non-destructive testing in engineering applications.

Method: Analyze quasilinear Lamé systems with space-independent elastic tensors. Use asymptotic expansions of boundary stress and tensorial calculus. Boundary measurements taken at finite points (single point for isotropic case) with explicit class of affine boundary displacement functions.

Result: Prove unique and stable recovery of wide class of space-independent nonlinear elastic tensors, including identification of two nonlinear isotropic Lamé moduli and certain anisotropic tensors.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical foundations for determining nonlinear elastic parameters from limited boundary measurements, with practical implications for material characterization using minimal experimental data.

Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of determining nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary stress measurements corresponding to prescribed boundary displacements. The material law is described by a nonlinear, space-independent elastic tensor depending on both the displacement and the strain, and gives rise to a general class of quasilinear Lamé systems. We prove the unique and stable recovery of a wide class of space-independent nonlinear elastic tensors, including the identification of two nonlinear isotropic Lamé moduli as well as certain anisotropic tensors. The boundary measurements are assumed to be available at a finite number of boundary points and, in the isotropic case, at a single point. Moreover, the measurements are generated by boundary displacements belonging to an explicit class of affine functions. The analysis is based on structural properties of nonlinear Lamé systems, including asymptotic expansions of the boundary stress and tensorial calculus.

### [12] [Convergence to shock profiles for Burgers equation with singular fast-diffusion and boundary effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15900)
*Xiaowen Li,Ming Mei*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies asymptotic stability of viscous shock profiles for a Burgers equation with fast diffusion on a half-space, showing convergence to a shifted shock profile despite singularities from fast diffusion and boundary layer effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the long-time behavior of solutions to the Burgers equation with fast diffusion on a half-space, particularly addressing challenges from the singularity in diffusivity at u=0 and boundary layer effects at x=0.

Method: Develops new techniques for weighted energy estimates to handle the combined difficulties of fast diffusion singularity and boundary layer effects for wave stability analysis.

Result: Demonstrates that the solution converges to a shifted shock profile U(x-st-d(t)), where the shift d(t) is governed by boundary layer dynamics at x=0 and driven by initial data.

Conclusion: Successfully establishes asymptotic stability of viscous shock profiles for the Burgers equation with fast diffusion on half-space, overcoming significant analytical challenges through innovative weighted energy estimate techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of viscous shock profile for the Burgers equation $u_t +f(u)_x = (\frac{u_{x}}{u^{1-m}})_x$ on the half-space $(0,+\infty)$, subject to the boundary conditions $u|_{x=0}=u_->0$ and $u|_{x=+\infty}=0$. Here, the parameter $\frac{1}{2}<m<1$ measures the strength of fast diffusion. A key challenge arises from the pronounced singularity in the diffusivity $\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}} \right)_x$ at $u=0$ and the boundary layer. We demonstrate that the long-time behavior of $u$ converges to a shifted shock profile $U(x-st-d(t))$, where $d(t)$ is governed by the boundary layer dynamics at $x=0$ and driven by the initial data $u(x,0)$. To overcome the singularity from fast diffusion compounded by the bad effect of boundary layer for wave stability, some new techniques for weighted energy estimates are introduced artfully.

Conclusion: The work provides novel ill-posedness results for important fluid equations, particularly being the first to address rotating Euler equations in W^{1,∞} without vorticity formulation, with applications extending to geophysical fluid systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we first present a new and simple proof of unboundedness of Riesz operator in $L^\infty$ and then establish the mild ill-posedness in $W^{1,\infty}$ of 3D rotating Euler equations and 2D Euler equations with partial damping. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one addressing the ill-posedness issue on the rotating Euler equations in $W^{1,\infty}$ without the vorticity formulation. As a further application, we prove the instability of perturbations for the 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system in $W^{1,\infty}$.

### [14] [Real-Time Inviscid Fluid Dynamics and Aero-acoustics on a Sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15982)
*Madhusraba Sinha,Jan Stratmann*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: A unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with obstacles, combining Closest Point Method, projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings analogy for stable, geometrically consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces has applications in weather visualizations, immersive games, and VR, but conventional methods struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities and lack stable high-order accuracy for PDEs on surfaces.

Method: Combines Closest Point Method (CPM) for solving surface PDEs in Cartesian embedding without parametrization, projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy for aeroacoustics. Uses signed distance functions (SDFs) for obstacles with no-slip constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments. Aeroacoustic sources computed from surface pressure force derivatives with frequency/amplitude modulation and hysteresis smoothing.

Result: Simulates inviscid fluid behavior on spherical surfaces while generating sound from fluid pressure, offering stability, geometric consistency, and supporting applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully enables real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, overcoming limitations of conventional grid-based and mesh-based approaches through geometric consistency and numerical stability.

Abstract: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.
  Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.
  Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.

### [15] [A sharp criterion and complete classification of global-in-time solutions and finite time blow-up of solutions to a chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15990)
*Yuri Soga*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Sharp threshold phenomenon for chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in supercritical dimensions: global existence vs. finite-time blow-up determined by scaling-critical Morrey norms of initial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical Keller-Segel system can be reduced to a single equation, but the indirect signal production system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and doesn't admit such reduction. Need to understand long-time behavior in supercritical dimensions.

Method: Establish sharp threshold phenomenon using scaling-critical Morrey norms of initial data. Prove existence of singular stationary solutions and show their Morrey norm values serve as critical thresholds. Identify new critical exponents.

Result: Complete classification of long-time behavior: solutions either exist globally or blow up in finite time depending on whether initial data Morrey norm is below or above critical threshold. First such results for this parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first complete classification of long-time behavior for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in supercritical dimensions, identifying sharp thresholds in terms of Morrey norms.

Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in the whole space, \begin{equation}\label{abst:p}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = Δu - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v),\\ 0 = Δv + w,\\ w_t = Δw + u \end{cases} \end{equation} with emphasis on supercritical dimensions. In contrast to the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system, where the analysis can be reduced to a single equation, the above system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and does not admit such a reduction. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold phenomenon separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up in terms of scaling-critical Morrey norms of the initial data. In particular, we prove the existence of singular stationary solutions and show that their Morrey norm values serve as the critical thresholds determining the long-time behavior of solutions. Consequently, we identify new critical exponents at which the long-time behavior of solutions changes. This yields a complete classification of the long-time behavior of solutions, providing the first such results for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system \eqref{abst:p} in supercritical dimensions.

Motivation: To develop inverse problems methods for semilinear wave equations by analyzing how oscillatory waves interact with nonlinearities and extracting information about the nonlinear coefficient from scattering measurements.

Method: Construct superposition solutions with non-oscillatory background plus single-phase highly oscillatory waves (wavelength h≪1), analyze nonlinear geometric optics expansions, and use light-ray transforms to recover q(x,u) from the leading oscillatory coefficient.

Result: The coefficient of amplitude h in the oscillatory part of the geometric optics expansion determines the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with q(x,u), which uniquely determines q(x,u) in the maximal region accessible from the data.

Conclusion: Oscillatory solutions and geometric optics expansions provide an effective framework for solving inverse problems for semilinear wave equations with null conditions, with methods extendable to systems.

Abstract: We construct oscillatory solutions of fully semilinear wave equations in Minkowski space satisfying a null condition of the form $$\square u:=(-\partial_{x_0}^2 +\sum_{j=1}^n \partial_{x_j}^2 )u= q(x,u)((\partial_{x_0}u)^2-|\nabla_{x'}u|^2),$$ $$x=(x_0,x'), \;\ x'=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \text{ and } x_0=t \text{ is the time variable,}$$ on an interval $x_0\in [-T,T]$, $T<\infty$ arbitrary, which consist of the superposition of a non-oscillatory background solution and a single phase train of highly oscillatory waves of wave length $h\ll1$ and amplitudes given by powers of $h$; the waves interact with the nonlinearity and we measure the response $u(x_0,x')|_{x_0=T'}$ at a fixed time $x_0=T'<T$.
  We show that the coefficient of amplitude $h$ of the oscillatory part of the nonlinear geometric optics expansion of the solution determines the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with $q(x,u)$, which determines $q(x,u)$ uniquely in the maximal region determined by the data. Our methods also work for systems of semilinear wave equations satisfying null conditions, but in this paper we focus on the scalar case.

We prove a noncommutative analogue of the classical Fujita theorem by identifying the critical exponent separating finite-time blow-up from global existence for small initial data. Moreover, we establish a fundamental inequality in general semifinite von Neumann algebras that is of independent interest and plays a crucial role in the study of global existence and local well-posedness of solutions of nonlinear equations in noncommutative setting.

*Kehan Shi*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies p-Laplacian equations on point clouds for hypergraph learning, showing that as data points increase with fixed labeled points, the continuum limit is a weighted p-Laplacian equation with mixed boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the asymptotic behavior of p-Laplacian equations on point clouds in semi-supervised hypergraph learning, and to establish a rigorous connection between discrete graph-based methods and continuum PDE formulations.

Method: Analyzes p-Laplacian equations on point clouds assuming independent random samples from a bounded domain. Uses viscosity solution framework to study asymptotic behavior as number of data points tends to infinity while labeled points remain fixed.

Result: For any p>d, the continuum limit is a weighted p-Laplacian equation subject to mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, providing a new discretization of the p-Laplacian on point clouds.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a rigorous continuum limit for p-Laplacian equations on point clouds, connecting discrete hypergraph learning methods to PDE theory and providing a new discretization approach.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of $p$-Laplacian equations on point clouds that arise from hypergraph learning in a semi-supervised setting. Under the assumption that the point clouds consist of independent random samples drawn from a bounded domain $Ω\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the number of data points tends to infinity, with the number of labeled points remains fixed. We show, for any $p>d$ in the viscosity solution framework, that the continuum limit is a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation subject to mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The result provides a new discretization of the $p$-Laplacian on point clouds.

*Zhibin Wang,Jiahong Wu,Ning Zhu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper solves the stability and large-time behavior problem for 2D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with fractional dissipation in only one direction, covering all fractional exponents 0≤s<1 using different techniques for different ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stability problem for 2D Navier-Stokes with dissipation in only one direction is not fully understood. This anisotropic dissipation lies between fully dissipative Navier-Stokes (which decays algebraically) and inviscid Euler (which can grow rapidly), creating a fundamental gap in understanding stability and long-time behavior.

Method: Developed different techniques for three ranges of fractional exponents: 1) 0≤s≤3/4, 2) 3/4<s<11/12, and 3) 11/12≤s<1. For the most difficult final range, introduced spatial polynomial A₂ weights and exploited boundedness of Riesz transforms on weighted L²-spaces.

Result: Successfully solved the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation Λ₁²ˢ for all 0≤s<1, including the standard case s=1 corresponding to one directional dissipation ∂₁².

Conclusion: The paper provides a complete solution to the stability problem for 2D anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation in one direction, bridging the gap between fully dissipative and inviscid cases, with novel techniques for handling different fractional exponent regimes.

Abstract: The stability problem for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with dissipation in only one direction on $\mathbb R^2$ is not fully understood. This dissipation is in the intermediate regime between the fully dissipative Navier-Stokes and the inviscid Euler. Navier-Stokes solutions in $\mathbb R^2$ decay algebraically in time while Euler solutions can grow rather rapidly in time. This paper solves the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem on the anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation $Λ_1^{2s}$ for all $0\leq s<1$. The case $s=1$ corresponds to the standard one directional dissipation $\partial_1^2$. Different techniques are developed to treat different ranges of fractional exponents: $0\leq s\leq \frac34$, $\frac34<s<\frac{11}{12}$, and $\frac{11}{12} \leq s <1$. The final range is the most difficult case, for which we introduce the spatial polynomial $A_2$ weights and exploit the boundedness of Riesz transforms on weighted $L^2$-spaces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend and improve earlier results by Azzam on the dimension drop phenomenon of harmonic measure for domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries, while providing quantitative bounds and using more elementary methods.

Method: Uses elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations instead of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments. Novel construction approach with quantitative analysis of parameters.

Result: Proves dimension drop of harmonic measure for domains with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundaries of dimension s (where n-1-δ₀ ≤ s ≤ n-1), with quantitative bounds on the δ₀ parameter.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends Azzam's results with a more elementary approach, providing quantitative bounds and avoiding complex analytic tools while establishing dimension drop for harmonic measure in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We extend earlier results of Azzam on the dimension drop of the harmonic measure for a domain $Ω\subset \R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$, with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundary $\partialΩ$ of dimension $s$ with $n-1-δ_0 \leq s\leq n-1$, that is uniformly non flat. Here $δ_0$ is a small positive constant dependent on the parameters of the problem. Our novel construction relies on elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations. We avoid the use of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments, and also give quantitative bounds on the $δ_0$ parameter.

*Alix Deleporte,Jean Lagacé,Marc Rouveyrol*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Equivalence between L² norms on Riemannian manifolds and subsets for spectrally localized functions, with thickness condition and injectivity radius-independent constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish norm equivalence properties for functions with spectral localization on Riemannian manifolds, particularly when dealing with subsets that satisfy geometric thickness conditions. This addresses questions about how well functions can be controlled on subsets versus the whole manifold in spectral analysis contexts.

Method: Uses Riemannian geometry with smooth metrics satisfying sectional curvature bounds. Considers functions in the range of spectral projectors (spectrally localized functions). Analyzes equivalence between L² norms on the full manifold M and subsets ω satisfying an optimal thickness condition.

Result: Shows equivalence property between L² norms on M and subsets ω with thickness condition for spectrally localized functions. The constant depends only on dimension, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold, but crucially not on the injectivity radius. The thickness condition is proven to be optimal.

Conclusion: Provides a fundamental norm equivalence result for spectral analysis on Riemannian manifolds, with constants independent of injectivity radius, which has important implications for spectral geometry, PDEs, and control theory on manifolds.

Abstract: Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ endowed with a smooth metric $g$ satisfying upper and lower sectional curvature bounds, we show an equivalence property between the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on $M$ and the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on subsets $ω$ satisfying a thickness condition, for functions in the range of a spectral projector. The thickness condition is known to be optimal in this setting. The constant appearing in the equivalence of norms property depends only on the dimension of the manifold, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold of the spectral cutoff, but, crucially, not on the injectivity radius.

*Itahisa Barrios-Cubas,Matteo Bonforte,María del Mar González,Clara Torres-Latorre*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Proves Pohozaev identity for Spectral Fractional Laplacian, enabling non-existence results for semilinear Dirichlet problems in star-shaped domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL) had a Pohozaev identity established in 2014, but the Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL) differs fundamentally and requires a new approach since the RFL integration by parts strategy doesn't apply.

Method: Develops a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure, expressing the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix dependent on Laplacian eigenvalues and fractional exponent.

Result: Successfully proves a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian, which allows establishing non-existence results for semilinear Dirichlet problems in star-shaped domains.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian using a spectral approach, overcoming fundamental differences from the Restricted Fractional Laplacian and enabling new non-existence results.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL). This identity allows us to establish non-existence results for the semilinear Dirichlet problem $(-Δ|_Ω)^su = f(u)$ in star-shaped domains. The first such identity for non-local operators was established by Ros-Oton and Serra in 2014 for the Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL). However, the SFL differs fundamentally from the RFL, and the integration by parts strategy of Ros-Oton and Serra cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure. Our main result expresses the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix that depends on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the fractional exponent.

*Alex Alberts,Akshay Jacob Thomas,Kamran Daryabeigi,Ilias Bilionis*

TL;DR: Bayesian framework using information field theory reconstructs thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse data, enabling accurate predictions with uncertainty quantification for spacecraft thermal protection system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft thermal protection systems require accurate thermal conductivity data across extreme temperature/pressure ranges, but conventional lab measurements are limited to lower temperatures than actual atmospheric entry scenarios, and often only temperature measurements are available, requiring indirect inference.

Method: Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) where conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, with physics enforced via a physics-informed prior over temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces infinite-dimensional posterior distribution quantifying uncertainty.

Result: Method applied to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with synthetic and experimental data successfully reconstructs thermal conductivity beyond experimental regime. Inferred conductivities validated against reference data and propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories.

Conclusion: IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust thermal protection system sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement, addressing critical needs for spacecraft design.

Abstract: The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.

TL;DR: Geodite is a new equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces computationally expensive Clebsch-Gordan tensor products, achieving competitive accuracy with 3-5x faster inference speed for atomistic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current equivariant architectures for interatomic potentials face a trade-off between accuracy and speed due to expensive Clebsch-Gordan tensor products that scale poorly with angular resolution, limiting practical applications of machine-learned potentials.

Method: Geodite introduces an equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces tensor products while incorporating physical priors to ensure smooth potential energy surfaces. It was trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset of inorganic crystals.

Result: Geodite-MP achieves accuracy competitive with leading methods on benchmarks for materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon-derived properties, and nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics, while running 3-5x faster than similarly performing models.

Conclusion: Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening by combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, overcoming previous limitations of computational cost in machine-learned interatomic potentials.

Abstract: Foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for atomistic simulations, promising near first-principles accuracy across diverse chemical spaces at a fraction of the cost of quantum-mechanical calculations. However, the most accurate equivariant architectures rely on Clebsch-Gordan tensor products whose computational cost scales steeply with angular resolution, creating a trade-off between model expressiveness and inference speed that ultimately limits practical applications. Here we introduce Geodite, an equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces tensor products while incorporating physical priors to ensure smooth, well-behaved potential energy surfaces. Trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset of inorganic crystals, Geodite-MP achieves accuracy competitive with leading methods on benchmarks for materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon-derived properties, and nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics, while running $3\text{--}5\times$ faster than models performing similarly. By combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

TL;DR: ConvLSTM neural network developed as spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of shock propagation in granular media, enabling faster parameter exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mesoscale hydrocodes for granular materials under impact are computationally expensive, limiting parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. Need efficient surrogate models.

Method: Developed convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) neural network as sequence-to-sequence model trained on 2D hydrocode simulation data. Used pressure-field image sequences as input-output pairs to predict future frames from short history. Tested on "billiard break" problem and granular shock compaction.

Result: Compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces pressure wave propagation and particle motion for unseen impact conditions. Captures compaction front position/shape dependence on impact speed, smoothing fine pore-scale details as expected.

Conclusion: ConvLSTM models serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated parameter space exploration and laying groundwork for physics-informed mesoscale simulations.

Abstract: Granular materials subjected to impact loading exhibit highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics governed by wave propagation, pore collapse, and grain-scale rearrangements. Mesoscale hydrocodes resolve these processes but are computationally expensive, limiting their use in parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we develop a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network as a spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of weak shock propagation in granular media. Using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations as training data, we first consider a simplified "billiard break" problem in which a cue ball impacts a cluster of nine circular balls, all deformable. Sequences of pressure-field images serve as input-output pairs for a sequence-to-sequence ConvLSTM, which is trained to predict future frames from a short history. We compare several architectures and show that a relatively compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces the propagation of the pressure wave and the resulting particle motion for an unseen combination of cue-ball position and impact velocity. As a proof-of-concept extension, we apply the same ConvLSTM framework to previously published mesoscale simulations of weak shock compaction in a granular ensemble. When evaluated at piston impact speeds that were completely withheld from training, the surrogate captures the position and shape of the compaction front and its dependence on impact speed, while smoothing fine pore-scale details in the highly compacted region as expected. These results demonstrate that ConvLSTM models can serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated exploration of parameter space and laying the groundwork for physics-informed, mesoscale simulations of granular materials under shock loading.

TL;DR: A unified asymptotic scaling theory for ETG and ITG turbulence predicts cubic scaling for electron heat flux and linear scaling for ion heat flux, validated by gyrokinetic simulations across magnetic geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turbulent transport driven by ETG and ITG instabilities is a major obstacle in fusion confinement. Current predictive models are either computationally expensive (gyrokinetic simulations) or rely on data fitting, limiting their utility for reactor design optimization.

Method: Developed a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG and ITG turbulence by balancing three fundamental time scales: linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation. The theory isolates heat flux dependence to two key parameters: parallel system scale and outer-scale aspect ratio.

Result: The theory predicts distinct scaling laws: cubic scaling with temperature gradient for electron heat flux (ETG) and linear scaling for ion heat flux (ITG). Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm these predictions across different magnetic geometries (slab, tokamak, stellarator), including first numerical confirmation of cubic ETG scaling.

Conclusion: The framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models by isolating dependence on just two key parameters. This offers a pathway toward reactor optimization in both tokamaks and stellarators, bridging the gap between expensive simulations and practical design tools.

Abstract: Turbulent transport remains one of the principal obstacles to achieving efficient magnetic confinement in fusion devices. Two of the dominant drivers of the turbulence are microscale instabilities fuelled by electron- and ion-temperature gradients (ETG and ITG), whose nonlinear saturation determines the cross-field transport of particles and energy. Despite decades of study, predictive modelling of this turbulence has been limited either to expensive gyrokinetic simulations or to reduced models calibrated by fitting to numerical or experimental data, restricting their utility for reactor design. Here we present a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence within a common framework. By balancing the fundamental time scales of linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation, the theory isolates the dependence of the heat flux on equilibrium parameters to two key quantities: the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio. We show that these quantities encapsulate the essential physics of saturation, leading to distinct predictions for ETG and ITG transport: a cubic scaling with the temperature gradient in the electron channel, and a linear scaling in the ion channel. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that these theoretical predictions hold irrespective of the magnetic geometry (slab, tokamak, or stellarator), including the first numerical confirmation of the cubic ETG scaling anticipated by earlier theory. By isolating the dependence on just the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio, our framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimisation in both tokamaks and stellarators.

Motivation: The density limit disruption in tokamak plasmas remains an unresolved barrier to achieving high-density fusion reactors needed for high energy gain. Understanding the origin of these disruptions is crucial for future fusion reactors.

Method: High-density experiments using conventional gas-puff fueling on HL-2A NBI and Ohmically heated plasmas, reaching Greenwald density ratios ~1. Simulation analysis was used to identify the MHD instabilities.

Result: First discovery of multiple-branch MHD instabilities in core plasmas when n_e/n_eG > 0.85. These core-localized MHD activities are identified as Alfvénic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes, which trigger minor or major disruptions when density is peaked.

Conclusion: These findings are crucial for understanding the origin of density limit disruptions and for developing methods to forecast and avoid them in future fusion reactors, addressing a long-standing mystery in magnetic confinement fusion.

Abstract: To achieve a high energy gain, the fusion reactor plasma must reach a very high density. However, the tokamak plasmas ofen undergo disruption when the density exceeds the Greenwald density. The density limit disruption in tokamak plasmas is a mysterious barrier to magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, and hitherto, is still an unresolved issue. Over the past several years, the high density experiments with Greenwald density ratio $n_e/n_{eG}\sim1$ has been carried out using the conventional gas-puff fuelling method in HL-2A NBI and Ohmically heated plasmas. It is found for the first time that there are multiple-branch MHD instabilities in the core plasmas while $n_e/n_{eG}>0.85$. The simulation analysis suggests that the core-localized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) activities belong to Alfv${é}$nic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes, and on experiment firstly, it is discovered that they trigger the minor or major disruption of bulk plasmas while the density is peaked. These new findings are of great importance to figure out and understand the origin of density limit disruptions, as well as to forecast and avoid them for future fusion rectors.

Conclusion: These new findings of core-localized kinetic MHD instabilities near density limit are crucial for understanding the origin of the density limit in magnetic confinement fusion.

Abstract: The density limit is a mysterious barrier to magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, and is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we will present the experimental results of the density limit and core-localized kinetic MHD instabilities on HL-2A. Firstly, the high density shots with $ne/ne_G>1$ have been achieved by the conventional gas-puff fuelling method in Ohmic heating plasmas, and the corresponding duration time is close to $t\sim500$ ms ($\sim$ $30τ_E$), where $τ_E$ is the global energy confinement time. Secondly, it is found for the first time that there are kinetic MHD instabilities in the core plasmas while $ne/ne_G\sim1$. The analysis suggests that the core-localized MHD activities belong to Alfv{é}nic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes or kinetic ballooning modes (KBM), and firstly it is found on experiment that they trigger the minor or major disruption of bulk plasmas while the density profile is peaked.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron energy dynamics (absorption, conversion, transport, dissipation) is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications in low-temperature plasmas like CCPs.

Method: Proposed kinetic-moment framework based on PIC/MCC simulations that reconstructs velocity moments from Boltzmann equation data, separates total energy transport into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations, and decomposes pressure-strain interaction.

Result: At low pressure: electrons gain directed kinetic energy in sheath, convert locally to thermal energy via pressure-strain interaction and collisions; thermal energy transported to bulk and dissipated by inelastic collisions; pressure-strain decomposition reveals significant thermalization beyond collisions; heat flux deviates from Fourier's law.

Conclusion: The framework provides clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas, showing coexistence of localized conversion and nonlocal transport dominated by microscopic heat flux.

Abstract: Understanding electron energy dynamics in low-temperature plasmas such as capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), including energy absorption, conversion, transport, and dissipation, is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications. We propose a kinetic-moment framework based on particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. The framework reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from PIC/MCC data and enables a quantitative, self-consistent description of electron energy dynamics in low-pressure CCPs. To clarify energy conversion among electromagnetic energy, electron fluid kinetic (mechanical) energy, and electron thermal (internal) energy, we further separate the total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations. We find that, at low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is then transported into the bulk and is dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. We further decompose pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation, which correspond to conversion driven by volumetric compression or expansion and by shear deformation, respectively. This decomposition reveals a significant thermalization channel beyond collisions. More broadly, the results show coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near the sheath and nonlocal energy transport from the sheath to the bulk dominated by microscopic heat flux. The heat flux deviates strongly from Fourier's law based on local temperature gradients. This framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and offers a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas.

### [31] [Non-Ambipolarity of Microturbulent Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15661)
*Allen H Boozer*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Electrostatic microturbulence creates chaotic magnetic field lines that drive electron transport, which can counterbalance non-ambipolar ion diffusion and affect impurity confinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how electrostatic microturbulence-induced magnetic field chaos affects plasma transport, particularly how electron transport can balance non-ambipolar ion diffusion that would otherwise require radial electric fields for impurity confinement.

Method: Analyze quasi-neutrality along chaotic magnetic field lines, derive potential equation, calculate electron transport diffusion coefficient, and determine electron flow viscosity that can counterbalance non-ambipolar ion diffusion.

Result: Derived electron transport diffusion coefficient D_ef = (Δ/a_T)T_e/eB, where Δ is correlation distance and a_T is temperature scale length. Calculated maximum non-ambipolar diffusion that can be balanced and required plasma beta to avoid shielding magnetic perturbations.

Conclusion: Chaotic magnetic fields from electrostatic microturbulence produce significant electron transport that can balance non-ambipolar ion diffusion, affecting impurity confinement requirements and establishing plasma beta thresholds for magnetic perturbation effectiveness.

Abstract: Even what is called electrostatic microturbulence produces a plasma-beta-dependent turbulent magnetic field $\tilde{B}$, which makes the magnetic field lines chaotic. Quasi-neutrality along the chaotic magnetic field lines requires a potential that obeys $\vec{B}\cdot \vec{\nabla} Φ= \vec{B}\cdot \vec{\nabla} p_e$, where $p_e$ is the electron pressure. This potential produces radial transport similar to that of diffusion coefficient $D_{ef}= (Δ/a_T)T_e/eB$. $Δ$ is the radial distance over which the potential $Φ$ is correlated by the electron motion along the chaotic magnetic field, and $|dT_e/dr| = T_e/a_T$. The chaos-produced electron transport gives an effective viscosity on the electron flow, which can counter balance a non-ambipolar part of the ion radial particle diffusion $f_{na}$. This non-ambipolarity would otherwise require a radial electric field that confines ions and hence impurities. The maximum $f_{na}$ that can be counterbalanced and the required plasma beta to avoid shielding the magnetic perturbations $\tilde{B}$ are calculated.

*Juan Gomez Quispe,Matheus Medina,Subhendu Mishra,Douglas S Galvao,Abhishek Singh,Pedro Alves da Silva Autreto*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Graphyne materials with B-N co-doping show promise for hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis, with ortho substitution in γ-graphyne providing optimal balance of hydrogen adsorption strength and structural stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chemical doping (B, N, B-N) affects graphyne's electronic properties and hydrogen adsorption behavior for potential HER catalyst applications.

Method: Combined Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics simulations to evaluate pristine and doped γ-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne variants (meta/ortho/para).

Result: B-N co-doping creates near thermo-neutral hydrogen adsorption hotspots on sp-proximate carbon sites; ortho substitution in γ-graphyne shows best stability with controlled hydrogen uptake, while other configurations degrade.

Conclusion: B-N geometry is a critical design parameter for graphyne-based HER catalysts, requiring both favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy and finite-temperature stability against over-hydrogenation.

Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $γ$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $γ$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $π$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $γ$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.

TL;DR: Numerical analysis of 5 finite-difference schemes for 2D supersonic inviscid flows shows significant scheme-dependent shock resolution differences, with one AUSM+ formulation proving most robust against numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how numerical schemes and mesh geometry affect solutions of 2D supersonic inviscid flows (compressible Euler equations), particularly focusing on shock wave resolution capabilities for external flows around blunt bodies.

Method: Comparative analysis of five finite-difference schemes: Beam-Warming implicit approximate factorization, original Steger-Warming flux vector splitting, van Leer flux vector splitting, and two novel finite-difference interpretations of Liou's AUSM+ scheme. Used freestream subtraction, flux limiting, and artificial dissipation to address numerical issues.

Result: Significant scheme-dependent changes in shock structure observed, with non-physical upstream perturbations. One AUSM+ formulation proved particularly robust in avoiding numerical disturbances. Good agreement achieved with existing numerical and experimental results.

Conclusion: Numerical scheme selection and domain transformation procedures significantly impact shock resolution in supersonic flows. The proposed AUSM+ formulation demonstrates superior robustness against numerical artifacts while maintaining accuracy compared to established schemes.

Abstract: The effects induced by numerical schemes and mesh geometry on the solution of two-dimensional supersonic inviscid flows are investigated in the context of the compressible Euler equations. Five different finite-difference schemes are considered: the Beam and Warming implicit approximate factorization algorithm, the original Steger and Warming flux vector splitting algorithm, the van Leer approach on performing the flux vector splitting and two different novel finite-difference interpretations of the Liou AUSM+ scheme. Special focus is given to the shock wave resolution capabilities of each scheme for the solution of an external supersonic inviscid flows around a blunt body. Significant changes in the shock structure are observed, mainly due to special properties of the scheme in use and the influence of the domain transformation procedure. Perturbations in the supersonic flow upstream of the shock are also seen in the solution, which is a non-physical behavior. Freestream subtraction, flux limiting and the explicit addition of artificial dissipation are employed in order to circumvent these problems. One of the AUSM+ formulations presented here is seen to be particularly more robust in avoiding the appearance of some of these numerically-induced disturbances and non-physical characteristics in the solution. Good agreement is achieved with both numerical and experimental results available in the literature.}

### [35] [Numerical Aspects of Gradient Reconstruction Schemes Applied to Complex Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15522)

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Study compares three gradient reconstruction techniques for viscous term calculation in unstructured finite volume methods, examines limiter functions for stability, and proposes a novel CFL-based convergence acceleration method for compressible RANS simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate and compare different gradient reconstruction techniques for accurate calculation of viscous terms in unstructured grid finite volume methods, while addressing stability issues with limiter functions and improving convergence efficiency for compressible flow simulations.

Method: Uses cell-centered finite volume formulation on unstructured grids with compressible RANS equations and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Compares three gradient reconstruction techniques for viscous terms, employs Roe solver for inviscid terms, and implements a novel convergence acceleration technique with three simple rules for CFL control based on residue evolution.

Result: Simplest gradient reconstruction caused severe numerical instabilities, while more sophisticated formulations provided excellent agreement with literature. Results were insensitive to entropy fix terms, aerodynamic forces mildly dependent on limiter formulation even without shocks, and the proposed convergence acceleration effectively drove residues to machine zero when no major instabilities were present.

Conclusion: Gradient reconstruction technique selection is crucial for stability and accuracy in viscous term calculation for unstructured grid methods. More sophisticated gradient formulations outperform simpler ones, while the proposed CFL-based convergence acceleration technique effectively improves solution efficiency for steady-state compressible flow simulations.

Abstract: This work primarily focuses on the study of three gradient reconstruction techniques applied to the calculation of viscous terms in a cell-centered, finite volume formulation for general unstructured grids. The work also addresses different ways of formulating the limiter functions necessary to maintain stability in the presence of flow discontinuities. The flows of interest are simulated using the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the negative Spalart-Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. Definition of interface inviscid terms uses the Roe approximate Riemann solver, whereas the interface viscous terms are calculated with a standard centered scheme together with appropriate definitions of the interface gradients. Steady state solutions are obtained using an implicit time-integration method, together with a novel convergence acceleration technique. This new approach defines a set of three simple rules for controlling the global CFL number based on the residue evolution. The work considers three test cases, namely, the subsonic bump-in-channel flow, the subsonic NASA high-lift Common Research Model multielement airfoil and the transonic ONERA M6 wing. Present results are compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature. Severe numerical instabilities are observed when the simplest gradient reconstruction technique is used, while more sophisticated formulations are able to provide excellent agreement with the existing literature. Current results are demonstrated to be highly insensitive to modifications made to the numerical flux entropy fix terms. Integrated aerodynamic forces are shown to be mildly dependent on the limiter formulation used, even in the absence of shock waves. The proposed convergence acceleration procedure manages to quickly drive the residue terms to machine zero, provided no major instabilities are present.

TL;DR: A high-performance Python framework for simulating 2D Diffusion-Limited Aggregation using Numba JIT compilation, revealing a crossover from fractal to compact growth at high walker densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reproducible, open-source testbed for exploring phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, specifically investigating Laplacian growth instability across different injection geometries and walker concentrations.

Method: Developed dla-ideal-solver framework using Numba-accelerated Python with JIT compilation for high-performance DLA simulations. Analyzed aggregates using mass-radius scaling, generalized Rényi dimensions, and lacunarity metrics to quantify fractal properties and spatial heterogeneity.

Result: Confirmed standard fractal dimension D_f ≈ 1.71 for dilute regimes (Witten-Sander universality class), but discovered crossover to Eden-like compact growth (D_f ≈ 1.87) in high-density environments due to screening length saturation. Achieved computational throughput comparable to legacy static implementations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully establishes a reproducible platform for studying non-equilibrium phase transitions, revealing density-dependent growth transitions in DLA systems and demonstrating that high-performance Python implementations can match traditional compiled code performance.

Abstract: We present dla-ideal-solver, a high-performance framework for simulating two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) using Numba-accelerated Python. By leveraging just-in-time (JIT) compilation, we achieve computational throughput comparable to legacy static implementations while retaining high-level flexibility. We investigate the Laplacian growth instability across varying injection geometries and walker concentrations. Our analysis confirms the robustness of the standard fractal dimension $D_f \approx 1.71$ for dilute regimes, consistent with the Witten-Sander universality class. However, we report a distinct crossover to Eden-like compact growth ($D_f \approx 1.87$) in high-density environments, attributed to the saturation of the screening length. Beyond standard mass-radius scaling, we employ generalized Rényi dimensions and lacunarity metrics to quantify the monofractal character and spatial heterogeneity of the aggregates. This work establishes a reproducible, open-source testbed for exploring phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

*Thomas Barthel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TTNS reduce graph distance compared to MPS but surprisingly MPS remains more efficient for large D>1 systems despite TTNS advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) have shown promise for simulating 2D quantum systems and benchmarking quantum simulations, but there's a puzzling efficiency gap compared to matrix product states (MPS) for large systems in higher dimensions.

Method: Analyzing computational cost scaling for D=2 and 3 systems under entanglement area law assumptions, comparing TTNS and MPS approaches for different boundary conditions.

Result: Despite TTNS reducing graph distance between physical degrees of freedom, MPS simulations of low-energy states are more efficient for large systems in D>1 spatial dimensions.

Conclusion: The theoretical advantage of TTNS in reducing graph distance doesn't translate to practical efficiency gains over MPS for large systems in higher dimensions under area law entanglement scaling.

Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

Result: Establishes existence of weak solutions for compressible viscous fluids with stochastic forcing under slip boundary conditions on bounded domains with C^{2+ν}-boundary (ν>0).

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a consistent notion of weak solutions and proves their existence for stochastic compressible viscous fluids with slip boundary conditions, combining advanced approximation techniques to handle the mathematical challenges posed by the boundary conditions.

Abstract: We study a mathematical model of a compressible viscous fluid driven by stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions of friction type. We introduce a notion of a weak solution that is analytically and probabilistically consistent with this model.

Conclusion: Tensor networks provide a unified treatment for neural and symbolic AI, enabling efficient scaling of reasoning algorithms and training of hybrid models that combine logical and probabilistic approaches.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.
