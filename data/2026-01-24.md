### [1] [Efficient Numerical Reconstruction of Wave Equation Sources via Droplet-Induced Asymptotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15787)
*Shutong Hou,Mourad Sini,Haibing Wang*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A novel method for solving 3D acoustic wave inverse source problems using high-contrast droplet injection and single-point measurements, enabling stable reconstructions where conventional approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches to acoustic wave inverse source problems suffer from ill-posedness and require extensive spatial measurements. There's a need for stable reconstruction methods that work with limited data, particularly for applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing.

Method: Inject a small high-contrast droplet into the medium and measure wave field perturbations at a single external point over time. Use asymptotic expansion based on the Newtonian operator eigensystem, solve time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation, employ Riesz basis expansions, and use mollification-based numerical differentiations for source reconstruction.

Result: The method enables stable source reconstructions with only single-point measurements. 3D numerical experiments demonstrate accurate source recovery under noise (SNR ~ 1/a), with error analysis for droplet size (order a) and number of spectral modes N.

Conclusion: The novel approach successfully overcomes traditional limitations of acoustic wave inverse source problems, providing stable reconstructions with minimal measurement requirements, opening new possibilities for practical applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and numerically implement a novel approach for solving the inverse source problem of the acoustic wave equation in three dimensions. By injecting a small high-contrast droplet into the medium, we exploit the resulting wave field perturbation measured at a single external point over time. The method enables stable source reconstructions where conventional approaches fail due to ill-posedness, with potential applications in medical imaging and non-destructive testing. Key contributions include:
  1. Implementation of a theoretically justified asymptotic expansion, from [33], using the eigensystem of the Newtonian operator, with error analysis for the spectral truncation.
  2. Novel numerical schemes for solving the time-domain Lippmann-Schwinger equation and reconstructing the source via Riesz basis expansions and mollification-based numerical differentiations.
  3. Reconstruction requiring only single-point measurements, overcoming traditional spatial data limitations.
  4. 3D numerical experiments demonstrating accurate source recovery under noise (SNR of the order $1/a$), with error analysis for the droplet size (of the order $a$) and the number of spectral modes $N$.

*Miguel A. Piñar*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are applied as a tool in spectral methods for solving boundary-value problems on the unit ball, particularly for stationary Schrödinger equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials can be effectively utilized within spectral methods for solving boundary-value problems, specifically for stationary Schrödinger equations on the unit ball.

Method: Using a variational formulation where a Sobolev inner product naturally arises; constructing a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials satisfying boundary conditions; representing basis in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials; establishing connection formulas with classical orthogonal polynomials; deriving Sobolev Fourier coefficients recursively.

Result: A numerical experiment is presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed method using Sobolev orthogonal polynomials for solving boundary-value problems on the unit ball.

Conclusion: Sobolev orthogonal polynomials serve as a valuable tool in spectral methods for boundary-value problems, providing a systematic framework for solving stationary Schrödinger equations on the unit ball through variational formulations and orthogonal polynomial bases.

Abstract: Our main objective in this work is to show how Sobolev orthogonal polynomials emerge as a useful tool within the framework of spectral methods for boundary-value problems. The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schrödinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.

### [3] [Canonical structure of the LLG equation for exponential updates in micromagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16122)
*Jörg Schröder,Maximilian Vorwerk*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Proposes an exponential update algorithm for magnetic moments in micromagnetics that preserves the unit length constraint of magnetization vectors through geometric integration on spheres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While geometric structures for magnetic moment updates are obvious and some works use exponential algorithms, there's no canonical structure for exponential update algorithms in micromagnetism that properly handles the unit length constraint of magnetization vectors.

Method: Uses tensor algebraic reformulations of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to create canonical representations, then develops an efficient update scheme based on the structure of exponentials of skew-symmetric matrices, enabling geometric integration on spheres.

Result: The proposed exponential update algorithm demonstrates excellent performance in representative examples, showing it effectively preserves the unit length constraint while efficiently updating magnetic moments.

Conclusion: The exponential update algorithm provides a canonical and efficient approach for simulating magnetic moments in micromagnetics that naturally satisfies the physical constraint of unit magnetization vectors through geometric integration principles.

Abstract: In this contribution we propose an exponential update algorithm for magnetic moments appearing in the framework of micromagnetics and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. This algorithm can be interpreted as the geometric integration on spheres, that a priori satisfy the unit length constraint of the normalized magnetization vector. Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators. Based on the specific structure of the exponential of skew symmetric matrices an efficient update scheme is derived. The excellent performance of the proposed exponential update algorithm is demonstrated in representative examples.

### [4] [A hybrid reconstruction of piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16124)
*Guohui Song,Congzhi Xia*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining non-uniform filter reconstruction with stable extrapolation achieves exponential accuracy for piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data, overcoming Gibbs phenomenon near discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data is challenging due to Gibbs phenomenon near jump discontinuities, which causes slow convergence in existing methods.

Method: 1) Extend filter method for uniform Fourier data to non-uniform setting using admissible frames; 2) Combine non-uniform filter method with stable extrapolation to recover function values near jump discontinuities.

Result: The non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from jumps but slowly near discontinuities; the hybrid method achieves exponential accuracy uniformly across the entire domain.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively overcomes Gibbs phenomenon limitations, providing uniformly exponential reconstruction accuracy for piece-wise smooth functions from non-uniform Fourier data.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing piece-wise smooth functions from their non-uniform Fourier data. We first extend the filter method for uniform Fourier data to the non-uniform setting by using the techniques of admissible frames. We show that the proposed non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from the jump discontinuities. However, the convergence rate is significantly slower near the jump discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon. To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities. We show that the proposed hybrid method could achieve exponential accuracy uniformly on the entire domain. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Time-fractional porous medium and fast diffusion equations exhibit fundamentally different behavior from their classical counterparts, particularly regarding mass conservation and extinction phenomena, with L¹-solutions maintaining their properties globally without finite-time extinction.

Abstract: We establish the global existence and uniqueness of $L^1$-solutions to the Cauchy problem for time-fractional porous medium type nonlinear diffusion equations. Furthermore, we give the mass conservation law for $L^1$-solutions to time-fractional fast diffusion equations, and prove that the finite-time extinction does not occur for any nonnegative $L^1$-solutions.

### [6] [Linear stability of the first bifurcation in a tumor growth free boundary problem via local bifurcation structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15647)
*Junying Chen,Ruixiang Xing*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes linear stability of bifurcation solutions in a 3D tumor growth model with Robin boundary conditions, showing that the transcritical bifurcation solution is unstable under non-radially symmetric perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed existence of stationary bifurcation solutions for tumor growth models, but their stability analysis was challenging due to lack of explicit expressions and high-dimensional kernel issues at eigenvalue 0.

Method: Uses bifurcation curve structure to analyze stability instead of standard methods, overcomes difficulties from eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 in linearized operator.

Result: Proves transcritical bifurcation with μ₂'(0)<0 and shows the stationary bifurcation solution (σ₂(ε),p₂(ε),r₂(ε)) is linearly unstable for small |ε| under non-radially symmetric perturbations.

Conclusion: The bifurcation structure approach successfully analyzes stability where standard methods fail, revealing instability of bifurcation solutions despite radial symmetry stability.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a 3-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth with the Robin boundary condition. The system involves a positive parameter $μ$ which reflects the intensity of tumor aggressiveness. Huang, Zhang and Hu [Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl. 2017(35), 483-502] have shown that for each $μ_n$ ($n$ even) in a strictly increasing sequence $\{ μ_n \}(n\geq 2)$, there exists a stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_n(\varepsilon),p_n(\varepsilon),r_n(\varepsilon))$ with $μ= μ_n(\varepsilon)$ bifurcating from $μ_n$. We first derive that the bifurcation curve $(r_2(\varepsilon),μ_2(\varepsilon))$ exhibits a transcritical bifurcation with $μ_2'(0)<0$. Moreover, we show that the stationary bifurcation solution $(σ_2(\varepsilon),p_2(\varepsilon),r_2(\varepsilon))$ is linearly unstable for small $|\varepsilon|$ under non-radially symmetric perturbations. In contrast to the linear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, the lack of explicit expressions for bifurcation solutions adds great difficulty in analyzing their linear stability. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of the bifurcation curve's structure to overcome the above difficulties. Moreover, this linear stability result is not established using the standard method, due to an eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 for the linearized operator.

### [7] [Local smoothing estimates for bilinear Fourier integral operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15667)
*Duván Cardona*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper formulates a bilinear smoothing conjecture for Fourier integral operators, shows it follows from the linear case, and establishes results in 2D with partial progress in higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the celebrated linear local smoothing conjecture by Sogge to the bilinear setting for Fourier integral operators, creating a unified framework that connects linear and bilinear smoothing theories.

Method: Formulates a bilinear smoothing conjecture derived from Sogge's linear case, proves that the linear conjecture implies the bilinear version, and uses recent progress on linear smoothing to establish results in dimension 2 and partial results in higher dimensions.

Result: Establishes local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension d=2, shows partial progress for d≥3, and proves that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions d.

Conclusion: The bilinear smoothing conjecture is a natural extension of Sogge's linear theory, and the approach successfully connects linear and bilinear smoothing, yielding concrete results in low dimensions and for odd dimensions.

Abstract: We formulate a local smoothing conjecture for bilinear Fourier integral operators in every dimension $d \ge 2,$ derived from the celebrated linear case due to Sogge, which we refer to as the \emph{bilinear smoothing conjecture}. We show that the linear local smoothing conjecture implies this bilinear version. As a consequence of our approach and due to the recent progress on the subject, we establish local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension $d=2,$ that is, on $\mathbb{R}^2_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$. Also, a partial progress is presented for the high-dimensional case $d\geq 3.$ In particular, our method allows us to deduce that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions $d$.

### [8] [Global regularity for the Navier-Stokes equations with application to global solvability for the Euler equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15685)
*Myong-Hwan Ri*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper proves that Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the d-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (d≥3) with initial data in H^s for s≥-1+d/2 are globally regular and belong to L^∞(0,∞; H^s).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish global regularity for Leray-Hopf weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with initial data in certain Sobolev spaces, addressing a long-standing open problem in fluid dynamics.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Construct a supercritical space with sparse inverse logarithmic weight in frequency domain; 2) Obtain energy estimates for high frequency parts involving the supercritical norm; 3) Superpose energy norms of high frequency parts to get viscosity-independent estimates via re-scaling arguments.

Result: Proves that any Leray-Hopf weak solution with initial data u₀∈H^s(ℝ^d) for s≥-1+d/2 belongs to L^∞(0,∞; H^s(ℝ^d)) and is thus globally regular for all d≥3.

Conclusion: The paper establishes global regularity for Navier-Stokes equations in dimensions d≥3 for initial data in Sobolev spaces H^s with s≥-1+d/2, providing a significant advancement in the mathematical theory of fluid dynamics.

Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to the $d$-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations $(d\geq 3)$ with initial values $u_0\in H^{s}(\mathbb R^d)$, $s\geq -1+\frac{d}{2}$, belongs to $L^\infty(0,\infty; H^{s}(\mathbb R^d))$ and thus it is globally regular. For the proof, first, we construct a supercritical space which has very sparse inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain, compared to the critical homogeneous Sobolev $\dot{H}^{-1+d/2}$-norm. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm as a factor of the upper bounds. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical and subcritical norms independent of the viscosity coefficient for the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.

### [9] [Riemann-Hilbert approach for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a step-like oscillating background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15841)
*Yan Rybalko*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper develops Riemann-Hilbert formalism for the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, focusing on pure oscillating step initial data and deriving three families of two-soliton solutions based on parameter relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, which has applications in nonlinear wave phenomena and integrable systems with nonlocal interactions.

Method: Develops Riemann-Hilbert formalism for the problem, with particular attention to pure oscillating step initial data (zero for x<0, A·cos(2Bx) for x≥0). Uses inverse scattering transform techniques adapted to nonlocal equations.

Result: Successfully develops the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating boundary conditions. Derives three new families of two-soliton solutions corresponding to different parameter regimes: B < A/4, B > A/4, and B = A/4.

Conclusion: The Riemann-Hilbert approach is effective for analyzing the nonlocal modified KdV equation with oscillating step-like boundary conditions, and the derived two-soliton solutions reveal interesting parameter-dependent behavior in the system.

Abstract: This work focuses on the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ u_t(x,t)+6u(x,t)u(-x,-t)u_x(x,t)+u_{xxx}(x,t)=0, $$ with the oscillating step-like boundary conditions: $u(x,t)\to 0$ as $x\to-\infty$ and $u(x,t)\backsimeq A\cos(2Bx+8B^3t)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $A,B>0$ are arbitrary constants. The main goal is to develop the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for this problem, paying a particular attention to the case of the ``pure oscillating step'' initial data, that is $u(x,0)=0$ for $x<0$ and $u(x,0)=A\cos(2Bx)$ for $x\geq0$. Also, we derive three new families of two-soliton solutions, which correspond to the values of $A$ and $B$ satisfying $B<\frac{A}{4}$, $B>\frac{A}{4}$, and $B=\frac{A}{4}$.

### [11] [Recovery of nonlinear material parameters in a quasilinear Lamé system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15881)
*David Johansson,Yavar Kian*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Unique and stable recovery of nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary stress measurements using prescribed boundary displacements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inverse problem of determining nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary measurements, which is important for material characterization and nondestructive testing in engineering applications.

Method: Use boundary stress measurements at finite points (single point for isotropic case) generated by explicit class of affine boundary displacements. Employ structural properties of nonlinear Lamé systems, asymptotic expansions of boundary stress, and tensorial calculus.

Result: Prove unique and stable recovery of wide class of space-independent nonlinear elastic tensors, including identification of two nonlinear isotropic Lamé moduli and certain anisotropic tensors.

Conclusion: The inverse problem for nonlinear elastic materials can be solved with limited boundary measurements, enabling practical material parameter identification from sparse experimental data.

Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of determining nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary stress measurements corresponding to prescribed boundary displacements. The material law is described by a nonlinear, space-independent elastic tensor depending on both the displacement and the strain, and gives rise to a general class of quasilinear Lamé systems. We prove the unique and stable recovery of a wide class of space-independent nonlinear elastic tensors, including the identification of two nonlinear isotropic Lamé moduli as well as certain anisotropic tensors. The boundary measurements are assumed to be available at a finite number of boundary points and, in the isotropic case, at a single point. Moreover, the measurements are generated by boundary displacements belonging to an explicit class of affine functions. The analysis is based on structural properties of nonlinear Lamé systems, including asymptotic expansions of the boundary stress and tensorial calculus.

### [12] [Convergence to shock profiles for Burgers equation with singular fast-diffusion and boundary effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15900)
*Xiaowen Li,Ming Mei*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper studies asymptotic stability of viscous shock profiles for a Burgers equation with fast diffusion on a half-space, addressing singularities at u=0 and boundary layer effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand long-time behavior of solutions to a Burgers equation with fast diffusion (1/2<m<1) on a half-space with boundary conditions u(0)=u_->0 and u(∞)=0. The key challenges are the singularity in diffusivity at u=0 and boundary layer effects that complicate stability analysis.

Method: The authors introduce new techniques for weighted energy estimates to overcome the singularity from fast diffusion compounded by boundary layer effects. They analyze convergence to a shifted shock profile U(x-st-d(t)), where d(t) is governed by boundary layer dynamics at x=0 and driven by initial data.

Result: The main result demonstrates that the long-time behavior of u converges to a shifted shock profile U(x-st-d(t)), with d(t) determined by boundary layer dynamics at x=0 and initial data. The analysis successfully handles the singular diffusivity and boundary layer challenges.

Conclusion: The paper establishes asymptotic stability of viscous shock profiles for the Burgers equation with fast diffusion on a half-space, developing novel weighted energy estimate techniques to address the combined challenges of singular diffusivity and boundary layer effects.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of viscous shock profile for the Burgers equation $u_t +f(u)_x = (\frac{u_{x}}{u^{1-m}})_x$ on the half-space $(0,+\infty)$, subject to the boundary conditions $u|_{x=0}=u_->0$ and $u|_{x=+\infty}=0$. Here, the parameter $\frac{1}{2}<m<1$ measures the strength of fast diffusion. A key challenge arises from the pronounced singularity in the diffusivity $\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}} \right)_x$ at $u=0$ and the boundary layer. We demonstrate that the long-time behavior of $u$ converges to a shifted shock profile $U(x-st-d(t))$, where $d(t)$ is governed by the boundary layer dynamics at $x=0$ and driven by the initial data $u(x,0)$. To overcome the singularity from fast diffusion compounded by the bad effect of boundary layer for wave stability, some new techniques for weighted energy estimates are introduced artfully.

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper provides new proofs of unboundedness of Riesz operator in L∞ and establishes mild ill-posedness in W¹,∞ for 3D rotating Euler and 2D Euler with partial damping, plus instability results for 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ill-posedness issues in fluid equations, particularly for rotating Euler equations in W¹,∞ without using vorticity formulation, and to extend instability analysis to other geophysical fluid systems.

Method: First presents a new simple proof of Riesz operator unboundedness in L∞, then uses this to establish mild ill-posedness in W¹,∞ for 3D rotating Euler and 2D Euler with partial damping, and applies similar techniques to prove instability for 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system.

Result: Established mild ill-posedness in W¹,∞ for 3D rotating Euler equations and 2D Euler with partial damping, and proved instability of perturbations for 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system in W¹,∞.

Conclusion: The work provides the first ill-posedness analysis for rotating Euler equations in W¹,∞ without vorticity formulation, demonstrating fundamental limitations in regularity for these fluid systems and establishing connections between Riesz operator properties and instability phenomena in geophysical flows.

Abstract: In this paper, we first present a new and simple proof of unboundedness of Riesz operator in $L^\infty$ and then establish the mild ill-posedness in $W^{1,\infty}$ of 3D rotating Euler equations and 2D Euler equations with partial damping. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one addressing the ill-posedness issue on the rotating Euler equations in $W^{1,\infty}$ without the vorticity formulation. As a further application, we prove the instability of perturbations for the 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system in $W^{1,\infty}$.

### [14] [Real-Time Inviscid Fluid Dynamics and Aero-acoustics on a Sphere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15982)
*Madhusraba Sinha,Jan Stratmann*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Real-time fluid simulation and sound generation on spherical surfaces using Closest Point Method and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings analogy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces has applications in weather visualization, games, and VR, but conventional methods struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities and lack stable high-order accuracy.

Method: Combines Closest Point Method (CPM) for solving surface PDEs in Cartesian embedding without parametrization, projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy for aeroacoustics. Uses signed distance functions for obstacles and hysteresis smoothing for artifact suppression.

Result: Simulates inviscid fluid behavior on spherical surfaces while generating sound from surface pressure forces, offering stability, geometric consistency, and supporting applications in scientific visualization, VR, and education.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for stable real-time fluid simulation and sound generation on spherical surfaces with obstacles, overcoming limitations of conventional grid-based and mesh-based approaches.

Abstract: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.
  Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.
  Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.

### [15] [A sharp criterion and complete classification of global-in-time solutions and finite time blow-up of solutions to a chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15990)
*Yuri Soga*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes sharp threshold phenomena for a chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in supercritical dimensions, identifying critical Morrey norms that separate global existence from finite-time blow-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the long-time behavior of solutions to the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in supercritical dimensions, which cannot be reduced to a single equation like the classical Keller-Segel system.

Method: Using scaling-critical Morrey norms of initial data to establish threshold phenomena, proving existence of singular stationary solutions, and showing their Morrey norm values serve as critical thresholds for solution behavior.

Result: Identified sharp thresholds separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up, discovered new critical exponents, and provided complete classification of long-time behavior for this system in supercritical dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first complete classification of long-time behavior for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in supercritical dimensions, establishing critical thresholds via Morrey norms.

Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in the whole space, \begin{equation}\label{abst:p}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = Δu - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v),\\ 0 = Δv + w,\\ w_t = Δw + u \end{cases} \end{equation} with emphasis on supercritical dimensions. In contrast to the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system, where the analysis can be reduced to a single equation, the above system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and does not admit such a reduction. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold phenomenon separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up in terms of scaling-critical Morrey norms of the initial data. In particular, we prove the existence of singular stationary solutions and show that their Morrey norm values serve as the critical thresholds determining the long-time behavior of solutions. Consequently, we identify new critical exponents at which the long-time behavior of solutions changes. This yields a complete classification of the long-time behavior of solutions, providing the first such results for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system \eqref{abst:p} in supercritical dimensions.

Use nonlinear geometric optics expansion and analyze the leading oscillatory term to determine the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with q(x,u).

Result: The coefficient of amplitude h in the oscillatory part of the geometric optics expansion determines the light-ray transform of a vector field, which uniquely determines q(x,u) in the maximal region determined by the data. Methods work for both scalar equations and systems with null conditions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a connection between oscillatory wave solutions and the underlying nonlinear structure, providing a method to uniquely recover nonlinear coefficients from oscillatory data in semilinear wave equations satisfying null conditions.

Abstract: We construct oscillatory solutions of fully semilinear wave equations in Minkowski space satisfying a null condition of the form $$\square u:=(-\partial_{x_0}^2 +\sum_{j=1}^n \partial_{x_j}^2 )u= q(x,u)((\partial_{x_0}u)^2-|\nabla_{x'}u|^2),$$ $$x=(x_0,x'), \;\ x'=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \text{ and } x_0=t \text{ is the time variable,}$$ on an interval $x_0\in [-T,T]$, $T<\infty$ arbitrary, which consist of the superposition of a non-oscillatory background solution and a single phase train of highly oscillatory waves of wave length $h\ll1$ and amplitudes given by powers of $h$; the waves interact with the nonlinearity and we measure the response $u(x_0,x')|_{x_0=T'}$ at a fixed time $x_0=T'<T$.
  We show that the coefficient of amplitude $h$ of the oscillatory part of the nonlinear geometric optics expansion of the solution determines the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with $q(x,u)$, which determines $q(x,u)$ uniquely in the maximal region determined by the data. Our methods also work for systems of semilinear wave equations satisfying null conditions, but in this paper we focus on the scalar case.

TL;DR: The paper proves that solutions to p-Laplacian equations on random point clouds converge to weighted p-Laplacian PDEs with mixed boundary conditions as sample size increases, providing a new discretization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous mathematical foundations for p-Laplacian-based semi-supervised learning on point clouds, connecting discrete graph-based methods to continuum PDE theory.

Method: Analyze p-Laplacian equations on random point clouds using viscosity solution framework, assuming points are independent samples from a bounded domain, with fixed labeled points as sample size grows.

Result: For p>d, solutions converge to weighted p-Laplacian equation with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, providing a new discretization of p-Laplacian on point clouds.

Conclusion: The work establishes continuum limits for p-Laplacian equations on point clouds, bridging discrete graph methods and PDE theory for semi-supervised learning applications.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of $p$-Laplacian equations on point clouds that arise from hypergraph learning in a semi-supervised setting. Under the assumption that the point clouds consist of independent random samples drawn from a bounded domain $Ω\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the number of data points tends to infinity, with the number of labeled points remains fixed. We show, for any $p>d$ in the viscosity solution framework, that the continuum limit is a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation subject to mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The result provides a new discretization of the $p$-Laplacian on point clouds.

*Zhibin Wang,Jiahong Wu,Ning Zhu*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: This paper solves the stability and large-time behavior problem for 2D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with fractional dissipation in only one direction, covering all fractional exponents 0≤s<1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The stability problem for 2D Navier-Stokes with dissipation in only one direction is not fully understood. This anisotropic dissipation lies between fully dissipative Navier-Stokes (algebraic decay) and inviscid Euler (potential rapid growth), creating a fundamental gap in understanding stability and long-term behavior.

Method: Developed different techniques for different ranges of fractional exponents: 0≤s≤3/4, 3/4<s<11/12, and 11/12≤s<1. For the most difficult case (11/12≤s<1), introduced spatial polynomial A₂ weights and exploited boundedness of Riesz transforms on weighted L²-spaces.

Result: Successfully solved the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation Λ₁²ˢ for all 0≤s<1, with s=1 corresponding to standard one-directional dissipation ∂₁².

Conclusion: The paper provides a complete solution to the stability problem for 2D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations with one-directional fractional dissipation, bridging the gap between fully dissipative and inviscid regimes through innovative mathematical techniques tailored to different fractional exponent ranges.

Abstract: The stability problem for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with dissipation in only one direction on $\mathbb R^2$ is not fully understood. This dissipation is in the intermediate regime between the fully dissipative Navier-Stokes and the inviscid Euler. Navier-Stokes solutions in $\mathbb R^2$ decay algebraically in time while Euler solutions can grow rather rapidly in time. This paper solves the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem on the anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation $Λ_1^{2s}$ for all $0\leq s<1$. The case $s=1$ corresponds to the standard one directional dissipation $\partial_1^2$. Different techniques are developed to treat different ranges of fractional exponents: $0\leq s\leq \frac34$, $\frac34<s<\frac{11}{12}$, and $\frac{11}{12} \leq s <1$. The final range is the most difficult case, for which we introduce the spatial polynomial $A_2$ weights and exploit the boundedness of Riesz transforms on weighted $L^2$-spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous results by Azzam on the dimension drop phenomenon of harmonic measure for domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries, while providing quantitative bounds and using more elementary methods.

Method: Uses elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations instead of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments. Focuses on domains with uniformly non-flat boundaries and dimensional Ahlfors regularity.

Result: Successfully extends Azzam's dimension drop results for harmonic measure, provides quantitative bounds on the δ₀ parameter, and establishes results for domains with boundaries of dimension s where n-1-δ₀ ≤ s ≤ n-1.

Conclusion: The paper provides an alternative, more elementary approach to studying harmonic measure dimension drop, yielding quantitative results for domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We extend earlier results of Azzam on the dimension drop of the harmonic measure for a domain $Ω\subset \R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$, with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundary $\partialΩ$ of dimension $s$ with $n-1-δ_0 \leq s\leq n-1$, that is uniformly non flat. Here $δ_0$ is a small positive constant dependent on the parameters of the problem. Our novel construction relies on elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations. We avoid the use of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments, and also give quantitative bounds on the $δ_0$ parameter.

*Alix Deleporte,Jean Lagacé,Marc Rouveyrol*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper establishes an equivalence between L² norms on a Riemannian manifold and its subsets for spectrally localized functions, with constants independent of injectivity radius.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how L² norms of spectrally localized functions on Riemannian manifolds relate to their restrictions on subsets, particularly when the manifold has bounded sectional curvature but potentially small injectivity radius.

Method: Uses spectral projector techniques on Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature. The analysis focuses on functions in the range of a spectral projector and establishes norm equivalence between the full manifold and subsets satisfying an optimal thickness condition.

Result: Shows equivalence between L² norms on the manifold and on subsets with thickness condition for spectrally localized functions. The constant depends only on dimension, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold, but crucially not on injectivity radius.

Conclusion: For spectrally localized functions on manifolds with bounded curvature, L² norm equivalence holds between the full manifold and sufficiently thick subsets, with constants independent of injectivity radius, establishing optimal thickness conditions.

Abstract: Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ endowed with a smooth metric $g$ satisfying upper and lower sectional curvature bounds, we show an equivalence property between the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on $M$ and the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on subsets $ω$ satisfying a thickness condition, for functions in the range of a spectral projector. The thickness condition is known to be optimal in this setting. The constant appearing in the equivalence of norms property depends only on the dimension of the manifold, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold of the spectral cutoff, but, crucially, not on the injectivity radius.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The first Pohozaev identity for non-local operators was established for Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL) in 2014, but Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL) differs fundamentally and requires a new approach since the RFL integration by parts strategy cannot be applied.

Method: Develops a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure. The main result expresses the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix that depends on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the fractional exponent.

Result: Successfully proves a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian, which allows establishing non-existence results for the semilinear Dirichlet problem $(-Δ|_Ω)^su = f(u)$ in star-shaped domains.

Conclusion: The paper provides a fundamental tool (Pohozaev identity) for analyzing semilinear problems involving Spectral Fractional Laplacian, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches for Restricted Fractional Laplacian through a novel spectral method.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL). This identity allows us to establish non-existence results for the semilinear Dirichlet problem $(-Δ|_Ω)^su = f(u)$ in star-shaped domains. The first such identity for non-local operators was established by Ros-Oton and Serra in 2014 for the Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL). However, the SFL differs fundamentally from the RFL, and the integration by parts strategy of Ros-Oton and Serra cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure. Our main result expresses the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix that depends on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the fractional exponent.

*Alex Alberts,Akshay Jacob Thomas,Kamran Daryabeigi,Ilias Bilionis*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: Bayesian framework using information field theory reconstructs thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse data, enabling accurate TPS design in extreme entry conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spacecraft thermal protection systems require accurate thermal conductivity data at extreme temperatures encountered during atmospheric entry, but conventional lab measurements are limited to lower temperatures and often only temperature data is available, requiring indirect inference.

Method: Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) where conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, with physics enforced via physics-informed prior over temperature derived from heat equation, producing infinite-dimensional posterior distribution quantifying uncertainty.

Result: Method applied to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with synthetic and experimental data successfully reconstructs thermal conductivity beyond experimental regime, validated against reference data and propagated into high-fidelity digital twins for Mars and Earth entry trajectories.

Conclusion: IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust thermal protection system sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement, addressing critical gap in spacecraft TPS design.

Abstract: The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current equivariant architectures for interatomic potentials rely on Clebsch-Gordan tensor products that create a trade-off between accuracy and speed, limiting practical applications of atomistic simulations.

Method: Geodite replaces tensor products with an equivariant message-passing architecture that incorporates physical priors to ensure smooth potential energy surfaces, trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset.

Result: Geodite-MP achieves competitive accuracy on materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon properties, and molecular dynamics benchmarks while running 3-5× faster than similarly performing models.

Conclusion: Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening by combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, overcoming previous computational limitations.

Abstract: Foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for atomistic simulations, promising near first-principles accuracy across diverse chemical spaces at a fraction of the cost of quantum-mechanical calculations. However, the most accurate equivariant architectures rely on Clebsch-Gordan tensor products whose computational cost scales steeply with angular resolution, creating a trade-off between model expressiveness and inference speed that ultimately limits practical applications. Here we introduce Geodite, an equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces tensor products while incorporating physical priors to ensure smooth, well-behaved potential energy surfaces. Trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset of inorganic crystals, Geodite-MP achieves accuracy competitive with leading methods on benchmarks for materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon-derived properties, and nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics, while running $3\text{--}5\times$ faster than models performing similarly. By combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.

TL;DR: ConvLSTM neural network developed as spatiotemporal surrogate for expensive mesoscale simulations of shock propagation in granular materials, enabling faster parameter exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mesoscale hydrocodes for granular materials under impact are computationally expensive, limiting parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. Need for faster surrogate models to explore parameter space.

Method: Developed convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) neural network as sequence-to-sequence model trained on 2D hydrocode simulation data. Tested on "billiard break" problem (cue ball impacting cluster) and applied to published mesoscale shock compaction simulations.

Result: Compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately predicts pressure wave propagation and particle motion for unseen impact conditions. Captures compaction front position/shape dependence on impact speed, though smooths fine pore-scale details in compacted regions.

Conclusion: ConvLSTM models serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated parameter exploration and laying groundwork for physics-informed mesoscale simulations.

Abstract: Granular materials subjected to impact loading exhibit highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics governed by wave propagation, pore collapse, and grain-scale rearrangements. Mesoscale hydrocodes resolve these processes but are computationally expensive, limiting their use in parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we develop a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network as a spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of weak shock propagation in granular media. Using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations as training data, we first consider a simplified "billiard break" problem in which a cue ball impacts a cluster of nine circular balls, all deformable. Sequences of pressure-field images serve as input-output pairs for a sequence-to-sequence ConvLSTM, which is trained to predict future frames from a short history. We compare several architectures and show that a relatively compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces the propagation of the pressure wave and the resulting particle motion for an unseen combination of cue-ball position and impact velocity. As a proof-of-concept extension, we apply the same ConvLSTM framework to previously published mesoscale simulations of weak shock compaction in a granular ensemble. When evaluated at piston impact speeds that were completely withheld from training, the surrogate captures the position and shape of the compaction front and its dependence on impact speed, while smoothing fine pore-scale details in the highly compacted region as expected. These results demonstrate that ConvLSTM models can serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated exploration of parameter space and laying the groundwork for physics-informed, mesoscale simulations of granular materials under shock loading.

TL;DR: A unified scaling theory for ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence in fusion devices that predicts distinct heat flux scalings (cubic for electrons, linear for ions) based on parallel system scale and outer-scale aspect ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turbulent transport is a major obstacle in fusion confinement. Current predictive models are either too expensive (gyrokinetic simulations) or rely on data fitting, limiting their utility for reactor design. There's a need for physics-based, fast transport models.

Method: Developed a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence by balancing fundamental time scales (linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, parallel propagation). The theory isolates heat flux dependence to two key parameters: parallel system scale and outer-scale aspect ratio.

Result: Theory predicts distinct scalings: cubic with temperature gradient for ETG transport, linear for ITG transport. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm these predictions across different magnetic geometries (slab, tokamak, stellarator), including first numerical confirmation of cubic ETG scaling.

Conclusion: The framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimization in both tokamaks and stellarators by isolating dependence on just two key parameters.

Abstract: Turbulent transport remains one of the principal obstacles to achieving efficient magnetic confinement in fusion devices. Two of the dominant drivers of the turbulence are microscale instabilities fuelled by electron- and ion-temperature gradients (ETG and ITG), whose nonlinear saturation determines the cross-field transport of particles and energy. Despite decades of study, predictive modelling of this turbulence has been limited either to expensive gyrokinetic simulations or to reduced models calibrated by fitting to numerical or experimental data, restricting their utility for reactor design. Here we present a simple asymptotic scaling theory that unifies ETG- and ITG-driven turbulence within a common framework. By balancing the fundamental time scales of linear growth, nonlinear decorrelation, and parallel propagation, the theory isolates the dependence of the heat flux on equilibrium parameters to two key quantities: the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio. We show that these quantities encapsulate the essential physics of saturation, leading to distinct predictions for ETG and ITG transport: a cubic scaling with the temperature gradient in the electron channel, and a linear scaling in the ion channel. Extensive nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations confirm that these theoretical predictions hold irrespective of the magnetic geometry (slab, tokamak, or stellarator), including the first numerical confirmation of the cubic ETG scaling anticipated by earlier theory. By isolating the dependence on just the parallel system scale and the outer-scale aspect ratio, our framework provides a physics-based foundation for fast, geometry-aware transport models, offering a pathway toward reactor optimisation in both tokamaks and stellarators.

Motivation: The density limit disruption in tokamak plasmas remains an unresolved barrier to achieving high-density plasma needed for nuclear fusion energy gain. Understanding and overcoming this limit is crucial for future fusion reactors.

Method: Conducted high-density experiments on HL-2A tokamak using conventional gas-puff fueling in NBI and Ohmically heated plasmas. Used simulation analysis to identify the nature of observed MHD instabilities.

Result: First discovery of multiple-branch MHD instabilities in core plasmas when density exceeds 85% of Greenwald density. These are identified as Alfvénic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes that trigger minor or major disruptions in peaked-density plasmas.

Conclusion: These findings provide crucial insights into the origin of density limit disruptions, offering pathways to forecast and avoid them in future fusion reactors, which is essential for achieving high-density plasma conditions needed for practical fusion energy.

Abstract: To achieve a high energy gain, the fusion reactor plasma must reach a very high density. However, the tokamak plasmas ofen undergo disruption when the density exceeds the Greenwald density. The density limit disruption in tokamak plasmas is a mysterious barrier to magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, and hitherto, is still an unresolved issue. Over the past several years, the high density experiments with Greenwald density ratio $n_e/n_{eG}\sim1$ has been carried out using the conventional gas-puff fuelling method in HL-2A NBI and Ohmically heated plasmas. It is found for the first time that there are multiple-branch MHD instabilities in the core plasmas while $n_e/n_{eG}>0.85$. The simulation analysis suggests that the core-localized magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) activities belong to Alfv${é}$nic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes, and on experiment firstly, it is discovered that they trigger the minor or major disruption of bulk plasmas while the density is peaked. These new findings are of great importance to figure out and understand the origin of density limit disruptions, as well as to forecast and avoid them for future fusion rectors.

Result: Achieved high density plasmas lasting ~500ms (~30τ_E) and discovered for the first time core-localized kinetic MHD instabilities (AITG modes or KBM) that trigger minor/major disruptions when density profile is peaked.

Conclusion: These findings provide crucial experimental evidence linking core-localized kinetic MHD instabilities to density limit disruptions, advancing understanding of the fundamental density limit mechanism in fusion plasmas.

Abstract: The density limit is a mysterious barrier to magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, and is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we will present the experimental results of the density limit and core-localized kinetic MHD instabilities on HL-2A. Firstly, the high density shots with $ne/ne_G>1$ have been achieved by the conventional gas-puff fuelling method in Ohmic heating plasmas, and the corresponding duration time is close to $t\sim500$ ms ($\sim$ $30τ_E$), where $τ_E$ is the global energy confinement time. Secondly, it is found for the first time that there are kinetic MHD instabilities in the core plasmas while $ne/ne_G\sim1$. The analysis suggests that the core-localized MHD activities belong to Alfv{é}nic ion temperature gradient (AITG) modes or kinetic ballooning modes (KBM), and firstly it is found on experiment that they trigger the minor or major disruption of bulk plasmas while the density profile is peaked.

TL;DR: A kinetic-moment framework using PIC/MCC simulations to analyze electron energy dynamics in low-pressure capacitively coupled plasmas, revealing localized energy conversion and nonlocal transport mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron energy dynamics (absorption, conversion, transport, dissipation) in low-temperature plasmas like CCPs is crucial for interpreting discharge physics and process applications, but requires quantitative, self-consistent descriptions that bridge kinetic and fluid perspectives.

Method: Proposed a kinetic-moment framework based on PIC/MCC simulations that reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from simulation data. Separated total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations, and decomposed pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation.

Result: At low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is transported into the bulk and dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. Pressure-strain decomposition reveals significant thermalization beyond collisions, showing coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near sheath and nonlocal energy transport dominated by microscopic heat flux that deviates from Fourier's law.

Conclusion: The framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity, offering a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas by revealing complex energy conversion and transport mechanisms that combine localized processes with nonlocal transport.

Abstract: Understanding electron energy dynamics in low-temperature plasmas such as capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs), including energy absorption, conversion, transport, and dissipation, is essential for interpreting discharge physics and process applications. We propose a kinetic-moment framework based on particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations. The framework reconstructs the first three velocity moments of the Boltzmann equation directly from PIC/MCC data and enables a quantitative, self-consistent description of electron energy dynamics in low-pressure CCPs. To clarify energy conversion among electromagnetic energy, electron fluid kinetic (mechanical) energy, and electron thermal (internal) energy, we further separate the total energy transport equation into kinetic- and thermal-energy equations. We find that, at low pressure, electrons gain directed kinetic energy in the sheath and convert it locally into thermal energy through pressure-strain interaction and collisions. Thermal energy is then transported into the bulk and is dissipated mainly by inelastic electron-neutral collisions. We further decompose pressure-strain interaction into reversible pressure dilatation and irreversible viscous-like dissipation, which correspond to conversion driven by volumetric compression or expansion and by shear deformation, respectively. This decomposition reveals a significant thermalization channel beyond collisions. More broadly, the results show coexistence of localized kinetic-to-thermal conversion near the sheath and nonlocal energy transport from the sheath to the bulk dominated by microscopic heat flux. The heat flux deviates strongly from Fourier's law based on local temperature gradients. This framework provides a clear fluid description with kinetic fidelity and offers a practical tool for analyzing energy evolution in nonequilibrium plasmas.

### [31] [Non-Ambipolarity of Microturbulent Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15661)
*Allen H Boozer*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: Electrostatic microturbulence creates chaotic magnetic field lines that drive electron transport via quasi-neutrality constraints, producing effective viscosity that can counterbalance non-ambipolar ion diffusion and affect impurity confinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how electrostatic microturbulence-induced magnetic field chaos affects plasma transport, particularly how it creates electron transport that can balance non-ambipolar ion diffusion and influence impurity confinement in fusion plasmas.

Method: Theoretical analysis using quasi-neutrality condition along chaotic magnetic field lines, deriving potential equation and effective diffusion coefficient, then calculating maximum non-ambipolar diffusion that can be counterbalanced and required plasma beta.

Result: Derived electron transport diffusion coefficient D_ef = (Δ/a_T)T_e/eB, showing chaotic magnetic fields produce effective electron viscosity that can balance non-ambipolar ion diffusion, with calculations for maximum f_na and required plasma beta to avoid shielding magnetic perturbations.

Conclusion: Electrostatic microturbulence-induced magnetic field chaos creates significant electron transport that can balance non-ambipolar ion diffusion, affecting radial electric fields and impurity confinement, with important implications for plasma beta requirements in fusion devices.

Abstract: Even what is called electrostatic microturbulence produces a plasma-beta-dependent turbulent magnetic field $\tilde{B}$, which makes the magnetic field lines chaotic. Quasi-neutrality along the chaotic magnetic field lines requires a potential that obeys $\vec{B}\cdot \vec{\nabla} Φ= \vec{B}\cdot \vec{\nabla} p_e$, where $p_e$ is the electron pressure. This potential produces radial transport similar to that of diffusion coefficient $D_{ef}= (Δ/a_T)T_e/eB$. $Δ$ is the radial distance over which the potential $Φ$ is correlated by the electron motion along the chaotic magnetic field, and $|dT_e/dr| = T_e/a_T$. The chaos-produced electron transport gives an effective viscosity on the electron flow, which can counter balance a non-ambipolar part of the ion radial particle diffusion $f_{na}$. This non-ambipolarity would otherwise require a radial electric field that confines ions and hence impurities. The maximum $f_{na}$ that can be counterbalanced and the required plasma beta to avoid shielding the magnetic perturbations $\tilde{B}$ are calculated.

TL;DR: Numerical analysis of 5 finite-difference schemes for 2D supersonic inviscid flows around blunt bodies, focusing on shock wave resolution and identifying scheme-induced non-physical behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different numerical schemes and mesh geometry affect solutions of compressible Euler equations for supersonic inviscid flows, particularly focusing on shock wave resolution capabilities and identifying scheme-induced artifacts.

Method: Comparative study of 5 finite-difference schemes: Beam & Warming implicit approximate factorization, Steger & Warming flux vector splitting, van Leer flux vector splitting, and two novel finite-difference interpretations of Liou AUSM+ scheme. Analysis includes shock structure examination, domain transformation effects, and implementation of freestream subtraction, flux limiting, and artificial dissipation to address numerical issues.

Result: Significant changes in shock structure observed depending on scheme properties and domain transformation. Non-physical upstream perturbations in supersonic flow detected. One AUSM+ formulation proved particularly robust in avoiding numerically-induced disturbances. Good agreement achieved with existing numerical and experimental results.

Conclusion: Numerical schemes and mesh geometry significantly impact supersonic flow solutions, with scheme-specific properties causing both physical shock variations and non-physical artifacts. Careful scheme selection and numerical treatments (freestream subtraction, flux limiting, artificial dissipation) are essential for accurate simulations, with certain AUSM+ formulations showing superior robustness.

Abstract: The effects induced by numerical schemes and mesh geometry on the solution of two-dimensional supersonic inviscid flows are investigated in the context of the compressible Euler equations. Five different finite-difference schemes are considered: the Beam and Warming implicit approximate factorization algorithm, the original Steger and Warming flux vector splitting algorithm, the van Leer approach on performing the flux vector splitting and two different novel finite-difference interpretations of the Liou AUSM+ scheme. Special focus is given to the shock wave resolution capabilities of each scheme for the solution of an external supersonic inviscid flows around a blunt body. Significant changes in the shock structure are observed, mainly due to special properties of the scheme in use and the influence of the domain transformation procedure. Perturbations in the supersonic flow upstream of the shock are also seen in the solution, which is a non-physical behavior. Freestream subtraction, flux limiting and the explicit addition of artificial dissipation are employed in order to circumvent these problems. One of the AUSM+ formulations presented here is seen to be particularly more robust in avoiding the appearance of some of these numerically-induced disturbances and non-physical characteristics in the solution. Good agreement is achieved with both numerical and experimental results available in the literature.}

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Study compares three gradient reconstruction techniques for viscous term calculation in unstructured grid finite volume methods, with novel CFL control rules for convergence acceleration, tested on aerodynamic cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare different gradient reconstruction techniques for viscous term calculation in unstructured grid finite volume methods, and to develop effective convergence acceleration strategies for compressible RANS simulations.

Method: Uses cell-centered finite volume formulation on unstructured grids with compressible RANS equations and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. Compares three gradient reconstruction techniques for viscous terms, Roe solver for inviscid terms, and develops novel CFL control rules based on residue evolution for convergence acceleration.

Result: Simplest gradient reconstruction caused severe instabilities, while sophisticated formulations provided excellent agreement with literature. Aerodynamic forces were mildly dependent on limiter formulation even without shocks. Proposed CFL control effectively drove residues to machine zero when no major instabilities were present.

Conclusion: Gradient reconstruction technique selection is critical for stability and accuracy in viscous flow simulations on unstructured grids. Sophisticated gradient methods outperform simple approaches, and the proposed CFL control rules provide effective convergence acceleration for steady-state solutions.

Abstract: This work primarily focuses on the study of three gradient reconstruction techniques applied to the calculation of viscous terms in a cell-centered, finite volume formulation for general unstructured grids. The work also addresses different ways of formulating the limiter functions necessary to maintain stability in the presence of flow discontinuities. The flows of interest are simulated using the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the negative Spalart-Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. Definition of interface inviscid terms uses the Roe approximate Riemann solver, whereas the interface viscous terms are calculated with a standard centered scheme together with appropriate definitions of the interface gradients. Steady state solutions are obtained using an implicit time-integration method, together with a novel convergence acceleration technique. This new approach defines a set of three simple rules for controlling the global CFL number based on the residue evolution. The work considers three test cases, namely, the subsonic bump-in-channel flow, the subsonic NASA high-lift Common Research Model multielement airfoil and the transonic ONERA M6 wing. Present results are compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature. Severe numerical instabilities are observed when the simplest gradient reconstruction technique is used, while more sophisticated formulations are able to provide excellent agreement with the existing literature. Current results are demonstrated to be highly insensitive to modifications made to the numerical flux entropy fix terms. Integrated aerodynamic forces are shown to be mildly dependent on the limiter formulation used, even in the absence of shock waves. The proposed convergence acceleration procedure manages to quickly drive the residue terms to machine zero, provided no major instabilities are present.

TL;DR: Existence of weak solutions for compressible viscous fluids with stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions of friction type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mathematically rigorous framework for studying compressible viscous fluids driven by stochastic forces with physically relevant slip boundary conditions, which are important in many applications but mathematically challenging.

Method: Combines an extended version of the four-layer approximation scheme on the torus (Breit/Feireisl/Hofmanová, 2018) with the convex approximation method for absolute value functions (Nečasová/Ogorzaly/Scherz, 2023) to handle slip boundary conditions.

Result: Establishes existence of weak solutions for compressible viscous fluids with stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions on bounded domains with C²⁺ᵛ-boundary (ν>0).

Conclusion: Provides a mathematically consistent notion of weak solutions and proves their existence for stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with slip boundary conditions, extending previous results to more physically realistic boundary conditions.

Abstract: We study a mathematical model of a compressible viscous fluid driven by stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions of friction type. We introduce a notion of a weak solution that is analytically and probabilistically consistent with this model. Our main result establishes the existence of such weak solutions under slip boundary conditions on bounded domains with $C^{2+ν}$-boundary ($ν>0$). The proof of this result combines an extended version of the four-layer approximation scheme on the torus by Breit/Feireisl/Hofmanová (2018) with the convex approximation method for absolute value functions studied by Nečasová/Ogorzaly/Scherz (2023).

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Graphyne materials with B-N co-doping show promise for hydrogen evolution reaction catalysis, with ortho-substituted γ-graphyne offering optimal balance between hydrogen adsorption strength and structural stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chemical doping (B, N, B-N) affects graphyne's electronic properties and hydrogen adsorption capabilities for potential HER catalyst applications.

Method: Combined Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics simulations to study pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped γ-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para configurations).

Result: B-N co-doping creates near thermo-neutral hydrogen adsorption sites, with ortho substitution being most favorable. γ-graphyne with B-N ortho doping maintains controlled hydrogen uptake without structural degradation, while other configurations show stability issues.

Conclusion: B-N geometry is a critical design parameter for graphyne-based HER catalysts, requiring both favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy and finite-temperature stability, with B-N ortho in γ-graphyne showing optimal performance.

Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $γ$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $γ$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $π$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $γ$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $ΔG_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.

*Thomas Barthel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TTNS reduce graph distance compared to MPS but MPS remains more efficient for large D>1 systems despite TTNS advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MPS simulations outperform TTNS for large systems in D>1 dimensions despite TTNS having reduced graph distance between physical degrees of freedom.

Method: Analyze computational cost scaling for TTNS vs MPS in D=2 and 3 dimensions under entanglement area law assumption, considering different boundary conditions.

Result: For large systems in D>1, MPS simulations of low-energy states are more efficient than TTNS simulations, despite TTNS having reduced graph distance.

Conclusion: The paper explains the surprising efficiency advantage of MPS over TTNS for large D>1 systems by analyzing scaling of computational costs under area law entanglement.

Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D>1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reproducible, open-source testbed for exploring phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, combining computational performance with high-level flexibility for studying DLA phenomena.

Method: Developed dla-ideal-solver framework using Numba-accelerated Python with JIT compilation for high-performance 2D DLA simulation. Investigated Laplacian growth instability across varying injection geometries and walker concentrations, using mass-radius scaling, generalized Rényi dimensions, and lacunarity metrics.

Result: Confirmed standard fractal dimension Df≈1.71 for dilute regimes (Witten-Sander universality class), but found crossover to Eden-like compact growth (Df≈1.87) in high-density environments due to screening length saturation. The framework achieved computational throughput comparable to legacy static implementations.

Conclusion: The work establishes a reproducible open-source platform for studying non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, revealing density-dependent phase transitions in DLA growth patterns and providing quantitative tools for analyzing fractal character and spatial heterogeneity.

Abstract: We present dla-ideal-solver, a high-performance framework for simulating two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) using Numba-accelerated Python. By leveraging just-in-time (JIT) compilation, we achieve computational throughput comparable to legacy static implementations while retaining high-level flexibility. We investigate the Laplacian growth instability across varying injection geometries and walker concentrations. Our analysis confirms the robustness of the standard fractal dimension $D_f \approx 1.71$ for dilute regimes, consistent with the Witten-Sander universality class. However, we report a distinct crossover to Eden-like compact growth ($D_f \approx 1.87$) in high-density environments, attributed to the saturation of the screening length. Beyond standard mass-radius scaling, we employ generalized Rényi dimensions and lacunarity metrics to quantify the monofractal character and spatial heterogeneity of the aggregates. This work establishes a reproducible, open-source testbed for exploring phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Conclusion: The tensor network framework successfully bridges neural and symbolic AI, offering efficient scaling reasoning algorithms and enabling hybrid logical-probabilistic models through a unified mathematical foundation.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.
