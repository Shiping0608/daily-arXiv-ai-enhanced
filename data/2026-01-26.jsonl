This work aims to compare explicit time integrators for a broad class of phase-field models involving coupling between the phase-field and concentration.

Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss.

However, explicit constructions achieving this optimal linear dependence remain elusive. Recently, Dick and Pillichshammer (2025) made significant progress by showing that a multiset union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets almost achieve the optimal dimension dependence with high probability.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analog of this result in the setting of classical integer arithmetic using Fourier analysis. We analyze point sets constructed as multiset unions of Korobov rank-1 lattice point sets modulo a prime $N$. We provide a comprehensive analysis covering four distinct construction scenarios, combining either random or fixed integer generators with either continuous torus shifts or discrete grid shifts. We prove that in all four cases, the star discrepancy is bounded by a term of order $O(s \\log(N_{tot}) / \\sqrt{N_{tot}})$ with high probability, where $N_{tot}$ is the total number of points. This implies that the inverse of the star discrepancy for these structured sets depends quadratically on the dimension $s$. While the proofs are probabilistic, our results significantly reduce the search space for optimal point sets from a continuum to a finite set of candidates parameterized by integer generators and random shifts."}

These limitations persist in Riemann problem-based ghost fluid methods. To address these challenges, we developed a novel spatiotemporal coupling high-resolution ghost fluid method featuring two key advancements: 1) Integration of nonlinear geometrical optics to properly account for thermodynamic entropy evolution. 2) Implementation of the Lax-Wendroff/Cauchy-Kowalevski approach to incorporate tangential fluxes and source term effects.

Using semiclassical simulations that self-consistently combine Maxwell's equations with quantum molecular dynamics, we show that collective electronic Rabi oscillations coherently drive nuclear motion. This effect is captured using both vibrational wave-packet dynamics in a minimal two-level model and atomistic simulations based on time-dependent density-functional tight-binding with Ehrenfest dynamics. Vibrational activation depends non-monotonically on the Rabi frequency and is maximized when the collective polaritonic splitting resonates with a molecular vibrational mode.

Our framework requires only a single training run, circumventing the need for costly re-training for each new parameter instance. Its versatility is demonstrated through two representations of spatially heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields: a direct analytical form and a novel data-driven formulation resting on an autoencoder to create a low-dimensional latent encoding. A key innovation is the integration of the differentiable decoder into the physics-informed loss function, enabling on-the-fly reconstruction of complex conductivity fields via automatic differentiation.

To address this, this work proposes an Operator Splitting Method (OSM) based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to decouple the geometric interface evolution from the physical field reconstruction. Within a predictor-corrector framework, the method splits the coupled system into an alternating sequence of two linear and convex subproblems: solving the diffusion equation on fixed subdomains and updating the interface geometry based on the Stefan condition. A key contribution is the formulation of both steps as linear least-squares problems; this transforms the computational strategy from a non-convex gradient-based optimization into a stable fixed-point iteration composed of alternating convex solvers. From a theoretical perspective, the relaxed iterative operator is shown to be locally contractive, and its fixed points are consistent with stationary points of the coupled residual functional. Benchmarks across 1D to 3D domains demonstrate the stability and high accuracy of the method, confirming that the proposed framework provides a highly accurate and efficient numerical solution for free boundary problems."}

We identify the Fourier symbol of the DtN operator and show it coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian, which yields an explicit Fourier-multiplier representation and allows construction of the corresponding fundamental solution. Using this representation we express the surface velocity as a convolution of the fundamental solution with the interfacial curvature forcing and analyze its normal limit to derive a boundary integral equation for the moving curve.

To avoid the surge of spurious oscillations in the discrete solution, a limiter function is commonly employed. This strategy, however, can add a series of drawbacks to the overall numerical scheme. The present paper investigates this behavior by considering three different limiter formulations in the context of a second-order, finite volume scheme for the simulation of steady, turbulent flows on unstructured meshes. Three limiter formulations are considered: the original Venkatakrishnan limiter, Wang's modification to the Venkatakrishnan limiter and Nishikawa's recently introduced R3 limiter. Three different configurations of the fully-developed, two-dimensional, transonic NACA 0012 airfoil are analyzed, configured with different angles of attack and similar freestream properties. The gas dynamics are modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, where the negative Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is used to solve the closure problem. All limiters are shown to yield similar results for all configurations of this case, although with different dissipative characteristics, provided their control constants are used within appropriate intervals. The presented numerical results are in good agreement with experimental data available in the literature."}

This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional Hénon map, and a forced pendulum."}

The method is derived from the approach of spectral deferred corrections and the idea of enforcing the algebraic constraints without numerical integration as in the approach of $\\varepsilon$-embedding in Hairer and Wanner (1996). It enforces the algebraic constraints to be satisfied in each iteration and allows an efficient solve of semi-explicit DAEs with high-accuracy. The proposed scheme is compared with other DAE methods. We demonstrate that the proposed SDC scheme is competitive with Runge-Kutta methods for DAEs in terms of accuracy and its parallelized versions are very efficient in comparison to other SDC methods."}

All these planetary bodies are embedded in the gaseous embrace of their native protoplanetary disks, and their interactions with the disk gas play a central role in shaping their dynamical evolution and the outcomes of planet formation. These factors make realistic planet formation simulations extremely computationally demanding, which in turn means that accurately modeling the formation of planetary systems requires the use of high-performance methods. The planet formation code Mercury-Ar$χ$es was developed to address these challenges and, since its first implementation, has been used in multiple exoplanetary and Solar System studies. Mercury-Ar$χ$es is a parallel n-body code that builds on the widely used Mercury code and is capable of modeling the growth and migration of forming planets, the interactions between planetary bodies and the disk gas, as well as the evolving impact flux of planetesimals on forming planets across the different stages of their formation process. In this work we provide the up-to-date overview of its physical modeling capabilities and the first detailed description of its high-performance implementation based on the OpenMP directive-based parallelism for shared memory environments, to harness the multi-thread and vectorization features of modern processor architectures."}

This DD solver, called Generalized Optimized Schwarz Method (GOSM), is a substructuring method, that is, the unknowns of an iteration are associated with the subdomains interfaces. We extend the analysis presented in a previous paper of one of the author to a fully discrete setting. We do not consider only a specific set of boundary conditions, but a whole class including, e.g., Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. Our analysis will also cover interface conditions corresponding to a Finite Element Method - Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) coupling. In particular, we shall focus on three classical FEM-BEM couplings, namely the Costabel, Johnson-Nédélec and Bielak-MacCamy couplings. As a remarkable outcome, the present contribution yields well-posed substructured formulations of these classical FEM-BEM couplings for wavenumbers different from classical spurious resonances. We also establish an explicit relation between the dimensions of the kernels of the initial variational formulation, the local problems and the substructured formulation. That relation especially holds for any wavenumber for the substructured formulation of Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, which allows us to prove that the latter formulation is well-posed even at spurious resonances. Besides, we introduce a systematically geometrically convergent iterative method for the Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, with estimates on the convergence speed."}

Although full-wave numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM) or the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) provide high accuracy, their computational cost often hinders rapid parametric studies. Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \\((σ_{dipolar})\\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincaré surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths. Retardation effects are incorporated through the modified long-wavelength approximation (MLWA), extending accuracy into the weakly retarded regime. The resulting framework provides a valuable tool for fast modelling and optimization of plasmonic nanoparticles at a significant lesser computational cost than BEM, DDA, and other standard tools."}

The underlying framework of dissipation-based weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) stabilization for high-order CG and DG approximations was introduced in our previous work. In this general framework, Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstructions are used to calculate local smoothness sensors that determine the appropriate amount of artificial viscosity for each cell. In the original version, candidate polynomials for WENO averaging are constructed using the derivative data from von Neumann neighbors. We upgrade this standard `cell-cell' reconstruction procedure by using WENO polynomials associated with mesh vertices as candidate polynomials for cell-based WENO averaging. The Hermite data of individual cells is sent to vertices of those cells, after which vertex-averaged HWENO data is sent back to cells containing the vertices. The new `cell-vertex' averaging procedure includes the data of vertex neighbors without explicitly adding them to the reconstruction stencils. It mitigates mesh imprinting and can also be used in classical HWENO limiters for DG methods. The second main novelty of the proposed approach is a quadrature-driven distribution of artificial viscosity within high-order finite elements. Replacing the linear quadrature weights by their nonlinear WENO-type counterparts, we concentrate shock-capturing dissipation near discontinuities while minimizing it in smooth portions of troubled cells. This redistribution of WENO stabilization preserves the total dissipation rate within each cell and improves local shock resolution without relying on subcell decomposition techniques. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness for high-order elements."}

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings."}

MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process.

While trivial maps such as translations and reflections exist, we formulate and solve the Non-Trivial Minimal Graph Transformation Problem, governed by a coupled system of partial differential equations. A central result establishes the rigorous equivalence of this original system to a modified problem for a harmonic function. Through a complex variable approach and a weakening technique, the analysis is reduced to solving a fundamental ordinary differential equation parameterized by a real constant k. The explicit integration of this ordinary differential equation involves various elliptic integrals and identities of elliptic functions. Solving the ordinary differential equation for the three cases: when the constant k equals zero, when k is greater than zero, and when k is less than zero yields the full classification of all admissible surfaces and their associated transformations. This process yields several classes of minimal surfaces that, to the best of the author's knowledge, constitute new families of minimal surfaces."}
