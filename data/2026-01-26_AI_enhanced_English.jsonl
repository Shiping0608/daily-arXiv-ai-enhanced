This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology.

In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping.

In this general framework, Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstructions are used to calculate local smoothness sensors that determine the appropriate amount of artificial viscosity for each cell. In the original version, candidate polynomials for WENO averaging are constructed using the derivative data from von Neumann neighbors. We upgrade this standard `cell-cell' reconstruction procedure by using WENO polynomials associated with mesh vertices as candidate polynomials for cell-based WENO averaging. The Hermite data of individual cells is sent to vertices of those cells, after which vertex-averaged HWENO data is sent back to cells containing the vertices. The new `cell-vertex' averaging procedure includes the data of vertex neighbors without explicitly adding them to the reconstruction stencils. It mitigates mesh imprinting and can also be used in classical HWENO limiters for DG methods. The second main novelty of the proposed approach is a quadrature-driven distribution of artificial viscosity within high-order finite elements. Replacing the linear quadrature weights by their nonlinear WENO-type counterparts, we concentrate shock-capturing dissipation near discontinuities while minimizing it in smooth portions of troubled cells.
