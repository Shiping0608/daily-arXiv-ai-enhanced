Based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a physics-guided Curriculum Learning Identification via PINNs (CLIP) method is introduced in this work, for joint parameter inference and hidden state reconstruction. Leveraging the physical separability of RD systems, the CLIP training progresses from reaction-dominated regimes to full spatiotemporal dynamics using curriculum learning and an anchored widening transfer strategy. Across three canonical reaction-diffusion benchmarks, CLIP achieves more accurate and robust identification than baseline methods. Furthermore, the CLIP framework is successfully applied to infer the dynamics of Min system in bacteria, where only membrane bound species are observed and key kinetic rates span multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, ablation experiments and loss landscape analyses provide mechanistic evidence that the curriculum stages and anchored transfer enhance trainability and convergence."}

In this limit, the corresponding eigenvalues become degenerate, with multiplicity two. The nodal deficiency, defined as the difference between the eigenvalue index and the nodal domain count, is known by the Courant nodal domain theorem to be nonnegative. We show that, for small neck widths, the nodal deficiencies of the dumbbell eigenfunctions are no smaller than the nodal deficiencies of the limiting eigenfunctions in the ends, and we provide conditions under which equality is achieved. As a consequence, we establish a criterion for identifying eigenfunctions of zero nodal deficiency for the dumbbell domain."}

Such materials are not only highly nonlinear but also display intrinsic stochasticity arising from their complex and heterogeneous microstructure. Despite recent advances in data-driven constitutive modeling, most existing approaches remain deterministic and fail to quantify predictive uncertainty, thereby limiting their reliability in downstream mechanical analyses. In this work, we propose a probabilistic, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for anisotropic soft materials that explicitly accounts for uncertainty through conformalized quantile regression applied to tensor-valued fields. The proposed framework is built upon a strain-invariant, polyconvex formulation that ensures thermodynamic consistency and promotes robust predictive performance, including in extrapolative regimes. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity: it can be applied in a plug-and-play manner to endow existing deterministic models with probabilistic predictions, while remaining distribution-free and requiring no assumptions on the underlying data distribution. Moreover, the method is straightforward to train, scalable to models with a large number of parameters, and avoids Monte Carlo sampling at inference, making it computationally efficient and well suited for uncertainty propagation in large-scale mechanical simulations. The proposed method is validated using several benchmark datasets synthesized and collected from the literature."}

Here, we address this challenge by focusing on the periodic steady state and solving the resulting problem using the frequency domain general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The key idea of GSIS is to simultaneously solve the mesoscopic kinetic equation and the macroscopic synthetic equation. The kinetic equation provides high-order constitutive relations, beyond those given by the Newton law of viscosity and the Fourier law of heat conduction, to the synthetic equation. In turn, the synthetic equation, which converges to the periodic steady state much faster than the kinetic equation, boosts the evolution of the kinetic equation toward the periodic steady state. As a result, super convergence is achieved, together with an asymptotic preserving property that allows the use of coarse spatial grids. The analytical Fourier stability analysis and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, together with challenging numerical simulations, are employed to demonstrate the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, revealing that it can be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional kinetic schemes in near continuum flow regimes."}

Two hybrid CR models are developed for helium, lithium, and beryllium, retaining detailed fine-structure states up to selected principal quantum numbers, while higher-lying states are statistically averaged to form superconfigurations. These models are applied to compute radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states, across a wide range of electron temperatures and densities.

Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems."}

The plasma exhibited a bright emission that persisted for up to 30--40 us after breakdown, followed by a very weak glow lasting up to 19 ms.

Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $π$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition."}

We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence.

Motivated by the new perspective, we also present a new convergence improvement strategy for the Ensemble Kalman Inversion Algorithm (EnKI), which is an iterative version of the EnKF for inverse problems. In particular, we propose an adaptive multiplicative correction to the sample covariance matrix at each iteration and we call this new algorithm as EnKI-MC (I). Based on the new duality perspective, we derive an expression for the optimal correction factor at each iteration of the EnKI algorithm to accelerate the convergence. In addition, we also consider an ensemble specific multiplicative covariance correction strategy (EnKI-MC (II)) where a different correction is employed for each ensemble. By viewing EnKI through the lens of fixed-point iteration, we also provide theoretical results that guarantees the convergence of EnKI-MC (I) algorithm. Numerical investigations for the deconvolution problem, initial condition inversion in advection-convection problem, initial condition inversion in a Lorenz 96 model, and inverse problem constrained by elliptic partial differential equation are conducted to verify the non-asymptotic results for EnKF and to assess the performance of convergence improvement strategies for EnKI. The numerical results suggest that the proposed strategies for EnKI not only led to faster convergence in comparison to the currently employed techniques but also better quality solutions at termination of the algorithm."}

This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders. We also identify possible physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these differences."}

While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas."}

The direct-line method demonstrates rapid convergence of the semi-discrete eigenvalues towards the exact eigenvalues of the elliptic operator, thereby naturally capturing the singularities. We also establish optimal error estimates for the proposed method. Especially, our method can handle multiple singular point problems in general regions, which are difficult to deal with by most methods. On the other hand, the inverse elasticity problem is constructed as a energy functional minimization problem with total variational regularization, we use the aforementioned method as a forward solver to reconstruct the lamé coefficient of multiple singular points in general regions. Our method can simultaneously deduce heterogeneous $μ$ and $λ$ between different materials. Through numerical experiments on three forward and inverse problems, we systematically verified the accuracy and reliability of this method to solve forward and inverse elastic problems in general domains with multiple singularities."}

They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light."}

The Palais-Smale condition fails to hold in this case. Especially under the hypothesis (V2), the lack of compactness occurs at the interaction between nonlinear term and continuum spectrum. For this reason, we introduce a bootstrap iteration approach for elliptic equation on RN. The iteration is self-contained and can be regarded as a generalization of Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg theorem. The proof characterizes iteration steps independent of the choice of the parameter, which are indeed manipulated by intrinsic natures of potentials and nonlinear terms, and furthermore presents precise estimates for asymptotically linear functions or continuous nonlinear terms restricted on a bounded domain in RN. Additionally, a comparison theorem for the spectrum of Schrodinger operator is also established in this paper. With above preparations, we can get a nontrivial solution without mountain pass geometry, and more importantly make an explicit description of nondegeneracy of solutions with monotonicity hypothesis."}

Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures."}

The analysis is based on a Liouville-type rigidity theorem characterizing solutions that remain localized near a soliton trajectory.\n  A central feature of the proof is a complete spectral resolution of the linearized CH operator around a soliton. This linear theory is obtained via the bi-Hamiltonian and integrable structure of the CH equation, through the recursion operator and the completeness of the associated squared eigenfunctions. It provides a substitute for the classical spectral framework used in KdV and gKdV equations, which is unavailable in the nonlocal and variable-coefficient setting of CH.\n  The spectral resolution yields sharp decay estimates for the linearized flow in exponentially weighted spaces, which in turn lead to the nonlinear rigidity result and the asymptotic stability of a single soliton. Combined with known orbital stability results, this approach extends to well-ordered trains of solitons and to the explicit multi-soliton solutions generated by the inverse scattering method.

Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems."}

In this setup, the fluid on top is heavier and more viscous than the fluid below. Under the effect of gravity, this system becomes unstable, and finger-like structures appear. The phenomenon is described mathematically by coupling Darcy's law with a convection-diffusion reaction equation. The nonlinearity in this model arises mainly from the concentration dependence of viscosity and the convective transport term. The existence of a unique pair of weak solutions is shown in both two and three dimensions using the Galerkin approximation method and truncation technique. Moreover, an application of the maximum principle shows non-negativity of the concentration. Additionally, we analyze the long-time behavior of the solution and prove that the concentration converges exponentially to zero in the $L^p$-norm for all $1 \\le p \\le \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty.$ To complement the theoretical analysis, we perform numerical simulations based on a pressure formulation. By tracking total kinetic energy and mixing measures over time, we discuss the instability and the mixing efficiency, respectively. The present study reveals that although increasing the density contrast amplifies the total kinetic energy, the marginal impact diminishes with successive increments of density contrast. Similarly, while adsorption acts to suppress mixing, its efficiency in doing so tends to saturate with further increases. These non-linear sensitivities are predicted by our theoretical estimates and confirmed by the numerical simulations."}

Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation."}

High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers."}

We use the abstract theory of (nonlinear) semigroups generated by subgradients of proper, lower semicontinuous and convex functionals on Hilbert spaces to build a rigorous and applicable framework that works for many classical elliptic operators but also nonlocal or sometimes fractional operators. After recalling the notion of a nonlinear semigroup generated by subgradients and $j$-subgradients of the associated energy functions, we introduce a general class of (nonlinear) nonlocal elliptic type operators and define rigorously subgradients and $j$-subgradients of such functionals that generate (nonlinear) submarkovian semigroups and hence, the abstract Cauchy problem associated with these subgradients and/or $j$-subgradients is wellposed. The existence and the qualitative properties of solutions to these Cauchy problems and the corresponding semigroups are investigated. More precisely, we show some comparison and maximum principles, submarkovian, domination, ultracontractivity properties, and some Hölder type estimates for these semigroups of operators.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a refined analytical framework adapted to local couplings and derive explicit convergence estimates in terms of the exploitability and optimality gap. The key difficulty lies in establishing uniform bounds on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman solutions; this is solved via the Cole--Hopf transformation under a standard quadratic Hamiltonian with a convection effect. We further provide numerical experiments demonstrating convergence behavior and confirming the theoretical rates. Additionally, the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions to the MFG system with locally coupled interactions are established."}

Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs."}

These schemes enable accurate resolution of complex stress and deformation fields in linear and nonlinear solids while retaining the flexibility of finite-volume methods. A key contribution is a JFNK solution strategy for these higher-order schemes, eliminating the need to assemble complex Jacobian matrices. A compact-stencil approximate Jacobian is used as a preconditioner, providing efficiency gains similar to second-order frameworks. To enhance robustness on irregular meshes, an alpha-stabilisation scheme is incorporated, damping high-frequency error modes without compromising formal accuracy. The proposed methodology is benchmarked across a suite of two- and three-dimensional test problems involving elastic and nonlinear materials, where key performance metrics, including accuracy, computational cost, memory usage, and robustness, are systematically evaluated. Results confirm that the higher-order formulations deliver substantial accuracy improvements over second-order schemes, while the JFNK approach achieves strong performance with only minimal modifications to existing segregated frameworks.

This work presents an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing optical simulations at the crystal array level, extending our single-crystal approach to a 3x3 BGO array. We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation. Training data is reduced eight-fold by exploiting symmetry. Evaluation employs three studies: a full array evaluation testing generalization from the fundamental domain to the complete geometry, a high-resolution study probing out-of-distribution generalization to untrained positions, and a pencil beam $γ$-photon study assessing practical applicability for experimental detector characterization. Performance is benchmarked against GATE10/Geant4 ground truth, using intrinsic fluctuations between independent Monte Carlo runs as baseline. OptiGAN achieves sliced Wasserstein similarity within 3$σ$-agreement of the baseline across all conditions, demonstrating successful generalization to the full array. The model transitions from electron-emission training data to realistic $γ$-photon interactions, producing flood maps that reproduce characteristic patterns including photopeak clusters and inter-crystal scatter lines. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that physics-informed generative models can accurately simulate optical photon transport in segmented scintillator arrays. The reproduction of experimentally relevant flood map features validates optiGAN for PET detector development and establishes a foundation for models generalizing across diverse array configurations."}

In this paper, we establish asymptotic 2-Wasserstein convergence results for SDE-based discretization methods employed in sampling for GDMs. We provide an all-at-once error bound analysis of the EM method that accounts for all error sources and establish convergence under all prevalent score-matching error assumptions in the literature, assuming a strongly log-concave data distribution.

This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates.

This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems.

This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders.

This procedure allows us to estimate the quality of the measured velocity fields, while also providing an alternative approach to pressure reconstruction, thereby avoiding invasive procedures. Since equal-order approximations have become a popular choice for problems linked to pressure recovery from MRI images, we design a stabilized finite element method allowing equal-order interpolations for velocity and pressure.

To this end, the uncertainty, which can be expressed via the so-called dose-influence matrix, is modelled using interval matrices. We use inverse robustness to introduce an additional objective, which aims to maximize the volume of the uncertainty set. A multi-criteria approach allows to handle the uncertainty while keeping appropriate values of the other objective functions.

Such models are typically of reaction-diffusion type, and model spatial propagation as a diffusive process. However, given the complex nature of human mobility, such models are limited in their ability to describe airborne infectious diseases in human populations. Recent work has advocated for the inclusion of an additional chemotaxis-type term as an alternative; spatial propagation of infection fronts is assumed additionally to flow from low-to-high concentrations of susceptible populations. The present work extends the study of such models by providing an epidemiologically interpretable analysis, directly connecting model behavior to information readily available to policymakers. In particular, we derive a spatially-aware basic reproduction number, which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density. Furthermore, we discuss several important aspects concerning the numerical solution of the model, including the introduction of a stabilization scheme.
