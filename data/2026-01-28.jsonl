Submitted to a journal", "summary": "This study presents a hybrid reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for turbulent incompressible flows on collocated finite volume grids. The methodology employs the \"discretize-then-project\" consistent flux strategy, which ensures mass conservation and pressure-velocity coupling without requiring auxiliary stabilization like boundary control or pressure stabilization techniques. However, because standard Galerkin projection fails to yield physically consistent results for the turbulent viscosity field, a hybrid strategy is adopted: velocity and pressure are resolved via intrusive projection, while the turbulent viscosity is reconstructed using a non-intrusive data-driven closure. We evaluate three neural network architectures, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the temporal evolution of the viscosity coefficients. Validated against a 3D Large Eddy Simulation of a lid-driven cavity, the LSTM-based closure demonstrates superior performance in capturing transient dynamics, achieving relative errors of 0.7\\% for velocity and 4\\% for turbulent viscosity. The resulting framework effectively combines the mathematical rigor of the consistent flux formulation with the adaptability of deep learning for turbulence modeling."}

In this work, we introduce a mathematical strategy to analyze the nonlinear stability of RK schemes that may not necessarily belong to the SSP class. With this approach, we mathematically demonstrate that there are time integration schemes outside the class of SSP schemes that can maintain entropy stability and positivity of density and pressure for the Lax-Friedrichs discretization, and Total Variation Diminishing stability for the first-order upwind and the second-order MUSCL schemes. As a result, for these problems, a broader range of RK methods, including the classical fourth-order, four-stage RK scheme, can be used while the numerical integration remains stable. Numerical experiments confirm these theoretical findings, and additional experiments demonstrate similar observations for a wider class of space discretizatins."}

We formulate operator assembly in the tensor train (TT) format, producing seven-dimensional operators for both fixed-source and $k$-eigenvalue neutron transport problems solved using the restarted Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES) and power iteration with an uncompressed solution vector. Our results on single-patch homogeneous and multi-patch heterogeneous problems, including a cruciform-shaped fuel array inspired by advanced reactor fuel designs, demonstrate the TT format's ability to compress interior operators from petabytes to megabytes, whereas the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix format requires gigabytes of storage. However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format.

We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. For electron-proton flows, the electron thermal energy only reaches up to a few percent of the initial ion kinetic energy."}

Classical analyses, beginning with Lamb's representation of the half-space response, typically assume an infinite plate and rely on diagonalization of the soil operator via the continuous Hankel transform. For a plate of finite radius $R$, however, both traction and displacement are supported only on $0 \\le r \\le R$, leading to the spatially truncated Lamb operator \\[ \\mathscr{M}(ω) = χ_{[0,R]} \\, T(ω)\\, χ_{[0,R]}, \\] where $T(ω)$ is the Hankel multiplier involving the Rayleigh denominator $Ω(ξ,ω)$. Truncation destroys the diagonal structure of $T(ω)$ and introduces real-axis singularities associated with the Rayleigh pole, in addition to square-root branch points at $ξ= k_T$ and $ξ= k_L$. We represent the action of $\\mathscr{M}(ω)$ on a finite-disk Bessel basis $\\{ φ_n(r) = A_{1,n} J_0(λ_n r) + A_{2,n} I_0(λ_n r)\\},$ which satisfies the free-edge boundary conditions of the plate, and derive explicit expressions for the resulting matrix elements. These involve integrals of the Lamb kernel evaluated as Cauchy principal values, with residue contributions corresponding to radiation damping in the half-space. The resulting operator matrix is dense but spectrally convergent. Its inversion yields a complete frequency-domain solution for finite-radius plates. The analysis reproduces Chen et al.'s finite-radius experiments for small $R$, approaches the infinite-radius limit as $R \\to \\infty$, and quantifies finite-radius corrections. To our knowledge, this is the first exact operator-level treatment of finite-radius plate-half-space interaction that retains the full nonlocal Lamb kernel."}

Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface.

In particular, bifurcations of the island topology modify the number and location of O-points, X-points, and separatrix boundaries, thereby altering diffusion pathways. In recent DIII-D experiments, external magnetic perturbations were used to rotate and periodically bifurcate the island on the q = 2 surface, causing a switchback between a q = 2/1-dominated structure and a narrower q = 4/2-dominated structure. To investigate how this topological change affects electron transport, we employ the field line tracing code TRIP3D with an implemented collisional operator. Thermal, tracer electrons launched from O-points, X-points, and outside separatrix boundaries reveal distinct diffusion regimes, including classical, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive behavior, depending on both the dominant island mode and launch location. These results suggest that island bifurcation can alter electron diffusion across rational surfaces, with direct implications for particle confinement. While the present work emphasizes diffusion as a general framework, the findings provide insight into the conditions under which electron trapping into an island or stochastization of the island's separatrix can enable additional mechanisms, such as the generation of energetic electrons."}

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical \"climate\" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales.

A compact torus (CT) is formed with a co-axial gun into a containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver, and an insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall (radial levitation) and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external coil configuration greatly improved both the levitated CT lifetime and the recurrence rate of shots with good compressional flux conservation. As confirmed by spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma impurity levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the insulating outer wall during the formation process. Significant increases in magnetic field, electron density, and ion temperature were routinely observed at magnetic compression in the final external coil configuration tested, despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an external kink mode, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation currents to that of the CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD activity associated with unintentional compression by the levitation field, and a higher probability of long-lived CTs. The DELiTE (Differential Equations on Linear Triangular Elements) framework was developed for spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on an unstructured triangular grid in axisymmetric geometry. The framework is based on discrete differential operators in matrix form, which are derived using linear finite elements and mimic some of the properties of their continuous counterparts. A single-fluid two-temperature MHD model is implemented in this framework."}

In addition, a low-order representation, characterizing the informative vortical structures and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients, can also be identified by considering autoencoder-based data compression. The present technique is applied to a range of aerodynamic examples, including extreme vortex-gust airfoil interactions, experimentally measured transverse jet-wing interaction, and a turbulent separated wake. For the cases of gust-wing interaction, the time-varying gust effect on the lift response is extracted in an interpretable manner.

The conventional definition of sub- and super-solutions based on variational inequalities often fails for natural function classes such as piecewise linear functions and encounters theoretical difficulties in non-convex polygonal domains, where H^2 regularity is lost because of corner singularities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons.

Training-free diffusion models provide an attractive alternative by exploiting analytically tractable score functions, and have recently enabled supervised learning of efficient end-to-end generative samplers. Despite their empirical success, the training-free diffusion models lack rigorous and numerically verifiable error estimates. In this work, we develop a comprehensive error analysis for a class of training-free diffusion models used to generate labeled data for supervised learning of generative samplers. By exploiting the availability of the exact score function for Gaussian mixture models, our analysis avoids propagating score-function approximation errors through the reverse-time diffusion process and recovers classical convergence rates for ODE discretization schemes, such as first-order convergence for the Euler method. Moreover, the resulting error bounds exhibit favorable dimension dependence, scaling as $O(d)$ in the $\\ell_2$ norm and $O(\\log d)$ in the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."}

Inspired by these important research achievements, a conceptually simple approach is proposed to facilitate reliable and efficient numerical simulations. The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method. Amongst others, it is demonstrated that the excellent mass and energy conservation in long-term evolutions, intrinsic attributes of geometric numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems, is maintained for a sensible variation of the time stepsizes.

We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch."}

However, highly coupled boundary operators present a significant challenge for TT. Despite the storage savings, TT formatted operators increase time-to-solution relative to CSR as an uncompressed solution vector forces operator-vector product scaling of $O(dr^2N^d\\log(N))$ for TT while CSR scales at $O(\\text{nnz})$. We mitigate this discrepancy by using mixed formats with interior operators in TT, while high-rank boundary operators remain in CSR format. We compare all results to Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic reference solutions. While CSR remains $<10\\times$ faster than this mixed format, the TDIGA method enables high-fidelity transport for expensive high-order IGA meshes."}

We combine these approaches by retaining the EnKF transport step and adding a principled importance-sampling correction. Our first contribution is a general importance-sampling theory for mixture targets and proposals, including variance comparisons between individual- and mixture-based estimators. We then interpret the stochastic EnKF analysis as sampling from explicit Gaussian-mixture proposals obtained by conditioning on the current or previous ensemble, which leads to six self-normalized IS-EnKF schemes. We embed these updates into a broader class of ensemble-based filters and prove consistency and error bounds, including weight-variance comparisons and sufficient conditions ensuring finite-variance importance weights. As a second contribution, we construct transported quasi-Monte Carlo (TQMC) point sets for the Gaussian-mixture laws arising in prediction and analysis, yielding TQMC-enhanced variants that can substantially reduce sampling error without changing the filtering pipeline. Numerical experiments on benchmark models compare the proposed mixture-weighted and TQMC-enhanced filters, showing improved filtering accuracy relative to BPF, EnKF, and the standard weighted EnKF, and that the weighted schemes eliminate the EnKF error plateau often caused by analysis-target mismatch."}

The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping.

Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-Vázquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-Hénon equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods.

Our main theorem is formulated using weighted sequence spaces that encode the $L^\\infty$-growth of the orthonormal system $(f_n)_{n}$, a feature that is crucial for obtaining sharp estimates. We apply our results to the stochastic heat equation with additive non-trace class noise. In this case, our conditions capture the scaling relationship between the heat operator and the coloring of the noise."}

This quantitative version of FUP yields an explicit essential spectral gap for convex co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from quasi-Fuchsian groups, thereby refining the result of Tao 2025. Our result extends the earlier work of Jin-Zhang 2020 to higher dimensions."}

The conventional definition of sub- and super-solutions based on variational inequalities often fails for natural function classes such as piecewise linear functions and encounters theoretical difficulties in non-convex polygonal domains, where H^2 regularity is lost because of corner singularities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method yields strict and accurate pointwise enclosures of the true solution, even for problems with discontinuous source terms or geometric singularities."}

We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation."}
