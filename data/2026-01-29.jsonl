The proposed method is based on a dual formulation approach: Two numerical solutions, corresponding to conservative and nonconservative formulations of the same system, are evolved simultaneously. Since nonconservative schemes are known to produce nonphysical weak solutions near discontinuities, we exploit the difference between these two solutions to construct a smoothness indicator (SI). In smooth regions, the difference between the conservative and nonconservative solutions is of the same order as the truncation error of the underlying discretization, whereas in nonsmooth regions, it is ${\\cal O}(1)$. We apply this idea to the Euler equations of gas dynamics and define the SI using differences in the momentum and pressure variables. This choice allows us to further distinguish neighborhoods of contact discontinuities from other nonsmooth parts of the computed solution. The resulting classification is used to adaptively select numerical discretizations. In the vicinities of contact discontinuities, we employ the low-dissipation central-upwind numerical flux and a second-order piecewise linear reconstruction with the slopes computed using an overcompressive SBM limiter. Elsewhere, we use an alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework with the central-upwind finite-volume numerical fluxes and either unlimited (in smooth regions) or Ai-WENO-Z (in the nonsmooth regions away from contact discontinuities) fifth-order interpolation. Numerical results for the one- and two-dimensional compressible Euler equations show that the proposed adaptive method improves both the computational efficiency and resolution of complex flow features compared with the non-adaptive fifth-order A-WENO scheme."}

The LSNN method is built on an equivalent least-squares formulation of the underlying problem on an admissible solution set that accommodates discontinuous solutions. It employs ReLU neural networks (in place of finite elements) as the approximating functions, uses a carefully designed physics-preserved numerical differentiation, and avoids penalization techniques such as artificial viscosity, entropy condition, and/or total variation. This approach captures shock features in the solution without oscillations or overshooting. Efficiently and reliably solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem posed by the LSNN method remains an open challenge.

Specifically, they determine which matrix nonzeros are classified as weak and so ignored when coarsening matrix graphs and defining interpolation sparsity patterns. The general goal is to encourage coarsening only in directions where error can be smoothed and to avoid coarsening across sharp problem variations. Unfortunately, developing robust and inexpensive strength-of-connection schemes is challenging.\n  The classification of matrix nonzeros involves four aspects: (a) choosing a strength-of-connection matrix, (b) scaling its values, (c) choosing a criterion to classify scaled values as strong or weak, and (d) dropping weak entries which includes adjusting matrix values to account for dropped terms. Typically, smoothed aggregation AMG uses the linear system being solved as a strength-of-connection matrix. It scales values symmetrically using square-roots of the matrix diagonal. It classifies based on whether scaled values are above or below a threshold. Finally, it adjusts matrix values by modifying the diagonal so that the sum of entries within each row of the dropped matrix matches that of the original. While these procedures can work well, we illustrate failure cases that motivate alternatives. The first alternative uses a distance Laplacian strength-of-connection matrix. The second centers on non-symmetric scaling. We then investigate alternative classification criteria based on identifying gaps in the values of the scaled entries. Finally, an alternative lumping procedure is proposed where row sums are preserved by modifying all retained matrix entries (as opposed to just diagonal entries). A series of numerical results illustrates trade-offs demonstrating in some cases notably more robust convergence on matrices coming from linear finite elements on stretched meshes."}

This failure stems from the artificial decoupling of energy modes, which ignores the exponential heating contributions from overpopulated high-lying states characteristic of Treanor-Gordiets distributions. We resolve this limitation by deriving a closed-form, thermodynamically consistent anharmonic gain function based on detailed balance and a second-order Dunham expansion. This formulation serves as a unified governing equation that naturally identifies the kinetic crossover between vibrational-vibrational (V-V) up-pumping and vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation. This approach accurately predicts the Treanor minimum and recovers the accuracy of full state-to-state benchmarks at a fraction of the computational cost. The model provides a robust closure for predicting electron temperature evolution in applications ranging from hypersonic flows to plasma-assisted combustion."}

To minimize the inaccuracy of direct Wasserstein solver, we propose a two-stage pipeline that retains one-step efficiency while reinstating an explicit $W_2$ objective where it is tractable. In Stage I, a Meanflow-style regressor yields a deterministic, one-step global transport that moves particles close to their terminal states.

It is found that the the final flow type tends either to vortical flow or zonal flow, whose statistics are completely different. Notably, these two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step is reduced to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each turbulent flow type should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise exerts a huge influence on the final flow type and statistics of numerically simulated NS turbulence (i.e., turbulence governed by the NS equations) because the time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations, as a turbulence model per se, require all small stochastic disturbances for $t>0$ to be negligible. This leads to a logical paradox in the underlying theory. Further investigations are recommended to reveal the essential differences between the exact solution of NS turbulence, numerical simulations of such NS turbulence, and the corresponding actual turbulence. It should be emphasized that NS turbulence is closely related to the fourth Millennium problem, and turbulence is an unsolved fundamental problem in classic mechanics. Hopefully this paradox would be helpful to deepen our understandings about the turbulence and the fourth Millennium problem."}

The native-space norms of these interpolants are evaluated over a bounded range of~$m$, producing a \\emph{Sobolev-scale norm profile}. The elbow of this profile serves as a quantitative probe of the underlying local regularity~$s(Ω_z)$.

Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.\n  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.\n  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.\n  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows."}

In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{Δh}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{Δh}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup.

The theory rigorously establishes that these bases emerge as explicit linear combinations of B-spline element bases. For any prescribed smoothness requirements, this element-wise formulation enables the Hermite interpolation at nodes, which directly utilizes function values and derivatives without solving global linear systems. By focusing on explicit interpolation properties, element-wise analysis establishes optimal approximation errors, even when the space smoothness attains its theoretical maximum for the space degree. In isogeometric analysis (IgA), the construction naturally decomposes geometric mappings into element-level representations, allowing efficient computations across elements regardless of node distribution. Notably, the same Hermite interpolation framework simultaneously handles domain parameterization and IgA solutions, allowing direct imposition of boundary conditions through function and derivative matching. Numerical tests demonstrate optimal convergence rates and superconvergence properties in 2D IgA under uniform knot configurations, and improved computational efficiency in 3D IgA with non-uniform knot distributions."}

Taking into account human intervention and temporal variation in rainfall, this paper develops a two-season switching faecal-oral model with impulsive intervention and free boundaries. In this model, the infection fronts are represented by fixed boundaries during the dry season and by moving boundaries during the wet season, with impulsive intervention occurring at the end of each wet season. The simultaneous introduction of impulsive intervention and seasonal switching creates new difficulties for mathematical analysis. We overcome these challenges through novel analytical techniques, resulting in a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and a sharp criteria governing this dichotomy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical results and to visually illustrate the influence of seasonal switching and impulsive intervention. Our results mathematically explain that two factors, the duration of the dry season and the intensity of impulsive intervention are both positively correlated with effective disease control."}

Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation.

We propose an algorithm that uses the Golub-Klema-Stewart framework (GKS) to select sensors and provide an analysis of lower bounds on the D-optimality of these sensor placements. To reduce the computational cost in the GKS step, we propose and analyze algorithms for the D-optimal sensor placements using Nyström approximations on the covariance matrix. Moreover, we propose several algorithms that select sensors via Nyström approximation of the covariance matrix, utilizing the randomized Nyström approximation, random pivoted Cholesky and greedy pivoted Cholesky. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two applications: thin liquid film dynamics and sea surface temperature."}

The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries."}

The result in (i) shows that the zero eigenvalue arising from translation invariance is embedded in the essential spectrum. Consequently, the standard Evans function approach cannot be applied directly to prove (iii). To resolve this, we employ an Evans-function framework that extends into regions of the essential spectrum, thereby enabling us to compute the derivative of the Evans function at the origin. Our result establishes that this derivative admits a factorization into two factors: one associated with transversality of the connecting profile and the other with hyperbolic stability of the corresponding shock of the quasi-neutral Euler system.

Our model contains an Allee effect that induces a saddle point and admits an explicit solution along with the extinction threshold of a time-dependent Allee parameter. More specifically, we derive an integral inequality that serves as a necessary condition for the occurrence of rate-induced tipping. A remarkable point in the proposed model is that it can handle population extinction such that the solution completely vanishes in a finite amount of time. An unconditionally stable cubature method suitable for our model is proposed, and its superiority over the classical forward Euler method is discussed. We also discuss a fisheries application where inland fisheries rose and fell from modern times to the present in Japan.

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines."}

This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure.

This progress naturally motivated the study of the harmonic map heat flow into singular metric spaces.\n  In the 1990s, Mayer and Jost independently studied convex functionals on $CAT(0)$ spaces and extended Crandall-Liggett's theory of gradient flows from Banach spaces to $CAT(0)$ spaces to obtain the weak solutions, called semi-group weak solutions, for the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. Very recently, Lin, Segatti, Sire, and Wang used an elliptic approximation method to obtain another class of weak solutions, called suitable weak solutions in the sense of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI), to the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. They proved that these solutions are Lipschitz in space and $\\frac{1}{2}$-Hölder continuous in time.\n  Since the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow enjoy the favorable long-time existence, uniqueness and well established long-time behaviors, it is natural to ask if the semi-group solutions possess the Lipschitz regularity. In the present paper, we answer this question. We show that the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow into CAT(0) spaces are Lipschitz continuous in both space and time.
