The proposed method is based on a dual formulation approach: Two numerical solutions, corresponding to conservative and nonconservative formulations of the same system, are evolved simultaneously. Since nonconservative schemes are known to produce nonphysical weak solutions near discontinuities, we exploit the difference between these two solutions to construct a smoothness indicator (SI). In smooth regions, the difference between the conservative and nonconservative solutions is of the same order as the truncation error of the underlying discretization, whereas in nonsmooth regions, it is ${\\cal O}(1)$. We apply this idea to the Euler equations of gas dynamics and define the SI using differences in the momentum and pressure variables. This choice allows us to further distinguish neighborhoods of contact discontinuities from other nonsmooth parts of the computed solution. The resulting classification is used to adaptively select numerical discretizations. In the vicinities of contact discontinuities, we employ the low-dissipation central-upwind numerical flux and a second-order piecewise linear reconstruction with the slopes computed using an overcompressive SBM limiter. Elsewhere, we use an alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework with the central-upwind finite-volume numerical fluxes and either unlimited (in smooth regions) or Ai-WENO-Z (in the nonsmooth regions away from contact discontinuities) fifth-order interpolation.

Specifically, they determine which matrix nonzeros are classified as weak and so ignored when coarsening matrix graphs and defining interpolation sparsity patterns. The general goal is to encourage coarsening only in directions where error can be smoothed and to avoid coarsening across sharp problem variations. Unfortunately, developing robust and inexpensive strength-of-connection schemes is challenging.\n  The classification of matrix nonzeros involves four aspects: (a) choosing a strength-of-connection matrix, (b) scaling its values, (c) choosing a criterion to classify scaled values as strong or weak, and (d) dropping weak entries which includes adjusting matrix values to account for dropped terms. Typically, smoothed aggregation AMG uses the linear system being solved as a strength-of-connection matrix. It scales values symmetrically using square-roots of the matrix diagonal. It classifies based on whether scaled values are above or below a threshold. Finally, it adjusts matrix values by modifying the diagonal so that the sum of entries within each row of the dropped matrix matches that of the original. While these procedures can work well, we illustrate failure cases that motivate alternatives. The first alternative uses a distance Laplacian strength-of-connection matrix. The second centers on non-symmetric scaling. We then investigate alternative classification criteria based on identifying gaps in the values of the scaled entries. Finally, an alternative lumping procedure is proposed where row sums are preserved by modifying all retained matrix entries (as opposed to just diagonal entries).

The forward map, from the wave speed to the measurements, is derived from Maxwell's equations. It is a nonlinear map that accounts for multiple scattering and it is very oscillatory at high frequencies. This makes the standard, nonlinear least squares data fitting formulation of the inverse problem difficult to solve. We introduce an alternative, two-step approach: The first step computes the nonlinear map from the measurements to an approximation of the electric field inside the unknown medium aka, the internal wave. This is done for each antenna location in a non-iterative manner.\n  The internal wave fits the data by construction, but it does not solve Maxwell's equations. The second step uses optimization to minimize the discrepancy between the internal wave and the solution of Maxwell's equations, for all antenna locations. The optimization is iterative. The first step defines an imaging function whose computational cost is comparable to that of standard SAR imaging, but it gives a better estimate of the support of targets. Further iterations improve the quantitative estimation of the wave speed.
