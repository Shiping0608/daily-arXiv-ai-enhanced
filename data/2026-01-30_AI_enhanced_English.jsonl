The approach shows coarse-grained generators are approximated by constant-coefficient Laplacians with effective diffusivity growing like r^\u03b3.", "result": "Proves quenched power-law superdiffusion: for typical realizations, displacement variance grows like t^{2/(2-\u03b3)} in perturbative regime \u03b3\u226a1. Identifies leading prefactor up to random relative error of order \u03b3^{\u00bd}|log \u03b3|\u00b3. Also proves anomalous regularization: solutions are H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent 1-C\u03b3^{\u00bd}.", "conclusion": "The paper provides rigorous mathematical foundation for superdiffusive scaling in multiscale random flows, confirming renormalization group predictions and establishing precise error bounds. The scale-local approximation reflects the multifractal nature of the environment."}}
