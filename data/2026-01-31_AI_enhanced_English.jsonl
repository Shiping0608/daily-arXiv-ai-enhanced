Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \\geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term.

This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \\neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\\infty}$ estimates for the remainder.

Traditionally, this space is a subspace of a fixed ambient reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), determined solely by the chosen kernel and the dataset, whose elements identify the basis elements. Consequently, the projection operator underlying the kernel method depends on the loss function, the dataset, and the choice of ambient RKHS. In this study, we consider kernel methods whose solution spaces also depend on learnable parameters that are independent of the dataset. The resulting methods can be viewed as variable projection operators that depend on the loss function, the dataset, and the new learnable parameters instead of a fixed RKHS. This work has two main contributions. First, we propose an efficient approximation of kernels associated with infinite-dimensional RKHSs, commonly used to reduce the solution-space dimension for large datasets. Second, we construct fixed-dimensional, parameter-dependent solution spaces that enable highly efficient kernel models suitable for large-scale problems without the need to approximate kernels of infinite-dimensional RKHSs.
