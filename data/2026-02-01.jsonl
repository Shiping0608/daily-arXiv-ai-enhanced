To further enhance the approximation accuracy, a median filter is applied to the spatial data, and the predicted solution is constrained through a bounded linear mapping. Moreover, for certain nonlinear problems, we introduce a modified loss function inspired by the upwind numerical scheme to alleviate the excessive smoothing of discontinuous solutions typically observed in neural network approximations."}

At the same time, we embed entropy-stable design principles by jointly learning a convex entropy function and its associated flux potential, ensuring entropy dissipation and the selection of physically admissible weak solutions. A corresponding entropy-stable numerical flux scheme provides compatibility with standard discretizations, allowing seamless integration into classical solvers. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems, including Burgers, shallow water, Euler, and KPP equations, demonstrate that SymCLaw generalizes to unseen initial conditions, maintains stability under noisy training data, and achieves accurate long-time predictions, highlighting its potential as a principled foundation for data-driven modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws."}

On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios."}

In particular, for the smoothest spline (B-spline) solution, the abundance of superconvergence points allows us to construct asymptotic expansion of the error within the element that fully characterize all superconvergence points, for both function values and derivatives. The theoretical framework is then extended to higher-dimensional settings on simplicial and tensor-product meshes, and the essential conclusions are preserved, with one-dimensional derivatives generalized to mixed derivatives.

Physics-consistent approaches typically treat physical laws as soft constraints within the loss function, a strategy that frequently fails to guarantee strict adherence to the governing equations, or rely on post-processing corrections that do not intrinsically learn the underlying solution geometry. To address these limitations, we introduce the {Conditional Denoising Model (CDM)}, a generative model designed to learn the geometry of the physical manifold itself. By training the network to restore clean states from noisy ones, the model learns a vector field that points continuously towards the valid solution subspace. We introduce a time-independent formulation that transforms inference into a deterministic fixed-point iteration, effectively projecting noisy approximations onto the equilibrium manifold. Validated on a low-temperature plasma physics and chemistry benchmark, the CDM achieves higher parameter and data efficiency than physics-consistent baselines. Crucially, we demonstrate that the denoising objective acts as a powerful implicit regularizer: despite never seeing the governing equations during training, the model adheres to physical constraints more strictly than baselines trained with explicit physics losses."}

Specifically, we consider the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) method for DLRA proposed and analyzed in arXiv:2308.11581v4, which consists of a linear combination of products between deterministic orthonormal modes and stochastic modes, both time-dependent. The first strategy we consider for numerical time-integration is very standard, consisting in a forward discretization in time of both deterministic and stochastic components. Its convergence is proven subject to a time-step restriction dependent on the smallest singular value of the Gram matrix associated to the stochastic modes. Under the same condition on the time-step, this smallest singular value is shown to be always positive, provided that the SDE under study is driven by a non-degenerate noise. The second and the third algorithms, on the other hand, are staggered ones, in which we alternately update the deterministic and the stochastic modes in half steps. These approaches are shown to be more stable than the first one and allow us to obtain convergence results without the aforementioned restriction on the time-step. Computational experiments support theoretical results. In this work we do not consider the discretization in probability, which will be the topic of Part II."}

We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfvén wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion.

Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \\geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \\cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $γ$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B > 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \\neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{α,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations.

With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate.

This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks.

Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields."}

Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist.

Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations."}

However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe).

Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields."}

NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties.

We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\\pm 1^\\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time."}

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities."}

More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task."}

This paper proposes Physics-Informed Learning via Diffusion (PILD), a framework that unifies diffusion modeling and first-principles physical constraints by introducing a virtual residual observation sampled from a Laplace distribution to supervise generation during training. To further integrate physical laws, a conditional embedding module is incorporated to inject physical information into the denoising network at multiple layers, ensuring consistent guidance throughout the diffusion process. The proposed PILD framework is concise, modular, and broadly applicable to problems governed by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, as well as algebraic equations or inequality constraints. Extensive experiments across engineering and scientific tasks including estimating vehicle trajectories, tire forces, Darcy flow and plasma dynamics, demonstrate that our PILD substantially improves accuracy, stability, and generalization over existing physics-informed and diffusion-based baselines."}

This has motivated the development of iterative algorithms that avoid explicit eigendecompositions and rely primarily on matrix multiplications, making them well suited for modern GPU accelerators. We present PRISM (Polynomial-fitting and Randomized Iterative Sketching for Matrix functions computation), a general framework for accelerating iterative algorithms for computing matrix functions. PRISM combines adaptive polynomial approximation with randomized sketching: at each iteration, it fits a polynomial surrogate to the current spectrum via a sketched least-squares problem, adapting to the instance at hand with minimal overhead. We apply PRISM to accelerate Newton-Schulz-like iterations for matrix square roots and orthogonalization, which are core primitives in machine learning. Unlike prior methods, PRISM requires no explicit spectral bounds or singular value estimates; and it adapts automatically to the evolving spectrum. Empirically, PRISM accelerates training when integrated into Shampoo and Muon optimizers."}

In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\\mathcal{S}_{ψ,ω}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\\mathcal{S}'_{ψ,ω}$, ensuring that the underlying Fréchet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $δ_{ψ,ω}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{ψ,ω}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \\le C ω(t)^{-1} \\|u\\|_{H^s_{ψ,ω}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $ω$. This framework provides a unified geometric characterization of several fractional regimes, including the Hadamard and Riemann-Liouville cases, within a single operator-theoretic architecture."}

Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity."}

In the perturbative regime $γ\\ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-γ)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $γ^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log γ\\right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\\nabla \\cdot (νI_d + \\mathbf{k} ) \\nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^γ$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $γ^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log γ\\right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are Hölder continuous with exponent $1 - Cγ^{\\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $ν$ and the scale."}
