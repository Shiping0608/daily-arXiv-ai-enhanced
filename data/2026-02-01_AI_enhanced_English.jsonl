Our analysis is motivated by the challenge of solving fully nonlinear Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations in high dimensions by means of a Neural Network, which is trained by minimizing residuals arising from monotone discretizations of the Hamiltonian. While classical theory ensures that consistency and monotonicity imply convergence to the viscosity solution, treating these discrete systems as optimization problems introduces new analytical hurdles: solvability and the uniqueness of local minima do not follow from monotonicity alone.\n  By establishing the well--posedness of these optimization--based solvers, our framework enables the adaptation of Level Set Methods to high--dimensional settings, unlocking new capabilities in applications such as high--dimensional segmentation and interface tracking. Finally, we observe that these arguments extend almost directly to degenerate elliptic or parabolic PDEs on graphs equipped with monotone graph Laplacians.", "AI": {"tldr": "Residual minimization for monotone discretizations of nonlinear PDEs yields well-posed discrete solutions, enabling neural network-based solutions for high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations.", "motivation": "To solve fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations in high dimensions using neural networks trained by minimizing residuals from monotone discretizations, addressing analytical challenges of solvability and uniqueness of local minima.", "method": "Derive sufficient conditions for well-posedness of residual minimization with monotone finite-difference discretizations, establishing framework for optimization-based solvers.", "result": "Established well-posedness of optimization-based solvers, enabling adaptation of Level Set Methods to high-dimensional settings for applications like segmentation and interface tracking.", "conclusion": "The analysis extends to degenerate elliptic/parabolic PDEs on graphs with monotone graph Laplacians, providing theoretical foundation for neural network-based PDE solutions in high dimensions."}}

The approach shows that coarse-grained generators are approximated by constant-coefficient Laplacians with effective diffusivity growing like r^\u03b3.", "result": "Proves quenched power-law superdiffusion: for typical realizations, displacement variance grows as t^{2/(2-\u03b3)}. Identifies leading prefactor up to random relative error of order \u03b3^{1/2}|log \u03b3|^3. Also proves anomalous regularization: solutions are H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent 1 - C\u03b3^{1/2}.", "conclusion": "The paper provides rigorous mathematical justification for renormalization group predictions of superdiffusion in multiscale random flows, demonstrating scale-local approximations and anomalous regularization properties in the perturbative regime \u03b3\u226a1."}}
