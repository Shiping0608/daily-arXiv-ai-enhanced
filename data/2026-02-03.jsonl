Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces."}

The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $<10\\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $<0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \\pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\\sim 3$ meters over the past $\\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state."}

Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time.

Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT.

In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity."}

We introduce a simple design principle for constructing dissipation-preserving finite difference schemes and apply it to the Swift--Hohenberg equation in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis relies on discrete inequalities for the underlying energy, assuming a Lipschitz continuous gradient and either convexity or $μ$-strong convexity of the relevant terms.

By amortizing sampling effort over the entire domain during training, FNWoS achieves more accurate evaluation at arbitrary query points with dramatically fewer trajectories than classical FWoS. To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $α$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count.

Numerical results show that the framework enables accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, with increasing robustness and fidelity as richer QoIs are considered. The methodology also provides a foundation for generative mechanical design by enabling the synthesis of new geometries and responses through latent-space exploration."}

This work introduces Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO), extending the recursive least-squares (RLS) framework to this regime through a numerically stable formulation based on orthogonal-triangular updates. A QR-based exponentially weighted RLS (QR-EWRLS) algorithm is introduced, combining random Fourier feature mappings with forgetting-factor regularization to enable online adaptation under non-stationary conditions. The orthogonal decomposition prevents the numerical divergence associated with covariance-form RLS while retaining adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experiments on nonlinear synthetic time series confirm that the proposed approach maintains bounded residuals and stable condition numbers while reproducing the double-descent behavior characteristic of overparameterized models. Applications to forecasting foreign exchange and electricity demand show that ABO is highly accurate (comparable to baseline kernel methods) while achieving speed improvements of between 20 and 40 percent. The results provide a unified view linking adaptive filtering, kernel approximation, and benign overfitting within a stable online learning framework."}

We close a longstanding gap by deriving exact moment matching for the probit, GeLU, ReLU (as a limit of GeLU), Heaviside (as a limit of probit), and sine activation functions; for both feedforward and generalized residual layers. On random networks, we find orders-of-magnitude improvements in the KL divergence error metric, up to a millionfold, over popular alternatives. On real data, we find competitive statistical calibration for inference under epistemic uncertainty in the input. On a variational Bayes network, we show that our method attains hundredfold improvements in KL divergence from Monte Carlo ground truth over a state-of-the-art deterministic inference method. We also give an a priori error bound and a preliminary analysis of stochastic feedforward neurons, which have recently attracted general interest."}

In the MOR framework, registration methods exploit solution snapshots to identify a parametric coordinate transformation that improves the approximation of the solution set through linear subspaces. For each training parameter, optimization-based (or variational) registration methods minimize a target function that measures the alignment of the coherent structures of interest (e.g., shocks, shear layers, cracks) for different parameter values, over a family of bijections of the computational domain $Ω$. We consider diffeomorphisms $Φ$ that are vector flows of given velocity fields $v$ with vanishing normal component on $\\partial Ω$; we rely on a sensor to extract appropriate point clouds from the solution snapshots and we develop an expectation-maximization procedure to simultaneously solve the point cloud matching problem and to determine the velocity $v$ (and thus the bijection $Φ$); finally, we combine our registration method with the nonlinear interpolation technique of [Iollo, Taddei, J. Comput. Phys., 2022] to perform accurate interpolations of fluid dynamic fields in the presence of shocks. Numerical results for a two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow past a NACA airfoil and a three-dimensional viscous transonic flow past an ONERA M6 wing illustrate the many elements of the methodology and demonstrate the effectiveness of nonlinear interpolation for shock-dominated fields."}

We introduce physics-informed M\"untz-Sz'asz Networks (MSN-PINN), a power-law basis network that treats scaling exponents as trainable parameters. The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|μ- α|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error. Constraint-aware training encodes physical requirements such as boundary condition compatibility and improves accuracy by three orders of magnitude over naive training. By combining the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of asymptotic analysis, MSN-PINN produces learned parameters with direct physical meaning."}

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models."}
