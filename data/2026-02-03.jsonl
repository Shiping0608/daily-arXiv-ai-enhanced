Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces."}

The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $<10\\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $<0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \\pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\\sim 3$ meters over the past $\\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state."}

Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time.

Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT.

In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity."}

We introduce a simple design principle for constructing dissipation-preserving finite difference schemes and apply it to the Swift--Hohenberg equation in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis relies on discrete inequalities for the underlying energy, assuming a Lipschitz continuous gradient and either convexity or $μ$-strong convexity of the relevant terms.

By amortizing sampling effort over the entire domain during training, FNWoS achieves more accurate evaluation at arbitrary query points with dramatically fewer trajectories than classical FWoS. To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $α$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count.

Numerical results show that the framework enables accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, with increasing robustness and fidelity as richer QoIs are considered. The methodology also provides a foundation for generative mechanical design by enabling the synthesis of new geometries and responses through latent-space exploration."}

This work introduces Adaptive Benign Overfitting (ABO), extending the recursive least-squares (RLS) framework to this regime through a numerically stable formulation based on orthogonal-triangular updates. A QR-based exponentially weighted RLS (QR-EWRLS) algorithm is introduced, combining random Fourier feature mappings with forgetting-factor regularization to enable online adaptation under non-stationary conditions. The orthogonal decomposition prevents the numerical divergence associated with covariance-form RLS while retaining adaptability to evolving data distributions. Experiments on nonlinear synthetic time series confirm that the proposed approach maintains bounded residuals and stable condition numbers while reproducing the double-descent behavior characteristic of overparameterized models. Applications to forecasting foreign exchange and electricity demand show that ABO is highly accurate (comparable to baseline kernel methods) while achieving speed improvements of between 20 and 40 percent. The results provide a unified view linking adaptive filtering, kernel approximation, and benign overfitting within a stable online learning framework."}

To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic five-equation quasi-conservative model, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Grüneisen coefficient $Γ$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $Γ$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error of the RFQC method is a high-order term relative to the spatial reconstruction truncation error. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions."}

Implementation of Coulomb collisions is tested on the problem of temperature relaxation in a two-component plasma and demonstrates good agreement with the analytical theory. Since quasi-neutrality of plasma is not strictly determined, the model is able to correctly reproduce the ambipolar electric potential profile up to the walls. At the same time, the main advantage of implicit PIC simulations - the ability to use large grid steps, many times larger than the Debye radius - does not prevent the correct modeling of the near-wall electric potential jump. The model satisfactorily reproduces the known results of the Debye sheath theory and the Bohm criterion. A comparison of stationary plasma profiles formed in a mirror trap in the presence of a constant particle source with the results of simulations using the hybrid code MIDAS showed that self-consistent consideration of electron kinetics in expanders leads to noticeable (at the level of 15 %) differences in the electron temperature, potential, and density of the confined plasma."}

Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables."}

Because of the similarity in the governing equations, the system dynamics is worked out exactly in parallel to the methods developed for investigating catastrophic relaxation in stellar plasmas [1-3]. In the latter a more ``complex\" equilibrium state, on slow changes in the environment, can lose its equilibrium (catastrophe), and transform to a less complex state with a very different energy mix from the original. It is shown that a similar transformation in the weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas will convert much of its gravitation energy into kinetic energy in the flow. Since flows are a perennial ingredient of high-energy astrophysical systems, the energy transformation processes revealed in present study, can advance our understanding of a variety of them.

As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity.

Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control.

Unlike traditional Taylor expansions based on local polynomial approximations, the proposed approach arises from exact differential identities that link a function and its derivatives through polynomial weight factors. This formulation expresses smooth functions via divergence-based relations connecting derivatives of all orders with systematically scaled polynomial coefficients. This framework provides a natural foundation for constructing high-order numerical quadrature formulas, particularly for multi-dimensional domains. By exploiting the divergence structure, volume integrals are systematically transformed into boundary integrals using the Divergence Theorem, recursively reducing the integration domain from an $n$-dimensional body to its $(n-1)$-dimensional facets, and ultimately to its vertices.\n  The article further enhances the framework's accuracy by introducing a complex-shift technique. It is demonstrated that by positioning the expansion center at specific roots of unity in the complex plane, lower-order error terms are annihilated, yielding high-order real-valued quadrature rules with minimal function evaluations. Additionally, a rigorous geometric analysis of the affine transformations required for surface integration is provided, deriving explicit formulas for the transformation of normal vectors and surface measures.

Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition.

We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures.

We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation."}

Namely, we study the interaction of a viscous incompressible flow with bulk poroelasticity, via a poroelastic interface. The configuration consists of two 3D toroidal subdomains connected via a plate interface, which permits elastic deformation and perfusive fluid dynamics. The governing dynamics comprise Stokes equations in the bulk fluid region, Biot's equations in the bulk poroelastic region, and the recent poroplate of Mikelić at the interface. Coupling occurs on the top and lower surfaces of the plate, and involves conservation of mass, stress balance, and a certain slip condition for the fluid free-flow.\n  We seek strong (and mild) solutions in the Hilbert space framework via the Lumer-Phillips theorem. The resolvent analysis employs a nonstandard mixed variational formulation which captures the complex, multi-physics coupling at the interface. We explicitly characterize the infinitesimal generator associated to the linear Cauchy problem and establish the generation of a $C_0$-semigroup on a suitably chosen finite-energy space. With the semigroup in hand, we may treat elastic nonlinearities for plate displacements through perturbation theory. These result parallel those for Biot-Stokes filtration systems, and complement the recently established weak solution theory for multilayer filtrations. The agency of the semigroup straightforwardly admits structural (plate) nonlinearity into the dynamics. Future stability and regularity analyses for multilayer filtrations are also made possible by these results, as well as a comparison of spectral and regularity properties between filtration configurations, and the elucidation of the mitigating poroplate dynamics as possibly regularizing and stabilizing."}

While existing research on scalable pseudospectral computation has focused on exploiting sparsity structures, common in discretizations of differential operators, these approaches are ill-suited for machine learning and data-driven dynamical systems, where operators are typically dense but approximately low-rank. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive low-rank framework that dramatically reduces this computational burden. Our core theoretical contribution is an exact characterization of the pseudospectrum of arbitrary low-rank matrices, reducing the evaluation of resolvent norms to eigenvalue problems of dimension proportional to the rank. Building on this foundation, we derive rigorous inclusion sets for the pseudospectra of general matrices via truncated and randomized low-rank approximations, with explicit perturbation bounds. These results enable efficient estimators for key stability quantities, including distance to instability and Kreiss constants, at a cost that scales with the effective rank rather than the ambient dimension. We further demonstrate how our framework naturally extends to data-driven settings, providing pseudospectral analysis of transfer operators learned from nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. Numerical experiments confirm orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving accuracy, opening pseudospectral analysis to previously intractable high-dimensional problems in computational PDEs, control theory, and data-driven dynamics."}

The proof uses a spatial-dynamics Hamiltonian formulation of the travelling-wave equations and a nonlinear change of variables that flattens the free surface while putting the symplectic form into Darboux coordinates. Near a distinguished curve in the vorticity--capillarity parameter space, the linearization has a two-dimensional center subspace; a parameter-dependent center-manifold reduction yields a canonical planar Hamiltonian system.

However, most existing PINN approaches are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which may require large network sizes and extensive training to achieve high accuracy, especially for complex interface problems. In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs."}

In this paper, utilizing Morse-Bott functions, we present a rigorous analysis of HiSD for computing degenerate saddle points on a critical manifold.

As Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems gain widespread adoption and show promise for improving both efficiency and safety, understanding how these waves evolve under ACC becomes increasingly important. Yet most existing analyses rely on steady-state metrics (e.g., equilibrium spacing) and neglect the ACC control-law parameters, such as feedback gains, that fundamentally shape higher-order traffic dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we embed the ACC control law directly into the momentum equation while retaining mass conservation law. The result is a higher-order macroscopic model whose dynamics are governed by a second-order partial differential equation equivalent to the linear ACC feedback law. Analyzing the flux Jacobian confirms that the system is strictly hyperbolic, thereby preserving anisotropy and ensuring physical consistency. The derivation also shows that traffic wave evolution depends on both the initial state and the ACC control parameters. We analyze wave-propagation characteristics, linear degeneracy, admissible discontinuities, and their connection to ACC string stability, with the corresponding derivations. Numerical experiments confirm that the second-order model yields markedly lower vehicle-pair speed deviations along wave paths than a first-order model subject to the same non-steady disturbances, underscoring both the necessity of a second-order treatment and the soundness of the proposed framework."}

The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $β\\to\\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals.

As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization.

By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{αn})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs.

We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks.

Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction.

As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings."}

However, existing GNN-based methods often face challenges in learning multiscale representations and modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. In this work, we propose an efficient multiscale graph-based learning framework tailored to proteins. Our proposed framework contains two crucial components: (1) It constructs a hierarchical graph representation comprising a collection of fine-grained subgraphs, each corresponding to a secondary structure motif (e.g., $α$-helices, $β$-strands, loops), and a single coarse-grained graph that connects these motifs based on their spatial arrangement and relative orientation. (2) It employs two GNNs for feature learning: the first operates within individual secondary motifs to capture local interactions, and the second models higher-level structural relationships across motifs. Our modular framework allows a flexible choice of GNN in each stage. Theoretically, we show that our hierarchical framework preserves the desired maximal expressiveness, ensuring no loss of critical structural information. Empirically, we demonstrate that integrating baseline GNNs into our multiscale framework remarkably improves prediction accuracy and reduces computational cost across various benchmarks."}

At a solution, the Gâteaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces.

However, solving high-fidelity PDEs remains computationally prohibitive, particularly for parametric systems requiring multiple evaluations across varying parameter configurations. This paper presents MF-BPINN, a novel multi-fidelity framework that synergistically combines physics-informed neural networks with Bayesian uncertainty quantification and adaptive residual learning. Our approach leverages abundant low-fidelity simulations alongside sparse high-fidelity data through a hierarchical neural architecture that learns nonlinear correlations across fidelity levels. We introduce an adaptive residual network with learnable gating mechanisms that dynamically balances linear and nonlinear fidelity discrepancies. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous Bayesian framework employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo."}

We construct suitable feedback control inputs using the control Lyapunov functional and establish stabilization in the \\(L^{2}, H^{1},\\) and \\(H^{2}\\)-norms. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established through the Faedo-Galerkin method. Moreover, we show the global stabilization where the diffusion coefficient $ν$ is unknown. Then, we apply a \\(C^{0}\\)-conforming finite element method to the spatial variable while keeping the time variable continuous. Furthermore, we obtain global stabilization of the semi-discrete scheme and optimal error estimates for the state variable in the \\(L^{\\infty}\\), \\(L^{2}\\), and \\(H^{1}\\)-norms, using the Ritz-Volterra projection. Additionally, error estimates for the feedback control laws are established. Lastly, we present some numerical simulations to demonstrate the theoretical findings."}

Nguyen"], "title": "Regularization for Multi-Phase 2D Euler Equations via Competing Transport Markers", "categories": ["math.AP", "math-ph", "math.NA"], "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce a novel regularization framework for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equation that exactly preserves the transport structure of multi-phase vorticity fields. The key step is a reformulation of multi-phase vortex patch data in terms of a finite family of passively advected scalar marker functions: at each point, the local vorticity is determined by a smooth, pointwise selection rule arising from competition among these markers. The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $β\\to\\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$β$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics."}

Despite the success of machine learning methods in learning SDE dynamics, existing approaches either require expensive neural network training for score function estimation or lack the ability to handle continuous parameter dependence. We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values."}
