Unlike traditional Taylor expansions based on local polynomial approximations, the proposed approach arises from exact differential identities that link a function and its derivatives through polynomial weight factors. This formulation expresses smooth functions via divergence-based relations connecting derivatives of all orders with systematically scaled polynomial coefficients. This framework provides a natural foundation for constructing high-order numerical quadrature formulas, particularly for multi-dimensional domains. By exploiting the divergence structure, volume integrals are systematically transformed into boundary integrals using the Divergence Theorem, recursively reducing the integration domain from an $n$-dimensional body to its $(n-1)$-dimensional facets, and ultimately to its vertices.\n  The article further enhances the framework's accuracy by introducing a complex-shift technique. It is demonstrated that by positioning the expansion center at specific roots of unity in the complex plane, lower-order error terms are annihilated, yielding high-order real-valued quadrature rules with minimal function evaluations. Additionally, a rigorous geometric analysis of the affine transformations required for surface integration is provided, deriving explicit formulas for the transformation of normal vectors and surface measures.

From a theoretical perspective, we introduce a gradient-weighted modification of the coupled complex-boundary method (CCBM) incorporating an \\(H^1\\)-type term, and formulate the reconstruction as a regularized optimization problem over bounded admissible coefficients. We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures. In the reported tests, for sufficiently large but not excessive $H^1$-weights, the modified CCBM is observed to yield more stable reconstructions and to reduce certain high-frequency artifacts. Across the numerical scenarios considered in this study, the method often demonstrates favorable stability and robustness properties relative to several classical boundary-based formulations, although performance remains problem- and parameter-dependent. A projection-based extension further supports stable recovery of piecewise-constant diffusion coefficients in multi-subregion test cases.

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.
