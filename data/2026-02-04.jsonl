This work presents a novel approach for resolving flow problems using the LATIN-PGD solver. In this contribution, we place ourselves within the framework of Newtonian compressible and laminar flows. This specific and relatively simple case enables focusing on flows for which a state equation provides a direct relation between pressure and density. It is then possible to use the LATIN solver to set up a pressure-velocity decoupling algorithm. Moreover, Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is natively included in the solver and yields two independent space-time decompositions for the velocity and the pressure fields. As a first step, the solver is validated on a problem for which an analytical solution is available. It is then applied to slightly more complex problems. The results show good agreement with the literature, and we expect that the solver could be used to compute more complicated material laws in the future."}

The target problem is the reproduction of mag-netic field-line structures in a helical fusion reactor configuration. Using identical training data sampled from exact solutions, we perform comparisons under matched mean squared error (MSE) levels. Visualization of magnetic field lines reveals that standard PINNs may exhibit structural collapse across magnetic surfaces even when the MSE is sufficiently small, whereas Trefftz-PINNs successfully preserve the global topology of magnetic field lines. Furthermore, the proposed framework is extended to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, where streamline structures of veloc-ity fields are analyzed. Similar tendencies are observed, demonstrating that Trefftz-PINNs provide superior structure preservation compared to standard PINNs. These results indicate that minimizing numerical error alone does not guarantee physical consistency, and that constraining the solution space prior to learning is an effective strategy for physics-consistent surrogate modeling."}

Provided a function satisfies the corresponding bandwidth constraints, it can be accurately approximated within this framework. The proposed framework is notably more powerful than classical theory -- it not only provides systematic guidance for choosing the optimal scaling factor, but also predicts root-exponential and other intricate convergence behaviors that classical approaches fail to capture. Leveraging this framework, we conducted a detailed comparative study of Hermite and Laguerre approximations. We find that functions with similar decay and oscillation characteristics may nonetheless display markedly different convergence rates. Furthermore, approximations based on two concatenated sets of Laguerre functions may offer significant advantages over those using a single set of Hermite functions."}

NHCS employs a two-phase training strategy. In the first phase, DEC operators are learned through relative residual minimization from data. In the second phase, these operators are integrated into the iterative solver, and training targets the improvement of convergence through learned corrective updates that remain effective even for inaccurate intermediate solutions. This staggered training enables stable, progressive refinement while maintaining the structure-preserving properties of DEC discretizations. To improve multiscale adaptivity, NHCS introduces a convolutional neural network-based correction term capable of capturing fine-scale solution features via localized updates informed by global context, improving scalability over mesh component-wise neural approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost by avoiding Newton-Raphson-based training and the associated Jacobian evaluations of parameterized operators.

In this work, we study two approaches aimed at improving the symmetry properties of such an approximation scheme: one based on a quadrature rule for the Haar measure on the compact Lie group encoding the continuous symmetry of interest and one based on a random sampling of that Haar measure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the quadrature augmentation leads to exact symmetry preservation in polynomial models, while the random augmentation has only square-root convergence of the symmetrization error."}

This work presents a detailed investigation of the effects of static magnetic islands on ITG instability, relevant to the ADITYA-U tokamak, using the Global Gyrokinetic Code in Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3), a particle-in-cell (PIC) framework that employs a neural-network-assisted projection scheme. A two-phase simulation strategy is adopted. In the first phase, static magnetic islands with mode numbers (m, n) = (2, 1) and (3, 1) are introduced by perturbing the equilibrium magnetic flux functions. Particle dynamics within these modified topologies result in the flattening of plasma density profiles in the island regions, confirming island formation and its impact on the equilibrium profiles. In the second phase, the flattened profiles serve as new equilibria for linear electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations with adiabatic electrons, enabling the study of the modified ITG behavior. Magnetic islands significantly restructure the ITG mode, producing a spatial redistribution of potential fluctuations within and around the island region. Moreover, as the island width increases, the growth rates of different toroidal ITG modes converge, suggesting a universal stabilization trend. A comparison between the (2,1) and (3,1) islands indicates that higher-q islands lead to a more spatially extended ITG mode structure, reflecting the longer magnetic connection lengths and weaker curvature drive at outer flux surfaces. These results demonstrate the pivotal role of island-induced equilibrium modifications in determining ITG stability and mode structure in tokamak plasmas."}

These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys."}

While large-scale atmospheric fields provide important environmental context, their ability to localize extreme rainfall events is fundamentally limited. In this study, we examine how large-scale atmospheric information from ERA5 reanalysis can be leveraged for event-level probabilistic prediction of daily rainfall extremes over India. We compare an adaptive ConvLSTM baseline with a proposed Physics-Gated Latent Ordinary Differential Equation (PG-LODE) framework, which models atmospheric evolution as a continuous-time latent process whose dynamics are explicitly modulated by a physics-based gating mechanism under convectively unstable conditions. Extreme events are defined using the local 95th percentile of the India Meteorological Department gridded rainfall dataset during the June to September monsoon season. Pixel-wise evaluation shows limited skill for both models due to spatial displacement errors, whereas event-level tile-based verification reveals a clear performance contrast. The ConvLSTM remains highly conservative, detecting only 27 percent of extreme events, while PG-LODE achieves near-complete detection with a substantially higher critical success index and a moderate false alarm rate. These results demonstrate that physics-gated continuous-time latent dynamics offer a robust pathway for translating large-scale atmospheric predictability into reliable assessments of extreme rainfall risk."}

Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities."}

In this work, we propose the Physics-Driven Orthogonal Feature Method (PD-OFM), a framework for constructing feature representations that are explicitly tailored to both the differential operator and the computational domain by pretraining features using physics-informed objectives together with orthogonality regularization. This pretraining strategy yields nearly orthogonal feature bases. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that physics-informed pretraining improves the approximation capability of the learned feature space. When employed to solve Helmholtz, Poisson, wave, and Navier-Stokes equations, the proposed method achieves residual errors 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those of comparable methods. Furthermore, the orthogonality regularization improves transferability, enabling pretrained features to generalize effectively across different source terms and domain geometries for the same PDE."}

In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm.

Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics."}

In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\\sim$20-70\\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems.

Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal.

In two dimensions, stochastic representations (Feynman--Kac and stochastic characteristics for linear advection--diffusion with prescribed drift) motivate Monte Carlo solvers and provide intuition for uncertainty propagation. In three dimensions, we formulate stochastic Navier--Stokes models and describe particle-based and ensemble-based Bayesian workflows for uncertainty propagation in spectral discretizations.

In structural applications, such twins aim to identify spatially distributed quantities--such as elementwise weakening fields, material parameters, or effective thermal loads--by minimizing discrepancies between measured and simulated responses subject to the governing equations of structural mechanics. While adjoint-based methods enable efficient gradient computation for these inverse problems, the quality and stability of the resulting estimates depend critically on the choice of sensor locations, measurement types, and directions.\n  This paper develops a rigorous and implementation-ready framework for Fisher-information-based sensor placement in adjoint-based finite-element digital twins. Sensor configurations are evaluated using a D-optimal design criterion derived from a linearization of the measurement map, yielding a statistically meaningful measure of information content. We present matrix-free operator formulas for applying the Jacobian and its adjoint, and hence for computing Fisher-information products $Fv = J^\\top R^{-1} Jv$ using only forward and adjoint solves. Building on these operator evaluations, we derive explicit sensitivity expressions for D-optimal sensor design with respect to measurement parameters and discuss practical strategies for evaluating the associated log-determinant objectives. To complement the general framework, we provide analytically tractable sensor placement results for a canonical one-dimensional structural model, clarifying the distinction between detectability and localizability and proving that D-optimal placement of multiple displacement sensors yields approximately uniform spacing."}

We present \\textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention.

We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\\times$ forward-pass and $161\\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks.

We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework.

We investigate a stochastic interacting particle system governed by potential-driven interactions and its continuum density formulation in the large-population limit. We introduce an energy functional and show that the macroscopic density evolution has a gradient-flow structure in the Wasserstein-2 space. The associated variational framework yields equilibrium states through constrained energy minimization and illustrates how noise regulates the density and mitigates singular concentration. We demonstrate the connection between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions through numerical examples in one and two dimensions.

We provide an improved analysis of this algorithm, which preserves the accelerated convergence rate under much milder conditions on the perturbations. We show that our new analysis is worst-case optimal, in the sense that the convergence rate cannot be improved, and that the noise conditions we derive cannot be relaxed without sacrificing convergence guarantees.

We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements.

For an open set $\\mathcal O$, a set $Z$ is a domain of determination when the values of solutions of the differential equation $Pu=0$ are determined on $Z$ by their values in $\\mathcal O$. Fritz John's global Hölmgren theorem implies that points that can be reached by deformations of noncharacteristic hypersufaces with initial surface and boundaries in $\\mathcal O$ belong to a domain of determination provided that local uniqueness holds at noncharacteristic surfaces. Using spacelike hypersurfaces yields sharp finite speed results whose domains of determination are described in terms of influence curves that never exceed the local speed of propagation. This paper studies deformations of noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces. We prove that points reachable by (repeated) deformations by noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces coincide exactly with the set of points reachable by (repeated) homotopies of timelike arcs whose initial curves and endpoints belong to $\\mathcal O$. When the set $\\mathcal O$ is a small neighborhood of a forward timelike arc connecting $a$ to $b$, a natural candidate for $Z$ is the intesection of the future of $a$ with the past of $b$. This candidate is exact for D'Alembert's equation. We prove that it is also exact when $a,b$ are points close together on a fixed timelike arc. The timelike homotopy criterion fuels the construction of surprising examples for which the domain of determination is strictly larger (resp. strictly smaller) than the future-intersect-past candidate."}
