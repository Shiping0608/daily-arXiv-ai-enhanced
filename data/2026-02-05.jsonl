In this paper we detail a new Julia-based implementation that\n  has two important techniques: (1) a general purpose higher-order automatic differentiation engine for derivative evaluation with low overhead; (2) a combined symbolic-numeric approach to generate code for recursively computing the Taylor polynomial of the ODE solution. We demonstrate that the resulting software's compiler-based tooling is transparent to the user, requiring no changes from interfaces required to use standard explicit Runge-Kutta methods, while achieving better run time performance. In addition, we also developed a comprehensive adaptive time and order algorithm that uses different step size and polynomial degree across the integration period, which makes this implementation more efficient and versatile in a broad range of dynamics. We show that for codes compatible with compiler transformations, these integrators are more efficient and robust than the traditionally used explicit Runge-Kutta methods."}

The proposed inversion scheme permits the recovery of the $Θ$-convex support domain from far-field data at sparse observation directions. Uniqueness in determining the convex hull of the support and the excitation instants-using all observation directions-is also established as a direct consequence of the factorization method.

Here, we investigate how boundary conditions influence the design of effective $C^0$ schemes, specifically focusing on equations without lower-order terms, namely the biharmonic equation. We propose a modified mixed formulation that decomposes the problem into a system of Poisson equations, where the number of equations depends on both the largest interior angle and the boundary conditions on its two adjacent sides. In contrast to the naive mixed formulation, which involves only two Poisson problems, the proposed approach guarantees convergence to the true solution for arbitrary polygonal domains and general boundary conditions, including Navier, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. $C^0$ finite element algorithms are developed, rigorous error estimates are established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the well-posedness and effectiveness of the proposed method."}

From a computational scientist's perspective, our goal is to determine how and where we can safely exploit mixed precision computation in our codes to improve performance. One case where the use of low precision is natural, common in computational science, is when there are already other significant sources of ``inexactness'' present, e.g., discretization error, measurement error, or algorithmic approximation error. In such instances, analyzing the interaction of these different sources of inexactness can give insight into how the precisions of various computations should be chosen in order to ``balance'' the errors, potentially improving performance without a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We present a few recent examples of this approach which demonstrate the potential for the use of mixed precision in numerical linear algebra and matrix computations."}

In this study, we investigate the joint modification of normal plasma modes in ultra-relativistic electron-positron plasmas, both charge neutral and non-neutral, by the super-strong magnetic field and plasma relativistic temperature. Our analysis shows that the most substantial modification concerns the reduction of the plasma frequency cutoff, resulting in relativistic and field-induced transparency.

When finite elements are employed to approximate this problem, one solution is typically singled out by applying carefully selected boundary conditions on the discrete model or by imposing global constraints on the deformation. However, neither of these strategies is both simple and computationally efficient. In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the pure traction problem that overcomes existing limitations. Our method builds on a regularized form of the problem whose solution is shown to be unique, converges to the original solution of minimal norm, and can be approximated with finite elements in a straightforward way, without additional degrees of freedom. Additionally, we analyze the situation in which the approximation of the solution domain renders the loading of the discretized problem non-equilibrated, making the problem ill-posed. In this case, we propose a regularized predictor--corrector finite element formulation that handles the incompatibilities of the loading, providing a solution that converges to that of the original Neumann problem as the mesh size and the regularizing parameter tend to zero. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for representative problems in mechanics where pure traction boundary conditions appear."}

The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons."}

By discretizing the pressure projection equations on this conforming mesh, we can enforce velocity boundary conditions at the interface for the fluid while applying pressure forces directly on the solid boundary, enabling sharp two-way coupling between phases. The resulting method prevents fluid leakage through solids while permitting flow wherever a continuous path exists through the fluid domain.

This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations."}

Using a topological framework grounded in Morse theory and singularity theory, we make use of the result that all smooth, even double well potentials reduce near the saddle point to a canonical quartic normal form. Within this regime, the interplay of noise, synaptic bias, and potential curvature produces a topologically robust short time evolution characterized by a tanh like response.

It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps.The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression.

We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x.

The framework adopts a data-space inversion formulation to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, leading to significantly lower memory requirements and improved computational efficiency while maintaining inversion accuracy. Forward modeling and inversion operators are implemented within a backend-agnostic kernel abstraction, enabling execution on both multicore CPUs and GPU accelerators from a single code base. Performance analyses conducted on NVIDIA CUDA GPUs demonstrate substantial reductions in runtime relative to CPU execution, particularly for large-scale datasets involving up to approximately 3.3 million rectangular prisms, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach. The inversion incorporates implicit model constraints through the data-space formulation and depth-weighted sensitivity, which mitigate depth-related amplitude decay and yield geologically coherent, high-resolution subsurface density models. Validation using synthetic models confirms the ability of the framework to accurately reconstruct complex subsurface structures such as vertical and dipping dykes. Application to field gravity data further demonstrates the robustness and practical utility of the GPU-accelerated framework, with the recovered models showing strong consistency with independent geological constraints and prior interpretations.

However, the appearance of the dependence $ν(N)$ leads to a change in the type of the system, it loses hyperbolicity, which leads to computational problems. In this paper, we propose a new implicit solution method in Euler variables that overcomes these difficulties. It can be used in both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases and is tested for the threshold case of a linear dependence $ν(N)=ν_1+ν_0 N$, when smoothness can still be lost. The computational experiments carried out are in full agreement with the available theoretical results."}

They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs."}

By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence."}

The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF.

Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR.

We study the following inner product of eigenfunctions \\[\n  \\langle e_{i_1} e_{i_2} \\ldots e_{i_k}, e_{i_{k+1}} \\rangle = \\int e_{i_1} e_{i_2}\\ldots e_{i_k} \\overline{e_{i_{k+1}}} \\, dV. \\] We show that, after a mild averaging in the frequency variables, the main $\\ell^2$-concentration of this inner product is determined by the measure of a set of configurations of $(k+1)$-gons whose side lengths are the frequencies $λ_{i_1}, λ_{i_2}, \\dots, λ_{i_{k+1}}$. We prove that a rapidly vanishing proportion of this mass lies in the regime where $λ_{i_1}, λ_{i_2}, \\dots, λ_{i_{k+1}}$ cannot occur as the side lengths of any $(k+1)$-gon."}

Due to the essential difficulty that there exists no nontrivial translation-invariant measure in infinite dimensions, it is hard to obtain its infinite-dimensional counterparts. In this paper, using infinite-dimensional analogues of the classical techniques of truncation, boundary straightening, and partition of unity, we prove that smooth cylinder functions are dense in $W^{m,p}(O)$. Consequently, $H^{m,p}(O) = W^{m,p}(O)$ holds for any $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $p \\in [1, \\infty)$, and open subset $O$ of $\\ell^2$ with a suitable boundary.

They proved sequential convergence of the flow for initial metrics with positive scalar curvature and $Q$-curvature, provided the energy was sufficiently small.\n  In this paper, we prove the global convergence of the flow for arbitrary initial energy under the same positivity assumptions by establishing a non-local version of the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient along the flow.\n  We construct test bubbles and estimate their Paneitz-Sobolev quotients, a strategy that was carried out in the celebrated work of Brendle in the context of the Yamabe flow. We develop a more geometric and systematic proof that addresses the algebraic and computational complexity inherent in the $Q$-curvature and the Paneitz operator. Along the way, we derive a stability inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient using a higher-order Koiso-Bochner formula established in recent work of Bahuaud, Guenther, Isenberg, and Mazzeo."}

The methods developed here are sufficiently flexible to handle homogeneous, non-homogeneous and anisotropic weights, providing a unified approach to various endpoint cases in interpolation theory."}
