Submitted to IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis", "summary": "We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 < epsilon << 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time.

In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution.

The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated.

Within suitably generalized concepts of solvability, global existence of solutions is shown without any size restrictions on the data, and for a system actually more general than ($\\star$) by, inter alia, allowing the heat capacity $\u03ba$ to depend on $\u0398$. Apart from that, results on large time behavior are derived which particularly assert stabilization of $\u0398$ toward a spatially homogeneous limit.\n  Besides on standard features related to energy conservation and entropy production, in its core parts the analysis relies on an evolution property of certain logarithmic refinements of classical entropy functionals, to the best of our knowledge undiscovered in precedent literature and possibly of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Global existence of solutions for small-strain thermoviscoelastic evolution in Kelvin-Voigt materials without size restrictions on initial data, with results on large-time behavior and temperature stabilization.", "motivation": "Addresses a long-standing open problem in continuum mechanics: determining global solvability of the thermoviscoelastic evolution model for Kelvin-Voigt materials with inertia in multi-dimensional settings for arbitrary initial data size.", "method": "Studies initial value problem in smoothly bounded n-dimensional domains (n\u22652) with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for displacement and Neumann for temperature.
