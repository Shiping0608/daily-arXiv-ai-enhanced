Submitted to IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis", "summary": "We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 < epsilon << 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime."}

Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation."}

We introduce two types of networks, FD-CON and FE-CON, which use residual-based loss functions derived from the corresponding numerical methods. We derive error estimates for FD-CON and FE-CON using finite difference and finite element analysis. These estimates show a direct relation between the convergence behavior and the decay rate of the training loss. From these analyses, we establish training strategies that guarantee optimal convergence rates under grid refinement.

In Z-pinch geometry, we show that, like the edge pedestal in tokamak devices, this transport barrier -- which we call the ``MHD pedestal'' -- is metastable, i.e., unstable to finite-amplitude displacements of flux tubes. We simulate the slow formation of an MHD pedestal in a heated and sheared Z-pinch, which collapses on reaching a critical height, expelling an order-unity fraction of the confined thermal energy. The MHD pedestal then rebuilds and the process repeats, in a manner analogous to the ELM cycle seen in fusion experiments. We show that the available energy of the metastable equilibrium, and the most energetically favorable amount of ejected plasma, can be calculated from first principles via combinatorial optimization of flux-tube interchanges."}

Extremal solutions are $N$-soliton solutions that achieve the theoretical maximal amplitude and diverge as $N \\to \\infty$. We consider extremal solutions with the discrete eigenvalues randomly drawn from sub-exponential distributions, and identify two distinct universality classes, determined by the macroscopic structure of the spectrum: the Painlevé--III rogue-wave solution, where the eigenvalues take the form $λ_j = v_j + i μ_j$, and the Painlevé--V rogue wave solution, where $λ_j = -ζ\\, j + v_j + i μ_j$, with $0 < ζ< 1$. (In both cases, $μ_{j}$ and $v_{j}$ are subexponential random variables.) Universality can then be summarized as follows: independently of the specific distribution of the eigenvalues, the rescaled solutions converge locally to a deterministic profile governed by the Painlevé-III equation in the first regime, and the Painlevé-V equation in the second. These results demonstrate that the formation of Painlevé-type rogue waves is a universal phenomenon robust to randomness."}

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces."}

In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes."}

To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency.

To overcome these difficulties, instead of directly considering the HSM inequality on the upper half space, we establish the existence of an extremal for its equivalent version: Poincaré-Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space. We develop a novel duality theory of the minimizing sequences, the concentration-compactness principle for radial functions in the hyperbolic setting, which combines with the Helgason-Fourier analysis and the Riesz rearrangement inequality on the hyperbolic space, to resolve the lack of compactness issue. As an application, we also obtain the existence of positive symmetric solutions for the high order Brezis-Nirenberg equation on the entire hyperbolic space associated with the GJMS operators $P_k$ (i.e., when $k\\ge 2$): $$ P_{k}\\left(f\\right)-αf=|f|^{p-2}f $$ at the critical situation $α=\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{\\left(2i-1\\right)^2}{4}$ when either $2k+2\\leq n$ and $p=\\frac{2n}{n-2k}$ or $2k<n$ and $2<p<\\frac{2n}{n-2k}$."}

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases."}

We compare implementations using the analytic Frechet derivative of this map with a simple central-difference approximation. Because the method does not rely on time evolution, it is agnostic to dynamical stability and can detect both stable and unstable stationary states. Its accuracy is determined mainly by the numerical treatment of convolutions and quadrature, rather than by differentiation stencils.

Determining correlation lengths from magnetic field time series in magnetic clouds is complicated by the presence of the global flux rope: without removal of the flux rope trend, correlation length measurements will be sensitive to the flux rope as well as the turbulence, and give overestimates of the outer scale when turbulence amplitudes at the outer scale are small relative to the flux rope amplitude. We have used force-free flux rope fits to detrend magnetic field time series measured by Parker Solar Probe in two magnetic clouds and calculated the turbulence correlation length in the clouds using the detrended data. The detrended correlation length in terms of the proton inertial length, $d_p$, was $2.7\\times10^{4} d_p$ in one cloud (observed at 0.77 au) and $1.6\\times10^{4}d_p$ in the other (observed at 0.39 au), significantly smaller than the values obtained without detrending.

Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation.

Inspired by recent works of Feng et al. \\cite{fb20} and Long et al. \\cite{fb5}, we propose a new free boundary condition, where the expansion rate of the epidemic region, determined by $h'(t)$ and $g'(t)$, is proportional to a linear combination of the outward flux of the pathogen \\(u\\) through the range boundary (as in \\cite{fb27}) and the weighted total population of infected individuals \\(v\\) within the region (as in \\cite{fb5}).

In the initialization step, a satisisfactory based approximation is obtained by minimizing the original nonconvex residual, typically stagnating at a moderate accuracy level. Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau.

We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation.

Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier."}

We consider a conceptualized one-dimensional device, containing a cancer and a population of white blood cells. The interaction between the cancer and the population of cells is modeled by a chemotaxis model inspired by Keller-Segel-type equations, which is solved by a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin method. Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest."}

This phenomenon is demonstrated by a careful analysis of the representation formula for the Stokes system in the half-space, including pointwise estimates, based on the Green tensor with nonzero boundary data. We construct solutions of the Stokes system such that the tangential components of the velocity field exhibit at least one sign change, while the normal component exhibits at least two sign changes. Moreover, the normal component of the constructed velocity field has the opposite sign to the tangential components near the boundary, whereas it has the same sign as the tangential components sufficiently far from the boundary."}

A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions."}

The model is considered on a bounded interval with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data and a prescribed history function. To accommodate the loss of global smoothness in time caused by delay terms, solutions are understood in a \\textit{stepwise classical sense}, allowing jump discontinuities in the second time derivative at multiples of the delay while maintaining continuity of the solution and its first time derivative.\n  By combining separation of variables with Sturm-Liouville expansions, the delayed PDE is reduced to a family of scalar second-order delay differential equations. Using delay-dependent fundamental solutions, we derive closed-form representation formulas for the modal dynamics and reconstruct the PDE solution as a Fourier series. Convergence conditions guaranteeing uniform convergence and admissibility of termwise differentiation in space are established. A numerical example demonstrates the practical computation of truncated series solutions and their visualization."}

These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections.
