In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength.

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles.

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation.

The free boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$ evolve subject to a ``preferred population density\" condition at the habitat edges. Analogous to the traveling wave solutions in the corresponding Cauchy problem, semi-wave solutions play a fundamental role in understanding the propagation phenomena governed by the free boundary problem here. But in contrast to the Cauchy problem, where the KPP condition plays a subtle role in the precise approximation of its solution (with compactly supported initial function) by the traveling wave solution with minimal speed, here we prove the existence and uniqueness of a semi-wave in a general monostable setting, and obtain a precise description of the convergence of the solution toward the semi-wave as time goes to infinity, where the KPP condition plays no special role. Previously, such a sharp result was proved for a free boundary model only when $f$ is autonomous ($f=f(u)$, see \\cite{D} or \\cite{DL15} for a related free boundary model), or a less precise result was obtained in the time-periodic case under an extra strong KPP condition on $f$ (see \\cite{MDW}, or \\cite{DGP} for a related free boundary model).

Here, we propose and assess a dynamic, term-by-term VMS stabilized formulation for simulating incompressible flows from laminar to turbulent regimes. The method is embedded in an incremental pressure-correction fractional-step framework and employs a minimal set of stabilization terms, yielding a unified discretization that (i) allows equal-order velocity--pressure interpolation and (ii) provides robust control of convection-dominated dynamics in complex three-dimensional settings. Orthogonal projections are a key ingredient and ensure that the non-residual, term-by-term structure induces dissipation through dynamic subscales suitable for turbulent simulations. The methodology is validated on large-scale external-aerodynamics configurations, including the Ahmed body at Re $ = 7.68\\times 10^{5}$ for multiple slant angles, using unstructured tetrahedral meshes ranging from 3 to 40 million elements. Applicability is further demonstrated on a realistic Formula~1 configuration at $U_\\infty=56~\\mathrm{m/s}$ (201.6~km/h), corresponding to Re $ \\approx 10^{6}$. The results show that the proposed stabilized pressure-segregated formulation remains robust at scale and captures key separated-flow features and coherent wake organization. Pointwise velocity and pressure spectra provide an a posteriori consistency indicator, exhibiting finite frequency ranges compatible with inertial-subrange reference slopes in the resolved band and supporting dissipation control in under-resolved regimes within a unified stabilized finite element framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "A dynamic term-by-term VMS stabilized formulation for incompressible flows from laminar to turbulent regimes, validated on large-scale aerodynamics using unstructured meshes up to 40M elements.", "motivation": "To develop a unified stabilized finite element framework that handles under-resolved flow scales without problem-specific turbulence models, working across laminar to turbulent regimes in complex 3D settings.", "method": "Dynamic term-by-term VMS formulation embedded in incremental pressure-correction fractional-step framework with orthogonal projections, minimal stabilization terms, allowing equal-order velocity-pressure interpolation.", "result": "Method validated on Ahmed body at Re=7.68\u00d710\u2075 with multiple slant angles using 3-40M element meshes, and on Formula 1 configuration at Re\u224810\u2076, showing robust performance at scale and capturing separated-flow features.", "conclusion": "The proposed stabilized pressure-segregated formulation provides robust control of convection-dominated dynamics, captures key flow features, and offers consistent dissipation control in under-resolved regimes within a unified framework."}}

The key step is to show that these three assumptions imply the so called cutoff Sobolev inequality, an important inequality in the study of anomalous diffusions, Dirichlet forms and re-scaled energies in fractals. This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\\in (1,\\infty)$.
