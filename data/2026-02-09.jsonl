Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.\n  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach."}

By applying this framework to point clouds or samples of smooth manifolds (hypersurfaces, in particular), we show how fundamental geometric quantities such as tangent plane and principal curvatures can be computed numerically using a kernel based (approximate) level set function (often a defining function) for smooth hypersurfaces. In the case of point clouds, the approach generates an interpolated hypersurface, which is an approximation of the underlying manifold when the cloud is a sample of it. It is shown how the geometric quantities obtained can be used in the numerical approximation/computation of geometric operators like the surface gradient or the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the spirit of kernel based meshfree methods. Kernel based interpolation can be extremely ill-posed, especially when using smooth kernels, and the regression approximation offers a natural regularization that proves also quite useful when dealing with geometric or functional data that are affected by errors or noise."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation study comparing Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) from standard flat foils and novel annular sector (C-shaped) targets. Under identical ultra-intense laser irradiation (a0=10, tau=25 fs), the annular sector geometry demonstrates a substantial enhancement in acceleration performance driven by two synergistic mechanisms: electromagnetic cavity confinement and geometric plasma focusing. Our analysis reveals that the target void acts as an optical trap, sustaining oscillating electromagnetic fields for over 300fs via multiple internal reflections. This confinement results in a total laser energy absorption of 49% (compared to 16% for flat targets), which yields a peak electron temperature of 5.1 MeV more than double the 2.2MeV observed in flat targets. Furthermore, phase space diagnostics confirm that ion bunches accelerated from the converging cavity walls superimpose at the geometric center, creating a localized high-density focal spot. Consequently, the annular target increases the proton cut-off energy to 22MeV (vs. 12MeV for flat targets) and boosts Carbon ion energies beyond 60MeV. These findings establish that tailoring target curvature to exploit optical trapping and geometric focusing offers a robust pathway for developing compact, high-efficiency laser-ion sources."}

In body-dominated motions, where the fluid dynamics are primarily driven by prescribed plate accelerations, the inviscid model accurately reproduces normal force histories and the qualitative structure of the induced vorticity field. In flow-dominated configurations, with quasi-periodic vortex shedding, agreement with force predictions is good but reduced at low angles of attack, reflecting the greater sensitivity of vortex shedding dynamics to physical and computational parameters. The ability of the present formulation to accommodate stable, continuous leading-edge vortex shedding enables uniform comparisons across diverse motions and clarifies the regimes in which inviscid vortex sheet models can be used reliably for force prediction and physical interpretation."}

For wave numbers that are not transmission eigenvalues any incident wave leads to scattering, however, being at a transmission eigenvalue is far from su!cient to guarantee the occurence of non-scattering for even a single incident wave. For instance the inhomogeneity generically has to be smooth for non-scattering to occur. Similarly many smooth geometric shapes will be scattering for natural incident waves even at a transmission eigenvalue. Part of the survey discusses recent results of that nature."}

In the simulation with no ambient plasma, the rarefaction waves interpenetrate near the symmetry line between both rarefaction wave centers. The exponential density decrease of rarefaction waves with distance implies that the sum of their density does not lead to a density maximum near the symmetry line. The absence of a density maximum, which would yield a repelling electric potential for the inflowing rarefaction wave ions near the symmetry line, and the high interpenetration speed of the ion beams lead to ion-ion instabilities rather than shocks in the overlap layer. The simulations with ambient plasma show that the rarefaction waves pile up the ions of the ambient plasma near the symmetry line. A localized piston of hot ambient ions forms. If its density is large enough, its thermoelectric field allows reverse shocks to grow in the rarefaction waves. These reverse shocks move slowly in the simulation frame and enclose a slab of downstream plasma. A decrease in the speed of the rarefaction wave ions upstream of the shocks with time leads to their collapse."}

A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons.

The primary numerical challenges arise from the dual nature of the oscillations: the spatial oscillations inherent in the semiclassical limit and the high-frequency oscillations in the random space induced by uncertainties. We extend two robust integrators -- the projector-splitting integrator and the unconventional integrator -- to the semiclassical regime to evolve the solution on a low-rank manifold. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DLR method is significantly more computationally efficient than the standard stochastic Galerkin method, as it captures the essential quantum dynamics using a much smaller number of basis functions. Our findings reveal that despite the complex oscillatory patterns of the wave function, its evolution remains concentrated in a low-rank subspace for the cases investigated. Specifically, we observe that the DLR method achieves high fidelity with a remarkably small numerical rank, which remains robust even as the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$ decreases. Within our problem settings, the results further suggest that the rank growth is primarily driven by the randomness and regularity of the potential.

In this paper, we provide evidence that performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies, even when the neural architecture is fixed. Through a detailed study of a DeepONet-based hybrid iterative numerical transferable solver (HINTS) and an FFT-based Fourier neural solver (FNS), we show that significant physical residuals can persist when training objectives are not aligned with solver dynamics and problem physics. We further examine Anderson acceleration (AA) and demonstrate that its classical form is ill-suited for nonlinear neural operators. To overcome this, we introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA), which minimizes the physical residual rather than the fixed-point update. Numerical experiments confirm that PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations.

Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis.

We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system."}

In this work, we demonstrate the global existence of strong solutions in the whole space case, without assuming the initial density to be small and regular: it suffices for it to be bounded and for the total mass to be finite. In passing, we obtain optimal decay estimates for the energy and dissipation functionals. As a corollary, we get a long-time description of the density.

The present stability result is similar to that proposed by one of us for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation \\cite{glosta}; it is derived from a suitable formulation of the MHD equations proposed in our previous work \\cite{MHD}, emphasizing strong structural analogies with the NS case. A basic tool in the proof of the present stability result is a general theory of approximate solutions of the MHD Cauchy problem, that we developed in \\cite{MHD} on the grounds of previous results on the NS equation \\cite{smooth} and of the above structural similarities. We also introduce a class of Beltrami-type initial data for the MHD equations; although being arbitrarily large, these data produce global and decaying MHD solutions, fitting the framework of the present stability result. Comparisons with the previous literature on these subjects are performed."}

Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.\n  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach."}

We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations."}

Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $δ\\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \\[ Ψ(t)=\\frac{t^δ}δ, \\] and prove that every $C_0$--$δ$--semigroup $\\mathcal S_δ$ admits the representation \\[ \\mathcal S_δ(t)=\\mathcal T(Ψ(t)), \\] where $\\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $δ$--generator of $\\mathcal S_δ$ coincides with the generator of $\\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=Ψ(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $δ$--hypercyclicity and $δ$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,δ}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time."}
