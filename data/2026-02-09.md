### [1] [The modulated Fourier expansion for waves propagating through time-modulated media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06152)
*Jörg Nick*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Develops a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE) method for time-modulated acoustic wave equations, enabling stable numerical integration with larger time steps compared to direct approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-modulated materials enable new acoustic/electrical devices but break classical properties (reciprocity, energy conservation), making mathematical analysis difficult. Standard time-harmonic formulations fail without a limiting amplitude principle.

Method: Uses modulated Fourier expansion (MFE) to characterize solutions via multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions that solve a coupled system of evolutionary PDEs with constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system has smooth solutions approximating exact solutions with small defects.

Result: Discretization of the derived coupled system yields stable, accurate integrators that allow larger time steps than direct schemes applied to time-modulated acoustic wave equations. Numerical experiments validate theoretical results.

Conclusion: The MFE approach provides an effective alternative tool for analyzing time-modulated acoustic wave equations, overcoming limitations of classical methods and enabling efficient numerical simulation with improved stability and larger time steps.

Abstract: Controlling waves by actively changing the material parameters of a medium enables the development of new acoustic and electrical devices. Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.
  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach.

### [2] [Geometric Kernel Interpolation and Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06284)
*Patrick Guidotti*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper connects kernel interpolation and regression, showing interpolation as a limiting case of regression, and applies this to compute geometric quantities from point clouds or manifold samples using kernel-based level set functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a direct connection between kernel interpolation and regression, and to develop a kernel-based framework for computing geometric quantities from point clouds or manifold samples that can handle noisy data through regularization.

Method: Uses variational interpretation of kernel interpolation to show interpolation as a limiting case of regression. Applies kernel-based approximate level set functions to point clouds/manifold samples to compute geometric quantities like tangent planes and principal curvatures. Uses regression as natural regularization for ill-posed interpolation problems.

Result: Demonstrates how fundamental geometric quantities can be computed numerically from point clouds using kernel-based level set functions. Shows how these geometric quantities can be used to approximate geometric operators like surface gradient and Laplace-Beltrami operator in meshfree methods.

Conclusion: The regression approximation provides natural regularization for kernel-based interpolation, making it useful for handling noisy geometric or functional data, while enabling computation of geometric quantities and operators from point clouds or manifold samples.

Abstract: Exploiting the variational interpretation of kernel interpolation we exhibit a direct connection between interpolation and regression, where interpolation appears as a limiting case of regression. By applying this framework to point clouds or samples of smooth manifolds (hypersurfaces, in particular), we show how fundamental geometric quantities such as tangent plane and principal curvatures can be computed numerically using a kernel based (approximate) level set function (often a defining function) for smooth hypersurfaces. In the case of point clouds, the approach generates an interpolated hypersurface, which is an approximation of the underlying manifold when the cloud is a sample of it. It is shown how the geometric quantities obtained can be used in the numerical approximation/computation of geometric operators like the surface gradient or the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the spirit of kernel based meshfree methods. Kernel based interpolation can be extremely ill-posed, especially when using smooth kernels, and the regression approximation offers a natural regularization that proves also quite useful when dealing with geometric or functional data that are affected by errors or noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient numerical methods for stochastic diffusion systems where drift and diffusion coefficients are locally Lipschitz continuous and may exhibit polynomial growth, which poses challenges for standard time-stepping schemes.

Method: An adaptive time-stepping method that controls the growth of both drift and diffusion coefficients through state-dependent adaptive timestep selection, establishing strong convergence with optimal order 1/2.

Result: The proposed scheme achieves optimal 1/2 order strong convergence and demonstrates improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods like tamed EM, truncated EM, and backward EM schemes.

Conclusion: The adaptive time-stepping scheme provides an efficient numerical solution for stiff, non-stiff, and high-dimensional stochastic diffusion systems with locally Lipschitz coefficients and polynomial growth, validated through numerical experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive time-stepping mothods for stochastic diffusion systems whose drift and diffusion coefficients are locally Lipschitz continuous and may exhibit polynomial growth. By controlling the growth of both the drift and diffusion coefficients, we give the choice of the state-dependent adaptive timestep and establish strong convergence of the proposed scheme with the optimal order $1/2$. The performance of the adaptive time-stepping scheme is compared with several widely used explicit and implicit schemes, including tamed EM, truncated EM, and backward EM schemes. Numerical experiments on stiff, non-stiff and high-dimensional stochastic diffusion systems verify the improved computational efficiency of the proposed scheme and validate the theoretical results.

TL;DR: The paper develops an entropy stable nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for shallow water moment equations, proving entropy conservation/dissipation properties and constructing well-balanced numerical schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust numerical methods for shallow water moment equations that preserve important physical properties like entropy conservation/dissipation and maintain well-balanced characteristics.

Method: 1) Prove shallow water moment equations satisfy auxiliary entropy conservation law with total energy as entropy function. 2) Show Newtonian slip friction and Manning friction are entropy dissipative. 3) Construct entropy stable nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method using entropy conservative numerical fluxes that satisfy discrete entropy flux compatibility condition.

Result: Successfully developed an entropy stable and well-balanced numerical scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate scheme performance and validate theoretical entropy conservation/dissipation properties.

Conclusion: The paper establishes rigorous entropy analysis for shallow water moment equations and provides a practical, entropy stable numerical method that preserves important physical properties while handling friction terms appropriately.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the shallow water moment equations satisfy an auxiliary entropy conservation law, where the entropy function corresponds to the total energy. Additionally, we show that the classical Newtonian slip friction and Manning friction terms are entropy dissipative with respect to the developed entropy variables. The results from the continuous entropy analysis are used to construct an entropy stable and well-balanced nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the spatial approximation. Key to ensure the entropy stability of the scheme is the derivation of entropy conservative numerical fluxes that satisfy a discrete version of the entropy flux compatibility condition. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the scheme and validate the theoretical results.

We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and computational advantages of the proposed approach on benchmark problems. The results highlight the potential of dynamically evolving reduced bases to achieve accurate filtering and parameter estimation at reduced computational cost.

### [6] [On the Role of the Double Fourier Sphere Method in Fast Algorithms on SO(3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06677)
*Ralf Hielscher,Erik Wuensche*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method on SO(3), showing its central role in fast Fourier algorithms by interpreting the Wigner transform as an explicit realization of DFS lifting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental role of the Double Fourier Sphere method in fast Fourier algorithms on the rotation group SO(3), and to analyze the regularity properties and computational efficiency of different implementations.

Method: Reinterpret the Wigner transform (mapping harmonic to Fourier coefficients) as an explicit realization of the DFS method, which lifts functions from SO(3) to the 3-torus. Analyze Sobolev regularity loss from this lifting, compare different Wigner transform implementations, and examine symmetry enhancements.

Result: The direct method for Wigner transform is often faster and more stable than fast polynomial transform approaches. The paper provides frequency-domain analysis of DFS on SO(3) and quantifies the Sobolev regularity loss induced by the lifting.

Conclusion: The DFS method plays a central role in fast Fourier algorithms on SO(3), with the Wigner transform serving as its explicit realization. Direct computational methods outperform fast polynomial transforms in speed and stability for these applications.

Abstract: We analyze the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method on the rotation group $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ in the frequency domain and demonstrate its central role in fast algorithms. Fast Fourier algorithms on $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ are commonly formulated as a Wigner transform - mapping harmonic to Fourier coefficients - followed by a Fourier transform. We revisit this formulation and interpret the Wigner transform as an explicit realization of the DFS method, lifting functions from $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ to $\mathbb{T}^3$. In this context, we analyze the Sobolev regularity loss induced by this lifting. Furthermore, we compare different Wigner transform implementations, examine additional symmetry enhancements, and observe that the direct method is often faster and more stable than the fast polynomial transform approaches.

### [7] [Laguerre-Sobolev orthogonal Polynomials and Boundary Value Problems on a semi-infinite domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06685)
*Cleonice F. Bracciali,Miguel A. Piñar*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Laguerre-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are developed for spectral approximation of Schrödinger-type problems with singular potentials, featuring explicit formulas, recurrence relations, and a fully diagonalized spectral method with exponential convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient spectral methods for solving Schrödinger-type boundary value problems with singular potentials on semi-infinite intervals, which require orthogonal basis functions that vanish at endpoints and can handle singularities.

Method: Introduces Laguerre-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials associated with Sobolev inner products from second-order boundary value problems. Derives explicit connection formulas with classical Laguerre polynomials, recurrence relations, asymptotic properties, and a generating function involving Bessel functions. Develops a fully diagonalized spectral method that avoids solving linear systems and can be implemented recursively.

Result: Obtains complete mathematical framework for Laguerre-Sobolev polynomials including connection formulas, recurrence relations, and asymptotic properties. The developed spectral method achieves spectral accuracy and exponential convergence for Schrödinger-type equations with inverse-distance potentials, as confirmed by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Laguerre-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials provide an effective basis for spectral approximation of singular Schrödinger problems on semi-infinite domains, with the developed diagonalized spectral method offering computational efficiency through recursive implementation and avoiding linear system solutions.

Abstract: We study a family of Laguerre--Sobolev orthogonal polynomials associated with a Sobolev inner product arising from second--order boundary value problems on the semi--infinite interval $(0,+\infty)$. These polynomials generate an orthogonal basis of test functions vanishing at the endpoints and are especially well suited for the spectral approximation of Schrödinger--type problems with singular potentials. Explicit connection formulas with classical Laguerre polynomials are obtained, together with recurrence relations and asymptotic properties of the corresponding coefficients. A generating function involving Bessel functions is also derived. As an application, we develop a fully diagonalized Laguerre--Sobolev spectral method for Dirichlet problems with singular potentials. The method avoids the solution of linear systems and can be implemented recursively. Numerical experiments for a Schrödinger--type equation with inverse--distance potential confirm spectral accuracy and exponential convergence.

### [8] [Dynamical low-rank approximation for the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06808)
*Liu Liu,Limin Xu,Zhenyi Zhu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DLR approximation for semiclassical Schrödinger equation with uncertainties efficiently captures quantum dynamics using low-rank structure, outperforming stochastic Galerkin method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address numerical challenges from dual oscillations: spatial oscillations in semiclassical limit and high-frequency oscillations in random space from uncertainties. Need efficient methods for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in quantum systems.

Method: Extend two robust integrators (projector-splitting integrator and unconventional integrator) to semiclassical regime to evolve solution on low-rank manifold. Use dynamical low-rank approximation framework.

Result: DLR method significantly more computationally efficient than standard stochastic Galerkin method. Captures essential quantum dynamics with much smaller number of basis functions. Evolution remains concentrated in low-rank subspace despite complex oscillatory patterns. Achieves high fidelity with remarkably small numerical rank robust to decreasing ε. Rank growth primarily driven by randomness and regularity of potential.

Conclusion: Provides practical insights into low-rank structure of uncertain quantum systems. Offers efficient approach for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in semiclassical regime. Demonstrates that despite oscillations, quantum dynamics can be efficiently represented with low-rank approximations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation framework for solving the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties. The primary numerical challenges arise from the dual nature of the oscillations: the spatial oscillations inherent in the semiclassical limit and the high-frequency oscillations in the random space induced by uncertainties. We extend two robust integrators -- the projector-splitting integrator and the unconventional integrator -- to the semiclassical regime to evolve the solution on a low-rank manifold. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DLR method is significantly more computationally efficient than the standard stochastic Galerkin method, as it captures the essential quantum dynamics using a much smaller number of basis functions. Our findings reveal that despite the complex oscillatory patterns of the wave function, its evolution remains concentrated in a low-rank subspace for the cases investigated. Specifically, we observe that the DLR method achieves high fidelity with a remarkably small numerical rank, which remains robust even as the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$ decreases. Within our problem settings, the results further suggest that the rank growth is primarily driven by the randomness and regularity of the potential. These results provide practical insights into the low-rank structure of uncertain quantum systems and offer an efficient approach for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in the semiclassical regime.

### [9] [Are Deep Learning Based Hybrid PDE Solvers Reliable? Why Training Paradigms and Update Strategies Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06842)
*Yuhan Wu,Jan Willem van Beek,Victorita Dolean,Alexander Heinlein*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: DL-HIMs can stagnate at false fixed points; performance depends heavily on training paradigms and update strategies, not just architecture. Physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA) restores reliable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIMs) promise accelerated convergence by combining classical solvers with neural operators, but many stagnate at false fixed points where neural updates vanish while physical residuals remain large, raising reliability concerns for scientific computing.

Method: Study DeepONet-based HINTS and FFT-based FNS to show residual persistence when training objectives misalign with solver dynamics and physics. Examine Anderson acceleration (AA) limitations for nonlinear neural operators, then introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA) that minimizes physical residual rather than fixed-point update.

Result: Performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies even with fixed architecture. PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations compared to classical AA.

Conclusion: Reliability of AI-based PDE solvers depends not only on architectures but on physically informed training and iteration design. PA-AA provides concrete solution to false fixed point stagnation.

Abstract: Deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIMs) integrate classical numerical solvers with neural operators, utilizing their complementary spectral biases to accelerate convergence. Despite this promise, many DL-HIMs stagnate at false fixed points where neural updates vanish while the physical residual remains large, raising questions about reliability in scientific computing. In this paper, we provide evidence that performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies, even when the neural architecture is fixed. Through a detailed study of a DeepONet-based hybrid iterative numerical transferable solver (HINTS) and an FFT-based Fourier neural solver (FNS), we show that significant physical residuals can persist when training objectives are not aligned with solver dynamics and problem physics. We further examine Anderson acceleration (AA) and demonstrate that its classical form is ill-suited for nonlinear neural operators. To overcome this, we introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA), which minimizes the physical residual rather than the fixed-point update. Numerical experiments confirm that PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations. These findings provide a concrete answer to ongoing controversies surrounding AI-based PDE solvers: reliability hinges not only on architectures but on physically informed training and iteration design.

### [10] [$hp$-a posteriori error estimates for hybrid high-order methods applied to biharmonic problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06872)
*Zhaonan Dong,Alexandre Ern,Tanvi Wadhawan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Derivation of residual-based hp-a posteriori error estimator for hybrid high-order methods on simplicial meshes applied to biharmonic problems in 2D/3D polytopal domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable error estimation for HHO methods solving biharmonic problems on complex domains, requiring analysis of both conforming and nonconforming error components.

Method: Error decomposition into conforming/nonconforming components; uses C¹-partition of unity via Alfeld splittings with local Helmholtz decompositions for nonconforming error; designs two residual-based estimators with different interpolation operators.

Result: First estimator bounds conforming error using only stabilization term and data oscillation; second adds bulk residuals, normal flux jumps, and tangential jumps; numerical experiments validate theoretical efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposed hp-a posteriori error estimators are theoretically sound and numerically efficient for HHO methods on biharmonic problems in polytopal domains.

Abstract: We derive a residual-based $hp$-a posteriori error estimator for hybrid high-order (HHO) methods on simplicial meshes applied to the biharmonic problem posed on two- and three-dimensional polytopal Lipschitz domains. The a posteriori error estimator hinges on an error decomposition into conforming and nonconforming components. To bound the nonconforming error, we use a $C^1$-partition of unity constructed via Alfeld splittings, combined with local Helmholtz decompositions on vertex stars. For the conforming error, we design two residual-based estimators, each associated with a specific interpolation operator. In the first setting, the upper bound for the conforming error involves only the stabilization term and the data oscillation. In the second setting, the bound additionally incorporates bulk residuals, normal flux jumps, and tangential jumps. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed estimators.

### [11] [Transmission Eigenvalues and Non-scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06250)
*Fioralba Cakoni,Michael S. Vogelius*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Survey of recent results on scattering/non-scattering for Helmholtz equation with inhomogeneities, covering transmission eigenvalues and conditions for non-scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when wave scattering occurs vs. doesn't occur in linear Helmholtz equations with inhomogeneities, particularly focusing on transmission eigenvalues and conditions for non-scattering.

Method: Survey methodology reviewing recent research results on scattering theory for isotropic and anisotropic media, analyzing transmission spectrum and conditions for non-scattering.

Result: Transmission eigenvalues alone don't guarantee non-scattering; smoothness of inhomogeneity and specific geometric shapes are required for non-scattering to occur even at transmission eigenvalues.

Conclusion: Non-scattering is a rare phenomenon requiring specific conditions beyond just being at a transmission eigenvalue, with smooth inhomogeneities and particular geometries playing crucial roles.

Abstract: In this paper we survey some recent results concerning scattering and non-scattering in the context of the linear Helmholtz equation and inhomogeneities of nontrivial contrast. We examine isotropic as well as anisotropic media. Part of the survey deals with the so-called transmission spectrum, namely those wave numbers at which non-scattering potentially may occur. For wave numbers that are not transmission eigenvalues any incident wave leads to scattering, however, being at a transmission eigenvalue is far from su!cient to guarantee the occurence of non-scattering for even a single incident wave. For instance the inhomogeneity generically has to be smooth for non-scattering to occur. Similarly many smooth geometric shapes will be scattering for natural incident waves even at a transmission eigenvalue. Part of the survey discusses recent results of that nature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend previous half-plane results with Dirichlet boundary conditions to whole-plane MHD coupling, and generalize existing works by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density.

Method: New perspective exploiting spatial integrability of density and resulting integrability of pressure, together with specific structure of MHD system.

Result: Established global existence of weak solutions with intermediate regularity between Lions-Feireisl finite-energy solutions and Hoff's framework.

Conclusion: Successfully extended previous results to whole-plane MHD with vacuum and unbounded densities, providing new existence theory for compressible MHD equations.

Abstract: We establish the global existence of a class of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on the whole plane under a suitably small initial energy. The solutions constructed here admit far-field vacuum and unbounded densities. Moreover, they possess an intermediate regularity regime between the finite-energy weak solutions of Lions-Feireisl and the framework of Hoff. This particularly extends our previous half-plane case with Dirichlet boundary conditions (arXiv:2601.11852) to the whole-plane MHD coupling, and we also generalize the works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365-1407) and Suen and Hoff (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 205 (2012), pp. 27-58) by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density. Our analysis lies in a new perspective that exploits the spatial integrability of the density and the resulting integrability of the pressure, together with the specific structure of the MHD system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the continuity properties of the data-to-solution map for resistive MHD equations, particularly investigating how strong magnetic background fields affect the stabilization while preserving analytical features of non-uniform continuity.

Method: Mathematical analysis proving non-uniform continuity in Sobolev spaces H^s(R^d) for s>0 and d=2,3, considering perturbations around arbitrary constant background magnetic fields B_0 ∈ R^d.

Result: First studies showing non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map for resistive MHD equations, revealing that strong magnetic background fields provide stabilization effects but still preserve non-uniform continuity.

Conclusion: The data-to-solution map for incompressible MHD equations with magnetic diffusion exhibits non-uniform continuity in Sobolev spaces, and strong magnetic fields provide stabilization without eliminating this analytical feature.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map for the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only magnetic diffusion in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for all $s>0$ and $d=2,3$. Our results are first studies on the non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map for the resistive MHD equations. Moreover, our results permit the solution perturbation around an arbitrary constant background magnetic fields $\mathbf{B_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, which reveal that the strong magnetic background fields may provide the stabilization effect but still preserve the analytical feature of non-uniform continuity of the data-to-solution map.

Under the positive nonlinear Neumann boundary condition, our result extend the classification result for the second order Liouville equation in \cite{Li} from $n=2$ to general $n\geq2$, and also extend the classification result for critical $p$-Laplacian equation in \cite{Zhou} from $p<n$ to $p=n$.

### [16] [Extremal Alexandrov estimates: singularities, obstacles, and stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06468)
*Tianling Jin,Xushan Tu,Jingang Xiong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper improves classical Alexandrov estimates for convex functions, showing the 1/n exponent is not optimal when one function is non-degenerate. It proves sharp quantitative estimates comparing convex functions via Monge-Ampère measure differences, with quadratic dependence in n≥3 and logarithmic correction in n=2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical Alexandrov estimate gives sup-norm bounds with exponent 1/n for convex functions with same boundary values. This exponent is known to be optimal in general, but the paper investigates whether it remains optimal in the small-discrepancy regime when one function is non-degenerate (has Monge-Ampère density bounded above and below by positive constants).

Method: The approach involves characterizing extremizers - identifying pointwise minimizers and maximizers in the admissible class. These are realized by solutions to Monge-Ampère equations with isolated singularities (for minimizers) and solutions with linear obstacles (for maximizers). The extremal description reduces sharp estimates to precise asymptotic analysis of these model configurations. Additional analysis includes pointwise two-sided asymptotics with explicit constants under C^{2,α} and uniform convexity assumptions, and stability results for almost-extremal configurations.

Result: The paper shows the classical 1/n exponent is not optimal for small discrepancies with non-degenerate functions. It proves sharp quantitative estimates: in dimensions n≥3, optimal dependence is quadratic in the natural mass scale; in dimension n=2, optimal dependence contains a logarithmic correction. These rates are shown to be optimal for all small discrepancies. Under additional regularity assumptions, sharp pointwise two-sided asymptotics with explicit leading constants are obtained. For n≥3, a stability phenomenon is established showing that near-saturation of pointwise estimates forces measure discrepancy to concentrate near the point at natural scale.

Conclusion: The paper provides a complete understanding of optimal rates for comparing convex functions via Monge-Ampère measure differences in the small-discrepancy regime with non-degenerate reference functions. The results reveal dimension-dependent optimal exponents (quadratic for n≥3, logarithmic for n=2) that improve upon the classical 1/n bound, with applications to stability and rigidity of almost-extremal configurations.

Abstract: The classical Alexandrov estimate controls the oscillation of a convex function by the mass of its associated Monge-Ampère measure and yields, for two convex functions of $n$ variables with the same boundary values, a sup-norm bound with exponent $1/n$ in the measure discrepancy. We show that this exponent is not optimal in the small-discrepancy regime once one of the functions is non-degenerate in the sense of having Monge-Ampère density bounded above and below by two positive constants.
  We prove sharp quantitative estimates comparing two convex functions by the total variation of the difference of their Monge-Ampère measures: in dimensions $n\ge 3$ the optimal dependence is quadratic in the natural mass scale, while in dimension $n=2$ the optimal dependence contains a logarithmic correction. These rates are shown to be optimal for all small discrepancies.
  A key structural ingredient is a characterization of extremizers. We identify the pointwise minimizers and maximizers in the admissible class and prove that they are realized, respectively, by solutions to Monge-Ampère equations with an isolated singularity and by solutions to Monge-Ampère equations with a linear obstacle. This extremal description reduces the sharp estimates to a precise asymptotic analysis of these two model configurations.
  Assuming further that the domain and the non-degenerate reference function are $C^{2,α}$ and uniformly convex, we obtain sharp pointwise two-sided asymptotics at interior points with explicit leading constants. Finally, in dimensions $n\ge 3$ we establish a stability phenomenon: if the pointwise estimate is nearly saturated, then the measure discrepancy must concentrate near the point at the natural scale, quantifying rigidity of almost-extremal configurations.

*Tianling Jin,Xushan Tu,Jingang Xiong*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Sharp global distance estimates for convex functions to unimodular quadratic polynomials based on Monge-Ampère defect measure variation, with explicit optimal constants and asymptotic rigidity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop sharp Alexandrov estimates in measure-theoretic settings where standard subsolution methods fail to yield optimal constants, extending previous work on sharp Alexandrov estimates.

Method: Uses sharp Alexandrov estimates from earlier work to obtain global uniform distance estimates from convex functions to unimodular convex quadratic polynomials in terms of total variation of Monge-Ampère defect measure relative to Lebesgue measure.

Result: Obtains explicit optimal constant for the inequality, proves asymptotic rigidity at infinity with unique quadratic asymptote and explicit convergence rate, and establishes sharp affine invariant global Alexandrov estimate with equality characterization.

Conclusion: Provides quantitative mass-separation condition ensuring strict convexity and smoothness for entire solutions of Monge-Ampère equations with multiple isolated singularities, demonstrating practical applications of the sharp estimates.

Abstract: This paper continues our work [19] on sharp Alexandrov estimates. We obtain a sharp global uniform distance estimate from a convex function to the class of unimodular convex quadratic polynomials in terms of the total variation of its Monge-Ampère defect measure relative to Lebesgue measure. The estimate has an explicit optimal constant, and the inequality is strict in the regime of positive finite defect mass. In this regime we further prove asymptotic rigidity at infinity: every such convex function admits a unique quadratic asymptote with an explicit convergence rate, and satisfies a sharp affine invariant global Alexandrov estimate with equality if and only if the function solves the isolated singularity problem or the hyperplane obstacle problem. Standard subsolution methods are not well suited to this measure-theoretic setting and typically do not yield sharp constants, while the sharp Alexandrov estimates developed in our earlier work [19] play a central role here.
  As an application, for entire solutions of Monge-Ampère equations with multiple (possibly infinitely many) isolated singularities, we give an explicit quantitative mass-separation condition ensuring strict convexity and hence smoothness away from the set of the isolated singularities.

*Huyuan Chen,Rui Chen,Daniel Hauer*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces the fractional-logarithmic Laplacian operator, studies its properties, functional framework, and applications to eigenvalue problems with Weyl asymptotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To define and study a new singular integral operator that interpolates between the fractional Laplacian and logarithmic Laplacian, capturing both fractional and logarithmic scaling behaviors.

Method: Define the fractional-logarithmic Laplacian as derivative of fractional Laplacian, prove multiple equivalent representations, develop functional analysis framework on ℝⁿ and bounded domains, study Poisson and eigenvalue problems.

Result: Established integral representation, compact embedding at critical exponent, existence/regularity for Poisson problem, spectral properties, and Weyl-type asymptotics with logarithmic growth factor.

Conclusion: The fractional-logarithmic Laplacian provides a new operator with interesting mathematical properties that bridges fractional and logarithmic scaling, with applications to PDEs and spectral theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the fractional--logarithmic Laplacian \( (-Δ)^{s+\log} \), defined as the derivative of the fractional Laplacian \( (-Δ)^t \) at \( t=s \). It is a singular integral operator with Fourier symbol \( |ξ|^{2s}(2\ln|ξ|) \), and we prove the pointwise integral representation \[ (-Δ)^{s+\log}u(x) = c_{n,s}\,\mathrm{PV}\!\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}\bigl(-2\ln|x-y|\bigr)\,dy + b_{n,s}(-Δ)^s u(x), \] where \( c_{n,s} \) is the normalization constant of the fractional Laplacian and \( b_{n,s}:=\frac{d}{ds}c_{n,s}.\) We also establish several equivalent formulations of \( (-Δ)^{s+\log} \), including the singular-integral representation, the Fourier-multiplier representation, the spectral-calculus definition, and an extension characterization.
  We develop the associated functional framework on both \( \mathbb{R}^n \) and bounded Lipschitz domains, introducing the natural energy spaces and proving embedding results. In particular, we obtain a compact embedding at the critical exponent \( 2_s^*=\frac{2n}{n-2s},\) a phenomenon that differs from the classical Sobolev and fractional Sobolev settings. We further study the Poisson problem, proving existence and \( L^\infty \)-regularity results. We then investigate the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and establish qualitative spectral properties. Finally, we derive a Weyl-type asymptotic law for the eigenvalue counting function and for the \( k \)-th Dirichlet eigenvalue, showing that the high-frequency behavior combines the fractional Weyl scaling with a logarithmic growth factor, thereby interpolating between the fractional Laplacian and the logarithmic Laplacian.

Motivation: To understand fine pointwise behavior of energy densities for harmonic functions on fractals, which has been less studied despite extensive research on energy measures in fractal analysis.

Method: Investigate regularity properties of energy densities associated with harmonic functions on Sierpinski gasket with respect to Kusuoka measure.

Result: Proved that density of energy measure of nonconstant harmonic function is almost everywhere discontinuous, but Hölder continuous when restricted to each one-dimensional edge of the gasket.

Conclusion: Energy densities exhibit mixed regularity: globally discontinuous but locally regular on edges, revealing complex behavior of harmonic functions on fractals.

Abstract: We investigate the regularity properties of energy densities associated with harmonic functions on the Sierpinski gasket with respect to the Kusuoka measure. While energy measures themselves have been extensively studied in the framework of analysis on fractals, the fine pointwise behavior of their densities has remained less well understood. We prove that the density of the energy measure of a nonconstant harmonic function is almost everywhere discontinuous, whereas it is Hölder continuous when restricted to each one-dimensional edge of the gasket.

TL;DR: Sharp Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius, derived via reduction to small-volume functions and connection to isoperimetric profile expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish sharp Sobolev inequalities on complete Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius, extending classical Euclidean Sobolev inequalities to non-compact Riemannian settings with curvature constraints.

Method: 1. Reduce inequality to functions with small support volume. 2. Show small-volume inequality follows from first-order uniform asymptotic expansion of isoperimetric profile. 3. Prove expansion follows from local uniform Sobolev inequality for W^{1,1} functions with small-diameter support.

Result: Derives sharp Sobolev inequality for embedding W^{1,p}(M) into L^{np/(n-p)}(M) for 1 ≤ p < n on manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius.

Conclusion: Sharp Sobolev inequalities on such manifolds can be established by connecting them to isoperimetric profile expansions, which in turn follow from local Sobolev inequalities for functions with small support.

Abstract: Given a smooth, complete Riemannian manifold $M$ with bounded Ricci curvature and positive injectivity radius, we derive a sharp Sobolev inequality for the embedding of $W^{1,p}(M)$ into $L^{\frac{np}{n-p}}(M)$, when $1\le p< n$. We will first reduce the inequality to functions having support with small enough volume. In turn, we will show that the inequality for small volumes is implied by a first order uniform asymptotic expansion of the isoperimetric profile for $M$, for small volumes. We will then show that such an expansion follows from a local, uniform Sobolev inequality for functions in $W^{1,1}$, having support with small enough diameter.

TL;DR: Existence of nonconstant radially symmetric stationary solutions with sharp internal interfaces in mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems on N-dimensional balls, with rigorous asymptotic approximations and error estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCRD systems model phase separation and pattern formation in biological contexts (cell polarity, biomolecular condensates) and ecological systems. While numerical simulations suggest stationary patterns with sharp interfaces exist, rigorous mathematical proof was needed.

Method: Developed a refined matched-asymptotic framework that directly incorporates the global mass constraint, complemented by uniform spectral/linear analysis. This approach works for general spatial dimension N and a general class of bistable MCRD systems.

Result: Proved existence of nonconstant radially symmetric stationary solutions with single internal transition layers on N-dimensional balls. The framework provides arbitrarily high-order asymptotic approximations with quantitative uniform error estimates.

Conclusion: Established rigorous mathematical foundation for transition-layer patterns in MCRD systems, providing quantitative higher-dimensional theory and justification for using these models in biological and ecological pattern formation studies.

Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion (MCRD) systems are widely used to model phase separation and pattern formation in cell polarity, biomolecular condensates, and ecological systems. Numerical simulations and formal asymptotic analysis suggest that such models can support stationary patterns with sharp internal interfaces. In this work, we establish for a general class of bistable MCRD systems the existence of nonconstant radially symmetric stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer on an $N$-dimensional ball, for general spatial dimension $N$. Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis. Beyond mere existence, our framework yields arbitrarily high-order asymptotic approximations of the constructed solutions together with quantitative uniform error estimates, which provides a quantitative higher-dimensional theory of transition-layer patterns in MCRD systems and a rigorous justification for their use in modeling phase separation and pattern formation in biological and ecological settings.

*Quentin Griette,Franco Herrera*

Main category: math.AP

TL;DR: Existence of sharp threshold dynamics in Gurtin-MacCamy population model with bistable birth function, distinguishing extinction vs. persistence based on initial population parameter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand long-term population dynamics in age-structured models with bistable birth functions, particularly the transition between extinction and persistence behaviors based on initial population distributions.

Method: Uses monotone dynamical systems theory to analyze one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions. For compactly supported birth rates, proves existence of unique threshold parameter. For non-compactly supported cases, translates age-structured model into integro-differential system.

Result: Proves existence of sharp transition between extinction and persistence dynamics. Shows exactly one threshold value exists when birth rate has compact support. Approach also effective for handling particular non-compactly supported birth rates.

Conclusion: The Gurtin-MacCamy model with bistable birth function exhibits sharp threshold dynamics. Monotone dynamical systems theory effectively captures transition behavior, even extending to certain non-compactly supported birth rate cases through integro-differential system translation.

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the long-term dynamics of solutions to the Gurtin-MacCamy population model with a bistable birth function. We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system.

TL;DR: Global existence of strong solutions for pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system without smallness assumption on initial density, only requiring boundedness and finite total mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies required small initial data with high regularity for global existence. This work aims to relax these restrictive assumptions to only require bounded initial density with finite total mass.

Method: Elementary energy method without sophisticated Fourier analysis tools, obtaining optimal decay estimates for energy and dissipation functionals.

Result: Global existence of strong solutions in whole space without small initial density assumption, optimal decay estimates, and long-time description of density.

Conclusion: The pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system admits global strong solutions under minimal assumptions (bounded density with finite mass), using simple energy methods rather than complex Fourier analysis.

Abstract: The pressureless Euler-Navier-Stokes system can be obtained formally from the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system, under the assumption that the distribution function describing the density of particles is monokinetic. Its study has been the subject of several recent papers, which have established the global existence of solutions with high enough regularity, for small initial data. In this work, we demonstrate the global existence of strong solutions in the whole space case, without assuming the initial density to be small and regular: it suffices for it to be bounded and for the total mass to be finite. In passing, we obtain optimal decay estimates for the energy and dissipation functionals. As a corollary, we get a long-time description of the density. All these results are based on an elementary energy method, with no need of sophisticated Fourier analysis tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously analyze the PDE heuristically derived by Steinerberg on the real line, which describes how the density of polynomial roots evolves under differentiation, extending this study to the circle.

Method: Integrate the PDE and apply viscosity solutions theory to handle the singular nonlinear parabolic integro-differential equation involving the half-Laplacian, restricting to strictly positive initial conditions due to singularity.

Result: Obtain a comparison principle for solutions of the primitive equation, yielding uniqueness, existence, and continuity with respect to initial conditions. Provide heuristics showing that the particle system approximates the equation solution.

Conclusion: The study successfully applies viscosity solutions theory to analyze the singular PDE describing root density evolution under differentiation on the circle, establishing key analytical properties and connecting particle systems to the continuum equation.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the partial differential equation on the circle that was heuristically obtained by Steinerberg [32] on the real line and which represents the evolution of the density of the roots of polynomials under differentiation. After integrating the partial differential equation in question, we observe that it can be treated with the theory of viscosity solutions. This equation at hand is a non linear parabolic integro-differential equation which involves the elliptic operator called the half-Laplacian. Due to the singularity of the equation, we restrict our study to strictly positive initial condition. We obtain a comparison principle for solutions of the primitive equation which yields uniqueness, existence, continuity with respect to initial condition. We also present heuristics to justify that the system of particles indeed approximates the solution of the equation.

Motivation: To develop a robust particle method for the porous medium equation that preserves key continuum properties and ensures convergence for general initial data.

Method: Nearest neighbor Lagrangian particle discretization of the one-dimensional porous medium equation, with proof of discrete Aronson-Bénilan estimate.

Result: The particle model satisfies discrete Aronson-Bénilan estimate, uniform support growth and L∞ decay estimates, and converges to continuum solution for L¹ initial data.

Conclusion: The Lagrangian particle scheme provides a convergent numerical method for the porous medium equation that preserves fundamental analytical properties of the continuum model.

Abstract: We consider a nearest neighbor, Lagrangian particle discretization of the one dimensional porous medium equation. We prove that the particle model satisfies a discrete analog of the celebrated Aronson-Bénilan estimate, which we use to prove a growth estimate for the evolution of the support and an $L^\infty$ decay estimate which are both known to hold in the continuum. These estimates are uniform with respect to the number of particles. We also prove convergence of the scheme towards the solution to the porous medium equation in the full generality of $L^1$ initial data.

TL;DR: Global stability result for homogeneous, incompressible MHD equations on any dimensional torus with explicit decay estimates via high-order Sobolev norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish global stability results for MHD equations similar to those known for Navier-Stokes equations, leveraging structural analogies between the two systems.

Method: Uses a suitable formulation of MHD equations emphasizing structural similarities with NS equations, employs general theory of approximate solutions for MHD Cauchy problem, and introduces Beltrami-type initial data that produce decaying solutions.

Result: Proves global stability for MHD equations with positive viscosity and resistivity on any dimensional torus, with fully explicit decay estimates via arbitrarily high-order Sobolev norms, and shows existence of large Beltrami-type initial data producing global decaying solutions.

Conclusion: The MHD equations exhibit global stability properties analogous to Navier-Stokes equations, with explicit decay estimates and existence of special initial data producing decaying solutions, demonstrating strong structural similarities between the two systems.

Abstract: We propose a result of global stability for the equations of homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a torus of any dimension $d \in \{2,3,...\}$, with positive viscosity and resistivity. This result applies to the $C^\infty$ global solutions, with a conveniently defined decay property for large times; it is expressed by fully explicit estimates, formulated via $H^p$-type Sobolev norms of arbitrarily high order $p$. The present stability result is similar to that proposed by one of us for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation \cite{glosta}; it is derived from a suitable formulation of the MHD equations proposed in our previous work \cite{MHD}, emphasizing strong structural analogies with the NS case. A basic tool in the proof of the present stability result is a general theory of approximate solutions of the MHD Cauchy problem, that we developed in \cite{MHD} on the grounds of previous results on the NS equation \cite{smooth} and of the above structural similarities. We also introduce a class of Beltrami-type initial data for the MHD equations; although being arbitrarily large, these data produce global and decaying MHD solutions, fitting the framework of the present stability result. Comparisons with the previous literature on these subjects are performed.

Result: Annular targets achieved 49% laser energy absorption (vs 16% for flat), peak electron temperature of 5.1 MeV (vs 2.2 MeV), proton cut-off energy of 22 MeV (vs 12 MeV), and Carbon ion energies beyond 60 MeV.

Conclusion: Tailoring target curvature to exploit optical trapping and geometric focusing offers a robust pathway for developing compact, high-efficiency laser-ion sources.

Abstract: Enhancing the conversion efficiency and maximum energy of laser-driven ion beams is a critical challenge for applications in hadron therapy and high-energy density physics. In this work, we present a comprehensive two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation study comparing Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) from standard flat foils and novel annular sector (C-shaped) targets. Under identical ultra-intense laser irradiation (a0=10, tau=25 fs), the annular sector geometry demonstrates a substantial enhancement in acceleration performance driven by two synergistic mechanisms: electromagnetic cavity confinement and geometric plasma focusing. Our analysis reveals that the target void acts as an optical trap, sustaining oscillating electromagnetic fields for over 300fs via multiple internal reflections. This confinement results in a total laser energy absorption of 49% (compared to 16% for flat targets), which yields a peak electron temperature of 5.1 MeV more than double the 2.2MeV observed in flat targets. Furthermore, phase space diagnostics confirm that ion bunches accelerated from the converging cavity walls superimpose at the geometric center, creating a localized high-density focal spot. Consequently, the annular target increases the proton cut-off energy to 22MeV (vs. 12MeV for flat targets) and boosts Carbon ion energies beyond 60MeV. These findings establish that tailoring target curvature to exploit optical trapping and geometric focusing offers a robust pathway for developing compact, high-efficiency laser-ion sources.

TL;DR: PIC simulations show rarefaction waves in vacuum don't form shocks due to no density maximum, while in ambient plasma they create hot ion pistons that enable reverse shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how circular rarefaction waves behave when expanding into vacuum versus ambient plasma, particularly whether they form shocks or instabilities during interaction.

Method: Used 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to resolve the expansion of two circular rarefaction waves in both vacuum and thin ambient plasma conditions.

Result: In vacuum: rarefaction waves interpenetrate without density maximum, leading to ion-ion instabilities instead of shocks. In ambient plasma: waves pile up ambient ions forming hot ion pistons that enable reverse shocks to grow and eventually collapse.

Conclusion: The presence of ambient plasma fundamentally changes rarefaction wave interaction dynamics, enabling shock formation through hot ion piston creation, unlike vacuum conditions where only instabilities occur.

Abstract: The expansion of two circular rarefaction waves in vacuum or in a thin ambient plasma is examined with particle-in-cell simulations that resolve two spatial dimensions. In the simulation with no ambient plasma, the rarefaction waves interpenetrate near the symmetry line between both rarefaction wave centers. The exponential density decrease of rarefaction waves with distance implies that the sum of their density does not lead to a density maximum near the symmetry line. The absence of a density maximum, which would yield a repelling electric potential for the inflowing rarefaction wave ions near the symmetry line, and the high interpenetration speed of the ion beams lead to ion-ion instabilities rather than shocks in the overlap layer. The simulations with ambient plasma show that the rarefaction waves pile up the ions of the ambient plasma near the symmetry line. A localized piston of hot ambient ions forms. If its density is large enough, its thermoelectric field allows reverse shocks to grow in the rarefaction waves. These reverse shocks move slowly in the simulation frame and enclose a slab of downstream plasma. A decrease in the speed of the rarefaction wave ions upstream of the shocks with time leads to their collapse.

TL;DR: Inviscid vortex sheet model with continuous leading-edge shedding is compared to Navier-Stokes simulations for unsteady plate motions at Re≈1000. Model works well in body-dominated regimes but shows reduced agreement in flow-dominated regimes with vortex shedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the regimes where inviscid vortex sheet models can reliably predict forces and provide physical interpretation for unsteady plate motions, by comparing with direct Navier-Stokes simulations across diverse kinematic configurations.

Method: Compare inviscid vortex sheet model with continuous leading-edge shedding against direct Navier-Stokes simulations for ~70 distinct kinematic configurations at Re≈1000, spanning body-dominated and flow-dominated regimes.

Result: In body-dominated motions (plate acceleration-driven), the inviscid model accurately reproduces normal force histories and vorticity field structure. In flow-dominated regimes (with vortex shedding), force prediction agreement is good but reduced at low angles of attack due to sensitivity of vortex shedding dynamics.

Conclusion: The formulation's ability to accommodate stable, continuous leading-edge vortex shedding enables uniform comparisons across diverse motions and clarifies regimes where inviscid vortex sheet models can be reliably used for force prediction and physical interpretation.

Abstract: We compare an inviscid vortex sheet model with continuous leading-edge shedding with direct Navier-Stokes simulations over a wide range of unsteady plate motions at moderate Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \approx 1000$). Approximately $70$ distinct kinematic configurations are examined, spanning both body-dominated and flow-dominated regimes. In body-dominated motions, where the fluid dynamics are primarily driven by prescribed plate accelerations, the inviscid model accurately reproduces normal force histories and the qualitative structure of the induced vorticity field. In flow-dominated configurations, with quasi-periodic vortex shedding, agreement with force predictions is good but reduced at low angles of attack, reflecting the greater sensitivity of vortex shedding dynamics to physical and computational parameters. The ability of the present formulation to accommodate stable, continuous leading-edge vortex shedding enables uniform comparisons across diverse motions and clarifies the regimes in which inviscid vortex sheet models can be used reliably for force prediction and physical interpretation.

TL;DR: Asymptotic model for non-equatorial wind-generated ocean currents derived from rotating spherical Navier-Stokes equations without tangent-plane approximations, capturing large-scale flows through double asymptotic expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate model for wind-generated oceanic drift currents that avoids the limitations of classical f-plane approximations, allowing for large-scale flows while maintaining physical realism with depth-varying eddy viscosity.

Method: Derivation from rotating spherical Navier-Stokes equations with constant density and depth-varying eddy viscosity, using double asymptotic expansion with respect to two small parameters: Ekman layer depth to Earth radius ratio and Rossby number.

Result: Established existence/uniqueness of leading-order solution showing Ekman spiral behavior for any viscosity profile, derived first-order correction equations with a priori bounds, and computed surface deflection angles for various viscosity profiles that match observations.

Conclusion: The asymptotic model successfully captures wind-driven ocean currents without tangent-plane approximations, produces physically realistic Ekman spirals, and yields surface deflection angles consistent with observational data across different viscosity profiles.

Abstract: Starting from the Navier--Stokes equations in rotating spherical coordinates with constant density and eddy viscosity varying only with depth, and appropriate, physically motivated boundary conditions, we derive an asymptotic model for the description of non-equatorial wind-generated oceanic drift currents. We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations.

Abstract: Radio observations provide powerful diagnostics of energy release, particle acceleration, and transport processes in solar flares. However, despite recent progress in radio interferometric imaging spectroscopy, current instruments still face limitations in image fidelity and resolution, restricting detailed spectroscopic studies of flaring regions. Here we present high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy of a M1.3 GOES class flare with MeerKAT, a precursor to the future-generation array SKA-Mid. Radio emissions at the observed frequencies typically originate in the low corona, offering valuable insights into magnetic reconnection and primary energy-release sites. The obtained images achieve an unprecedented dynamic range exceeding 10^3, enabling simultaneous analysis of bright coherent bursts and faint incoherent emission from the active region. Multiple spatially distinct coherent sources are identified, implying contributions from different populations of accelerated electrons. The incoherent emission extends beyond AIA structures, highlighting MeerKAT's ability to detect dilute but hot plasma invisible to Extreme Ultraviolet instruments. Combined with co-temporal Hard X-ray images and magnetic field extrapolations, the radio sources are located within distinct magnetic structures, further revealing their association with different populations of accelerated electrons. These results demonstrate MeerKAT imaging spectroscopy as powerful diagnostics of solar flares and pave the way for future solar flare studies with SKA-Mid.

### [32] [Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696)
*Gregorio Falqui,Tamara Grava,Christian Puntini*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper extends the concept of soliton gas to breather gas for the Focusing Nonlinear Schrödinger equation, showing that a deterministic gas of breathers can exhibit shielding effects similar to soliton gases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the concept of soliton gas to breather gas and investigate whether breather gases can exhibit similar collective behaviors and shielding effects as observed in soliton gases.

Method: Construct a deterministic gas of breathers by taking the limit N→∞ of an N-breather solution. The limit is performed at the scattering data level by letting the breather spectrum fill a compact domain uniformly, with norming constants interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as 1/N.

Result: For particular choices of the domain and interpolating function, the breather gas behaves as a finite breather solution, demonstrating that the shielding effect discovered for soliton gases also extends to breather gases.

Conclusion: The shielding effect observed in soliton gases is not limited to solitons but also applies to breather gases, extending the understanding of collective behaviors in nonlinear wave systems.

Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.

### [33] [Single- and Multi-Level Fourier-RQMC Methods for Multivariate Shortfall Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06424)
*Chiheb Ben Hammouda,Truong Ngoc Nguyen*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: New Fourier RQMC methods for efficient computation of multivariate shortfall risk measures and optimal allocations, outperforming existing Monte Carlo approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate shortfall risk measures are important for systemic risk quantification but computationally challenging due to slow convergence of existing Monte Carlo methods.

Method: Combines Fourier inversion techniques with randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling, operating in frequency domain where integrands are smoother, plus multilevel RQMC scheme.

Result: Proposed methods outperform sample average approximation and stochastic optimization benchmarks in accuracy and computational cost across various models.

Conclusion: Fourier RQMC methods provide improved asymptotic convergence and complexity rates for multivariate shortfall risk estimation, with additional savings from multilevel construction.

Abstract: Multivariate shortfall risk measures provide a principled framework for quantifying systemic risk and determining capital allocations prior to aggregation in interconnected financial systems. Despite their well established theoretical properties, the numerical estimation of multivariate shortfall risk and the corresponding optimal allocations remains computationally challenging, as existing Monte Carlo based approaches can be numerically expensive due to slow convergence.
  In this work, we develop a new class of single and multilevel numerical algorithms for estimating multivariate shortfall risk and the associated optimal allocations, based on a combination of Fourier inversion techniques and randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. Rather than operating in physical space, our approach evaluates the relevant expectations appearing in the risk constraint and its optimization in the frequency domain, where the integrands exhibit enhanced smoothness properties that are well suited for RQMC integration. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework for the resulting Fourier RQMC estimators, including convergence analysis and computational complexity bounds. Beyond the single level method, we introduce a multilevel RQMC scheme that exploits the geometric convergence of the underlying deterministic optimization algorithm to reduce computational cost while preserving accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed Fourier RQMC methods outperform sample average approximation and stochastic optimization benchmarks in terms of accuracy and computational cost across a range of models for the risk factors and loss structures. Consistent with the theoretical analysis, these results demonstrate improved asymptotic convergence and complexity rates relative to the benchmark methods, with additional savings achieved through the proposed multilevel RQMC construction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address McKean-Vlasov SDEs with challenging growth conditions where drift coefficients grow super-linearly in both state variables and measure arguments, and diffusion coefficients exhibit super-linear growth in state variables.

Method: Construct an Euler-like sequence to establish strong well-posedness under locally monotone conditions, then study propagation of chaos for interacting particle systems converging to non-interacting systems.

Conclusion: The paper successfully handles MVSDEs with super-linear growth conditions through constructive methods, establishes convergence properties, and validates theoretical results with practical examples and simulations.

Abstract: This paper studies McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) whose drift coefficients grow super-linearly in both state variables and measure arguments, and whose diffusion coefficients exhibit super-linear growth in the state variables. By constructing an Euler-like sequence, we establish the strong well-posedness of such MVSDEs under a locally monotone condition. Furthermore, the propagation of chaos is studied on both finite and infinite horizons, demonstrating convergence of the interacting particle system to the corresponding non-interacting system. To illustrate the rationality of the theoretical results, we provide examples whose drifts contain the high powers and multiple integrals of distributions, with numerical simulations presented in Section 6.

*E. Elson*

TL;DR: Simple single-hidden-layer neural network trained on synthetic galaxies accurately predicts stellar masses from photometry alone, achieving ~0.131 dex scatter across 3.5 dex mass range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not necessary for robust stellar mass estimation, and that lightweight machine-learning models trained on simulations can effectively transfer to real observations.

Method: Used a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with single hidden layer trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies from SHARK semi-analytic model. Input features: absolute magnitudes and colour indices. Applied to GAMA survey galaxies.

Result: Network accurately predicts stellar masses across nearly 3.5 dex range with ~0.131 dex scatter. Successfully applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated to provide error estimates.

Conclusion: Establishes computationally efficient and transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies, showing simple models can capture dominant physical information in broad-band photometry.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that the stellar masses of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, originally derived via stellar population synthesis modelling, can be accurately predicted using only their absolute magnitudes and colour indices. A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies.

### [36] [Chaotic Dynamics of Conformable Semigroups via Classical Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06782)
*Mohamed Khoulane,Aziz El Ghazouani,M'hamed Elomari*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: Conformable derivatives don't create genuinely new semigroup theory - they're equivalent to classical semigroups observed through a nonlinear time change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether conformable time evolution creates genuinely new dynamical systems or can be reduced to classical theory through time reparametrization.

Method: Introduce conformable clock Ψ(t)=t^δ/δ, prove every C_0-δ-semigroup can be represented as classical semigroup under this time change, analyze in conformable Lebesgue spaces L^{p,δ} shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard L^p spaces.

Result: Conformable semigroups exactly correspond to classical semigroups under nonlinear time change, δ-generator equals classical generator on common domain, orbit sets unchanged, dynamical properties invariant under conformable clock.

Conclusion: Conformable derivatives don't create new dynamical features - they're equivalent to classical dynamics observed through nonlinear time scaling, clarifying which properties are intrinsic vs. artifacts of time reparametrization.

Abstract: Conformable derivatives involve a fractional parameter while preserving locality: on smooth functions they reduce to a classical derivative multiplied by an explicit weight. Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $δ\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \[ Ψ(t)=\frac{t^δ}δ, \] and prove that every $C_0$--$δ$--semigroup $\mathcal S_δ$ admits the representation \[ \mathcal S_δ(t)=\mathcal T(Ψ(t)), \] where $\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $δ$--generator of $\mathcal S_δ$ coincides with the generator of $\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=Ψ(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $δ$--hypercyclicity and $δ$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,δ}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time.
