We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Existence of sharp threshold dynamics in Gurtin-MacCamy population model with bistable birth function, distinguishing extinction vs. persistence based on initial population parameter.", "motivation": "To understand long-term population dynamics in age-structured models with bistable birth functions, particularly the transition between extinction and persistence behaviors based on initial population distributions.", "method": "Uses monotone dynamical systems theory to analyze one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions.

The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution.

Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory.

In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $\u03b4$--hypercyclicity and $\u03b4$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result.
