By employing spectral analysis techniques and establishing uniform resolvent estimates, we derive uniform polynomial decay rates for the associated semigroups under a suitable class of boundary conditions. Particular attention is paid to the role of modal approximations in energy analysis. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments that illustrate how the regularity of initial data, smooth versus nonsmooth, affects the observed decay rates, providing deeper insight into the interplay between spectral structure and energy dissipation."}

In a nutshell, the algorithms iteratively compute a basis matrix, in one of the two particular forms, for the eigenspace of some matrix pencil associated with its eigenvalues in certain complex region such as the left-half plane or the open unit disk, and their success critically depends on that the interested eigenspace do have a basis matrix taking one of the two particular forms. However, that requirement in general cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a new doubling algorithm, called the $Q$-doubling algorithm, is proposed. It includes the existing doubling algorithms as special cases and does not require that the basis matrix takes one of the particular forms. An application of the $Q$-doubling algorithm to solve eigenvalue problems is investigated with numerical experiments that demonstrate its superior robustness to the existing doubling algorithms."}

We implement a greedy approach for this problem, whose computational efficiency we improve using rank-one updates via the Sherman-Morrison formula. We additionally present an iterative algorithm that, for each feasible allocation of sensors, greedily optimizes over each sensor fidelity subject to previous sensor choices, repeating this process until a termination criterion is satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, these algorithms are novel in the context of cost constrained multifidelity sensor placement. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark state estimation problems, including reconstructions of sea surface temperature and flow around a cylinder, and empirically demonstrate improved performance over random designs."}

We introduce a space-time regularization framework that couples spatial regularization with a learned temporal Fields-of-Experts (FoE) prior to capture complex spatiotemporal activation patterns. We derive a finite element discretization on unstructured cardiac surface meshes, prove Mosco-convergence, and develop a scalable optimization algorithm capable of handling the FoE term.

The modeling of LTPs and interpretation of LTP experiments rely heavily on accurate data, much of which is hosted on LXCat, a community-driven, open-access platform central to the LTP research ecosystem. To investigate the scholarly impact of the LXCat platform over the past decade, we analyzed a curated corpus of full-text research articles citing three foundational LXCat publications.

It is well known that the normalized tangent plane method is able to simultaneously achieve the non-convex manifold constraint and original energy dissipation. However, the associated computational cost of this numerical approach is exceedingly high. By contrast, the projection method is more straightforward to implement, while it often compromises the inherent energy dissipative property of the continuous model, and the error analysis turns out to be even more challenging. In this work, we first construct a linear and fully discrete finite difference numerical scheme, based on the projection method for the LLG equation, which is capable of simultaneously preserving the non-convex manifold constraint \\(|\\mathbf{m}| = 1\\) and an unconditional original energy dissipation. In the error analysis, the classical theoretical technique becomes ineffective, due to the presence of the nonlinear Laplacian term, which in turn poses a significant challenge. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we carefully rewrite the numerical method in an equivalent weak form, in which a point-wise length preserving feature of the numerical solution plays an essential role. As a result of these estimates in the reformulated weak form, an optimal convergence rate could be theoretically established. In our knowledge, this numerical method is the first linear algorithm that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (i) point-wise length preservation, (ii) unconditional original energy dissipation, (iii) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate."}

The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P < 0.1$ and OSI $\\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms.

Experimentally, the height of the XPR can be controlled by adjusting the seeding rate and heating power. This contribution presents axisymmetric (2D) simulations of the XPR regime in ASDEX Upgrade using the nonlinear MHD code JOREK extended with a kinetic particle framework for the main species neutrals and nitrogen impurities. With the time-dependent simulations, the progression from attached divertors to a complete detachment with the XPR formation is shown, highlighting the effects of the neutrals and impurities separately. Amidst this progression, the formation and the loss of the high-field-side high-density are observed. After the XPR is well-formed at the height of 6.8 cm, the fuelling and seeding rates are adjusted so that the XPR remains stationary. From the stationary case, the seeding rate is then changed to see how the XPR location reacts.

To mitigate numerical dispersion and reduce pollution error, we employ fourth- and sixth-order compact finite-difference schemes, thereby significantly softening the strict points-per-wavelength requirement. The resulting large, ill-conditioned linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES method. The key innovation lies in the construction of the preconditioner: we introduce two highly efficient direct solvers - one based on a low-dimensional eigenvector transformation (EigT) and another on a partial Fast Fourier Transform (PFFT) algorithm - both derived from a lower-order approximation of the original problem that incorporates the absorbing boundary conditions. The motivation and efficacy of this lower-order preconditioning strategy for high-resolution schemes are analyzed through model problems, providing insight into the convergence rate. The theoretical analysis is validated by a comprehensive set of numerical experiments, demonstrating the method's performance for realistic problem sizes and parameters."}

In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites. The model consists in a mathematical description of the mechanisms in which different types of cells interact, synthesize and degrade extra-cellular matrices under the influence of biochemical factors. Special attention is given to angiogenesis, oxygen-dependent effects and growth factor-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts. Furthermore, considering the depth-dependent vascularization of mandibular bone and its influence on bone healing, a functional description of the cell distribution on the severed periodontal ligament (PDL) is proposed. The developed model was implemented using the finite element method (FEM) and successfully validated by simulating an animal in-vivo experiment on dogs reported in the literature. A good fit between model outcome and experimental data was obtained with a mean absolute error of 3.04%.

Although classical analytical models such as the Child-Langmuir (CL) sheath model provide clear predictions for sheath thickness, experimental validation has been limited because most diagnostics either rely on indirect, multi-step inference (e.g., Langmuir probes) or require invasive and technically demanding techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that the plasma impedance probe (PIP), when operated with a controlled DC bias, enables relatively direct, model-informed measurements of sheath thickness that are reasonably straightforward to implement experimentally. Across a range of discharge conditions, biased-PIP sheath thickness measurements are found to follow CL scaling closely, requiring a single, consistent empirical correction factor of $α\\approx 0.74$ to reconcile the measured thickness with CL predictions. Concurrent measurements of plasma density and electron damping show that probe biasing does not significantly perturb the bulk plasma density, supporting the validity of the biased-PIP approach. Building on this validation, we leverage the empirically determined $α$ factor to extend the floating (unbiased) PIP analysis to obtain model-dependent estimates of electron temperature and plasma potential without electrical biasing. A side-by-side comparison demonstrates close agreement between floating-PIP results and those obtained from a biased Langmuir probe. Taken together, these results establish the PIP as a complementary diagnostic to the Langmuir probe, expanding the range of accessible plasma measurements while providing experimental support for classical sheath models."}

In this study, the hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code is used to investigate the effects of reversed magnetic shear on internal kink and fishbone mode in a circular shaped limiter tokamak. In the absence of energetic particles (EPs), the mode growth rate initially increases and then decreases as the magnetic shear changes from positive to negative, indicating stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear on the internal kink mode. In the presence of EPs, when the reversed magnetic shear region is sufficiently narrow, the transition from internal kink/fishbone modes to double kink/fishbone modes takes place, and the stabilizing effects of the reversed magnetic shear can significantly dominate the destabilization of EPs. For non-resonant modes, the EP beta fraction $β_f$ for excitation increases with $q_{min}$, concurrent with progressively lower growth rates in non-resonant fishbone modes. When the equilibrium profile has an internal transport barrier (ITB), broader ITB widths suppress internal kink modes more effectively, whereas steeper temperature gradients strengthen EP stabilization."}

In this work, we report a data-driven discovery that motivates a reinterpretation of this classical view. We consider the linear convection equation discretized using an unstable FTCS scheme augmented with a learnable artificial viscosity. Using automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, the viscosity field is inferred by minimizing the error with respect to the exact solution, without imposing any sign constraints. The optimized viscosity consistently becomes locally negative near extrema, while the numerical solution remains stable and nearly exact. This behavior is not readily explained within classical modified equation analysis and Lax-Wendroff-type arguments, which predict a strictly positive effective viscosity. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reinterpret artificial viscosity as a space-time closure that compensates unresolved truncation errors while enforcing entropy stability through global dissipation balance rather than pointwise positivity. Within this framework, the Lax-Wendroff scheme corresponds to a degenerate projection in which temporal truncation errors are eliminated and reintroduced as spatial diffusion. We show that entropy stability constrains the integrated dissipation budget rather than the pointwise sign of spatial viscosity. As a result, locally negative viscosity naturally emerges as a numerical reconvolution operator that compensates for dispersive truncation errors. Negative viscosity is therefore not an unphysical diffusion process, but a scheme- and grid-dependent correction mechanism."}

While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause)."}

Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism."}

The solution process is driven by the deep energy method, while finite element solutions can be obtained in parallel. The framework supports built-in problems including Poisson, screened Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity in two and three dimensions, as well as user-defined energy functionals analogous to the \\texttt{UMAT} interface in Abaqus. The source code is available at https://github.com/yizheng-wang/LMDEM, and a web-based version is accessible at https://ai4m.llmdem.com.

For diatomic gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method commonly employs the Borgnakke-Larsen (BL) model to simulate translational-rotational energy exchange (relaxation) processes. Although widely used, the BL model lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation and assumes that only a fraction of collisions lead to rotational relaxation. To address these shortcomings, Pullin introduced a kinetically consistent relaxation model into the gas kinetic theory. By employing the Beta function for energy partitioning, a concrete collision cross section that satisfies the detailed balance condition is constructed. In this study, a comparative investigation of the BL and Pullin models is performed within the DSMC framework, where both original and simplified equations are considered and parameterized by physical accommodated coefficient in the Beta function. A series of test cases--including zero-dimensional rotational relaxation of nitrogen, one-dimensional planar Couette flow and normal shock wave, two-dimensional hypersonic flow past a cylinder, and three-dimensional hypersonic flow around an X38-like vehicle--are performed to assess the accuracy and efficiency of these models. The results confirm the consistency between the Pullin and BL models. Owing to its rigorous theoretical foundation and accurate physical representation, the Pullin model is expected to provide substantial support for the extension of subsequent theoretical studies and numerical simulations. Moreover, in the highly rarefied flow regime (Knudsen number greater than 1, or altitudes above 100 km), the simplified Pullin model exhibits performance comparable to that of the BL model."}

While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.\n  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR.

While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit.

A key advantage of these models is that they can be trained exclusively on linear elastic data and then generalized to nonlinear inelastic regimes during online prediction. Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance.

We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving \"verification by construction\" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall."}

Quasiperiodic functions are the restriction of higher dimensional periodic functions along a certain (irrational) direction. In classical settings, for real-valued frequencies, this equation is generally not well-posed: existence of solutions in L 2 is not guaranteed and uniqueness in L $\\infty$ may fail. This is a well-known difficulty of Helmholtz equations, but it has never been addressed in the quasiperiodic case. We tackle this issue by using the limiting absorption principle, which consists in adding some imaginary part (also called absorption) to the frequency in order to make the equation well-posed in L 2 , and then defining the physically relevant solution by making the absorption tend to zero. In previous work, we introduced a definition of the solution of the equation with absorption based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary conditions. This approach offers two key advantages: it facilitates the limiting process and has a direct numerical counterpart. In this work, we first explain why the DtN boundary conditions have to be replaced by Robin-to-Robin boundary conditions to make the absorption go to zero. We then prove, under technical assumptions on the frequency, that the limiting absorption principle holds and we propose a numerical method to compute the physical solution."}

This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity.

Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000. Our numerical results show that the StabOp-L-ROM can be orders of magnitude more accurate than the classical L-ROM tuned with an optimal filter radius in the predictive regime. Furthermore, while the new StabOp smooths the input flow fields, its smoothing mechanism differs from that of classical spatial filters."}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that for fused-kernel ABFT implementations that verify before output quantization, low-precision GEMM can use FP32-level thresholds ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-6}$), enabling \\textbf{$\\sim$1000$\\times$ finer detection granularity} compared to offline verification with low-precision output ($e_{\\max} \\approx 10^{-3}$). We reproduce A-ABFT's experimental setup and validate our implementation against the original paper's results. Our method requires only $O(n)$ complexity using max/min/mean statistics, compared to A-ABFT's $O(pn)$ for finding $p$ largest values. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real model weights (LLaMA-7B, GPT-2, ViT) demonstrate V-ABFT's effectiveness across diverse distributions. V-ABFT is platform-agnostic and has been integrated into fault-tolerant GEMM implementations on both NPUs and GPUs."}

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations."}

The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics. Validation studies on synthetic signals, unsteady aerodynamics, the Lorenz '63 system, and a reaction-diffusion model show that TD-TF preserves the interpretability and efficiency of linear models while providing substantially enhanced expressive power for complex dynamics."}
