It is well known that the normalized tangent plane method is able to simultaneously achieve the non-convex manifold constraint and original energy dissipation. However, the associated computational cost of this numerical approach is exceedingly high. By contrast, the projection method is more straightforward to implement, while it often compromises the inherent energy dissipative property of the continuous model, and the error analysis turns out to be even more challenging. In this work, we first construct a linear and fully discrete finite difference numerical scheme, based on the projection method for the LLG equation, which is capable of simultaneously preserving the non-convex manifold constraint \\(|\\mathbf{m}| = 1\\) and an unconditional original energy dissipation. In the error analysis, the classical theoretical technique becomes ineffective, due to the presence of the nonlinear Laplacian term, which in turn poses a significant challenge. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we carefully rewrite the numerical method in an equivalent weak form, in which a point-wise length preserving feature of the numerical solution plays an essential role. As a result of these estimates in the reformulated weak form, an optimal convergence rate could be theoretically established.

In this work, we report a data-driven discovery that motivates a reinterpretation of this classical view. We consider the linear convection equation discretized using an unstable FTCS scheme augmented with a learnable artificial viscosity. Using automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, the viscosity field is inferred by minimizing the error with respect to the exact solution, without imposing any sign constraints. The optimized viscosity consistently becomes locally negative near extrema, while the numerical solution remains stable and nearly exact. This behavior is not readily explained within classical modified equation analysis and Lax-Wendroff-type arguments, which predict a strictly positive effective viscosity. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reinterpret artificial viscosity as a space-time closure that compensates unresolved truncation errors while enforcing entropy stability through global dissipation balance rather than pointwise positivity. Within this framework, the Lax-Wendroff scheme corresponds to a degenerate projection in which temporal truncation errors are eliminated and reintroduced as spatial diffusion. We show that entropy stability constrains the integrated dissipation budget rather than the pointwise sign of spatial viscosity.

Nevertheless, important open questions remain: in under-resolved regimes, which filter is most suitable for a given stabilization or closure model? Moreover, once a filter is selected, how should its parameters, such as the filter radius, be determined? Addressing these questions is essential for the reliable design and performance of filter-based stabilization strategies. To answer these questions, we propose a novel strategy that differs fundamentally from current filter-based approaches: we replace traditional spatial filters with a data-driven stabilization operator (StabOp) that yields accurate results for a given resolution, quantity of interest, and stabilization strategy. Although the new StabOp can be used for both classical discretizations and ROMs, and for different types of filter-based stabilization or closure, for clarity we focus on ROMs and the Leray stabilization. To build the new StabOp, we postulate its model form as a linear, quadratic, or nonlinear mapping, and then solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem to minimize a given loss function. Using the resulting StabOp in the Leray ROM (L-ROM) yields a new stabilized ROM, StabOp-L-ROM. To assess the StabOp-L-ROM, we compare it with the L-ROM and the standard ROM in numerical simulations of four flows: 2D flow past a cylinder at Re=500, lid-driven cavity at Re=10000, 3D flow past a hemisphere at Re=2200, and minimal channel flow at Re=5000.
