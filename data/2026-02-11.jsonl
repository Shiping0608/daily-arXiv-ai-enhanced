The original problem can be confined to the analysis of the fields in one periodic cell. With the help of the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique, we can truncate the unbounded physical domain into a bounded computational domain. By respectively constructing the equivalent transparent boundary conditions of acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the well-posedness and exponential convergence of the solution to the associated truncated PML problem are established. The finite element method is applied to solve the PML problem of acoustic-elastic interaction. To address the singularity caused by the non-smooth surface of the elastic body, we establish a residual-type a posteriori error estimate and develop an adaptive PML finite element algorithm. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive algorithm."}

Moreover, we highlight under which conditions on the mesh velocity the ALE methods, constrained to a given CFL, are actually stable. Next, we extend the stability study to ADER-DG in the presence of degenerate spacetime elements, with zero size at the beginning and the end of the time step, but with a non zero spacetime volume. This kind of elements has been introduced in a series of articles on direct ALE methods by Gaburro et al. to connect via spacetime control volumes regenerated Voronoi tessellations after a topology change. Here, we imitate this behavior in 1d by fictitiously inserting degenerate elements in between two cells.

In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis.

In these devices, strong toroidal rotation and the large mass disparity between protons and boron ions drive complex multi-fluid effects - specifically centrifugal species separation and electrostatic polarization - that standard single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models fail to capture. While comprehensive multi-fluid models are often numerically stiff, we develop a reduced model balancing physical fidelity with computational robustness. By retaining dominant toroidal rotation and self-consistent potential while neglecting poloidal inertia and pressure anisotropy, the model couples a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation with species-specific Bernoulli relations and a quasi-neutrality constraint. The model is applied to two representative p-B ST configurations: the experimental EHL-2 and reactor-scale EHL-3B. Simulation results demonstrate that equilibrium modifications are governed by the ion Mach number ($M$). In the low-rotation regime ($M < 0.5$), multi-fluid effects are weak and solutions approach the single-fluid limit. However, at $M > 2$, strong centrifugal forces drive significant boron accumulation at the low-field side (LFS) and generate an internal electrostatic potential on the order of 10 kV.

The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments."}

Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence.

Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method."}

We introduce \\emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \\ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \\emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \\emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \\emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \\emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \\emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains."}

In WPTS, fluid elements in strongly turbulent regions are represented by Lagrangian particles that travel a finite distance before interacting with the background flow field represented in a wave-like (Eulerian) form. This mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the discrete fluid parcels invoked in the Prandtl mixing-length picture. WPTS differs from conventional mixing-length-based turbulence models in two key respects. First, particle evolution follows a non-equilibrium transport mechanism, rather than the equilibrium assumptions typically embedded in eddy-viscosity closures. Second, WPTS advances the wave and particle components in a coupled manner, with the particle fraction governed primarily by the modeled turbulence characteristic time, enabling laminar and turbulent regimes to be represented within a unified framework. Because spatially developing jets provide a canonical test case with well-established similarity behavior, they are used here for evaluation. Specifically, this work (1) develops a mixing-length-based characteristic-time model tailored to jet flows and (2) incorporates it into WPTS to assess predictive performance. The resulting WPTS framework accurately reproduces the jet similarity solution and other characteristic features at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 20,000, demonstrating the promise of WPTS as a practical tool for turbulence modeling and simulation."}

Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $α\\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $α\\wedge\\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $α$ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $α= \\frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $α>\\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results."}

Djitte", "Franck Sueur"], "title": "A Lions' type formula for some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of fractional harmonic functions", "categories": ["math.AP"], "comment": "11 pages", "summary": "In \\cite{Lions}, J. L. Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \\cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by Hörmander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula. We observe, in particular, that despite the order of the operator not being $2$, this formula resembles the Hadamard variational formula that we prove in the companion paper \\cite{sidy-franck_1}. As a complementary remark, we observe that for a family of RKHS associated with the steady Stokes system, a second order system, there is also a Lions' type formula for their two-point kernels, which turn out not to be similar to the corresponding Hadamard variation formula."}

These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well."}

Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moiré materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information."}

These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2]. Lastly, we solve the three-phase Stefan problems numerically to demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy terms during phase change of smaller (nano) particles. In contrast, these effects diminish for large particles (microns and larger)."}

Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift.

Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials."}

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior.

In contrast to the celebrated minimizing movements scheme, the proposed strategy does not rely on any time-discretization or iterative constructions. Instead, it provides a direct method based on the relaxation of the problem in spaces of measures, constrained by the continuity equation: in this procedure, no gap is introduced due to the Ambrosio's superposition principle.\n  Within this weak convex framework, the validity of the null-minimization property is recovered through two further steps. First, a careful application of the Von Neumann minimax theorem yields an identification of the dual problem as a supremum over the set of smooth and bounded cylinder functions, solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-type inequality. Secondly, a suitable \"backward boundedness\" property of solutions to such Hamilton-Jacobi system gives a proper bound of the dual problem, ensuring that the minimum value of the original functional is actually zero.\n  The proposed strategy naturally extends to non-autonomous equations, encompassing time- and space-dependent dissipation potentials and time-dependent potential energies."}

The main result is a nice combination of Karoui's asymptotic analysis with procedures of constrained low rank matrix approximations. More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime.

Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases."}

We establish a comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions of the DPP, which yields stability results under minimal and natural hypotheses. As a consequence, we prove existence of viscosity solutions of the DPP and their convergence to viscosity solutions of a PDE that is consistent with the underlying approximation scheme. Moreover, we show that solutions of the limiting PDE admit an asymptotic expansion encoded by the approximation operator. Finally, we demonstrate that a broad class of local, nonlocal, and nonlinear partial differential equations fits into our framework, recovering known examples in the literature and completing gaps in the existing literature."}

This is a refinement to the recent partial positive answer to Tao's conjecture [Tao21] as given in [BP21b]. The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term. An obstacle to doing this is that, in the Carleman inequalities, the forcing term is amplified on large scales. Additionally, the low regularity of the forcing requires the addition of Caccioppoli-type estimates to deal with the Carleman inequalities appropriately."}

Global strain conservation implements a nonlocal inhibitory effect, realizing a mechanochemical variant of the local activation--long-range inhibition mechanism. For exponential elasticity-morphogen coupling, the system admits a variational formulation. We prove existence of nonconstant steady states for small diffusion and uniqueness of the homogeneous state for large diffusion. Linear stability analysis shows that only unimodal patterns are stable, while multimodal solutions are unstable. Bifurcation analysis reveals subcritical and supercritical pitchforks, with fold bifurcations generating bistable regimes.

By systematically expanding the input-output dynamics of fluctuations about the laminar base flow with respect to forcing amplitude, we establish a rigorous correspondence between linear resolvent analysis and higher-order nonlinear interactions. At second order, quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves generate steady streamwise streaks via the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of these streaks is captured by the second output singular function of the streamwise-constant resolvent operator. At higher orders, nonlinear coupling between oblique waves and induced streaks acts as structured forcing of the laminar linearized dynamics, yielding additional streak components whose relative phase governs reinforcement or attenuation of the leading-order streak response. Our analysis identifies a critical forcing amplitude marking the breakdown of the weakly nonlinear regime, beyond which direct numerical simulations exhibit sustained unsteadiness. We show that this breakdown coincides with the onset of secondary instability, revealing that the nonlinear interactions responsible for streak formation also drive the modal growth central to classical transition theory. The resulting framework provides a mechanistically transparent and computationally efficient description of transition that unifies non-modal amplification, streak formation, and modal instability within a single formulation derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations."}
