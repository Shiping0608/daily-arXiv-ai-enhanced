Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction.

L. Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \\cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by H\u00f6rmander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula.

These phenomena often occur concurrently. A prototypical 1D model for understanding the phase change phenomena is the Stefan problem. There is a large body of literature discussing the analytical solution to the two-phase Stefan problem that describes only the melting or boiling of phase change materials (PCMs) with one moving interface. Density-change effects that induce additional fluid flow during phase change are generally neglected in the literature to simplify the math of the Stefan problem. In our recent work [1], we provide analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation in Cartesian coordinates. Our current work builds on our previous work to solve a more challenging problem: the three-phase Stefan problem in spherical coordinates for finite-sized particles. There are three moving interfaces in this system: the melt front, the boiling front, and the outer boundary which is in contact with the atmosphere. Although an analytical solution could not be found for this problem, we solved the governing equations using a fixed-grid sharp-interface method with second-order spatio-temporal accuracy. Using a small-time analytical solution, we predict a reasonably accurate estimate of temperature (in the three phases) and interface positions and velocities at the start of the simulation. Our numerical method is validated by reproducing the two-phase nanoparticle melting results of Font et al. [2].

A key feature of our approach is that it bypasses any measurability requirement on solutions of the DPP, an assumption that is often difficult to verify and may even fail in relevant examples. We establish a comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions of the DPP, which yields stability results under minimal and natural hypotheses. As a consequence, we prove existence of viscosity solutions of the DPP and their convergence to viscosity solutions of a PDE that is consistent with the underlying approximation scheme. Moreover, we show that solutions of the limiting PDE admit an asymptotic expansion encoded by the approximation operator. Finally, we demonstrate that a broad class of local, nonlocal, and nonlinear partial differential equations fits into our framework, recovering known examples in the literature and completing gaps in the existing literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a viscosity-based solution concept for approximation schemes like dynamic programming principles, bypassing measurability requirements and establishing comparison principles for stability and convergence to PDE solutions.", "motivation": "To develop a viscosity solution framework for general approximation schemes that avoids difficult-to-verify measurability requirements on DPP solutions, which can fail in relevant examples, and to provide a unified approach for various PDE types.", "method": "Introduces viscosity-based notion of solution for approximation schemes; establishes comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions; proves stability results under minimal hypotheses; shows convergence to PDE solutions; demonstrates asymptotic expansions encoded by approximation operators.", "result": "Existence of viscosity solutions for DPPs and their convergence to viscosity solutions of consistent PDEs; asymptotic expansions for limiting PDE solutions; framework applicable to local, nonlocal, and nonlinear PDEs, recovering known examples and completing gaps in literature.", "conclusion": "The viscosity-based framework provides a robust solution concept for approximation schemes that bypasses measurability issues, establishes strong stability and convergence properties, and offers a unified approach applicable to diverse PDE classes."}}

This is a refinement to the recent partial positive answer to Tao's conjecture [Tao21] as given in [BP21b]. The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term. An obstacle to doing this is that, in the Carleman inequalities, the forcing term is amplified on large scales.

By systematically expanding the input-output dynamics of fluctuations about the laminar base flow with respect to forcing amplitude, we establish a rigorous correspondence between linear resolvent analysis and higher-order nonlinear interactions. At second order, quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves generate steady streamwise streaks via the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of these streaks is captured by the second output singular function of the streamwise-constant resolvent operator. At higher orders, nonlinear coupling between oblique waves and induced streaks acts as structured forcing of the laminar linearized dynamics, yielding additional streak components whose relative phase governs reinforcement or attenuation of the leading-order streak response. Our analysis identifies a critical forcing amplitude marking the breakdown of the weakly nonlinear regime, beyond which direct numerical simulations exhibit sustained unsteadiness. We show that this breakdown coincides with the onset of secondary instability, revealing that the nonlinear interactions responsible for streak formation also drive the modal growth central to classical transition theory.
