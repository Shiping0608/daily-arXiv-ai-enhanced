Due to the measure-theoretic underpinnings, the approach has raised theoretical interest, leading to a rather comprehensive description in infinite-dimensional function spaces. The goal of this article is to bridge the infinite-dimensional theory for linear inverse problems in distribution spaces and associated computational inverse problems without resorting to a discrete approximation of the forward model. We will shown that under certain assumptions, discretization of the unknown of interest is not necessary for the numerical treatment of the problem, the only approximations required being numerical quadratures that are independent of any discrete representation of the unknown.

The scheme is unconditionally uniform in time stable in the sense that the numerical solution admits a time uniform bound in Linfinity over time with values in L2 to the power d whenever the external forcing term is uniformly bounded in time in L2, for all Reynolds numbers and for arbitrary choices of time step sizes.\n  At each time step, the method requires the solution of two time dependent Stokes problems, which can be evaluated explicitly in the periodic setting using Fourier techniques, along with the solution of a single scalar cubic algebraic equation. Beyond the standard exponential time differencing framework, the proposed scheme incorporates two recently developed ingredients. The first is a dynamic second order scalar auxiliary variable correction, which is essential for achieving second order temporal accuracy. The second is a mean reverting scalar auxiliary variable multistep formulation, which plays a central role in ensuring long time stability.\n  The proposed methods overcome key limitations of existing approaches for the Navier Stokes equations. Classical Runge Kutta schemes generally lack provable long time stability, while IMEX and scalar auxiliary variable based BDF methods typically do not admit unconditional stability guarantees in the variable step setting. Numerical experiments in two spatial dimensions confirm second order temporal accuracy, uniform long time stability, and effective error control provided by the adaptive strategy. Rigorous convergence analysis and a systematic investigation of long time statistical properties will be pursued in future work."}

The complexity of the underlying physics and the heterogeneity of experimental data pose formidable challenges for conventional numerical methods, while simultaneously highlights the promise of modern data-native AI approaches. A major obstacle in realizing this potential is, however, the lack of curated, openly available datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing fusion datasets are scarce, fragmented across institutions, facility-specific, and inconsistently annotated, which limits reproducibility and prevents a fair and scalable comparison of AI approaches. In this paper, we introduce TokaMark, a structured benchmark to evaluate AI models on real experimental data collected from the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). TokaMark provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to (i) unify access to multi-modal heterogeneous fusion data (ii) harmonize formats, metadata, temporal alignment and evaluation protocols to enable consistent cross-model and cross-task comparisons. The benchmark includes a curated list of 14 tasks spanning a range of physical mechanisms, exploiting a variety of diagnostics and covering multiple target use cases. A baseline model is provided to facilitate transparent comparison and validation within a unified framework. By establishing a unified benchmark for both the fusion and AI-for-science communities, TokaMark aims to accelerate progress in data-driven plasma AI modeling, contributing to the broader goal of achieving sustainable and stable fusion energy.

The primary wave capture structure consists of a flap hinged at the seabed or to a floating platform. Different flap configurations, including single and dual-flap, have been investigated. The separation distance between the oscillating surge wave energy converters can have an impact on their response when deployed in arrays. We consider the case of a dual-flap oscillating surge wave energy converter and investigate the impact of the separation distance between them on the performance of each flap. We estimate the absorbed wave energy and the annual energy production by the two flaps when deployed at the PacWave South site. Inviscid numerical simulations were conducted to predict the response of the oscillating surge wave energy converters. The simulations are validated with experimental measurements of a 1:10 scaled model in a wave tank. The results show that for a short separation distance, the interaction between the oscillating surge wave energy converters has a destructive and constructive effect depending on the wave frequency. However, these effects tend to balance each other out when considering the broad range of wave excitations. For longer separation distances, the interaction always results in a constructive effect. The results reveal that the separation distance has an insignificant impact on annual energy production when considering all wave frequencies and amplitudes."}

However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ''missing link'' that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos."}

Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations."}

We first establish a compact bound on the norm of the residual difference between the solutions of the LS and sLS problems, which is the first key result towards understanding the rationale of the sLS problem. Then from the perspective of backward errors, we prove that the solution of the sLS problem is the one of a certain perturbed LS problem with minimal backward error, and quantify how the embedded quality affects the residuals, solution errors, and the relative residual norms of normal equations of the LS and sLS problems. These theoretical results enable us to propose new novel and reliable general-purpose stopping criteria for iterative solvers for the sLS problem, which dynamically monitor stabilization patterns of iterative solvers for the LS problem itself and terminate them at the earliest iteration. Numerical experiments justify the theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the new stopping criteria work reliably and result in a tremendous reduction in computational cost without sacrificing attainable accuracy."}

For the linear system without rotation, stratification not only suppresses the lift-up effect but also exhibits certain dispersion effects, except for some points where degradation occurs, which will bring essential difficulties to nonlinear estimates. In contrast, when rotation is taken into account, we observe that this degeneracy in dispersion effects disappears; furthermore, we can derive dispersive estimates for the second and third components of the simple-zero mode within the velocity field. Additionally, we develop three good unknowns to minimize linear coupling terms as much as possible while mitigating growth induced by linear stretching terms; through constructing a series of multipliers, we achieve enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping effects. In our analysis of the nonlinear system aimed at establishing an improved stability threshold, we utilize quasi-linearization methods to rectify deficiencies in dispersive estimates related to both the first component of velocity and temperature, as well as address regularity issues along vertical directions caused by buoyancy forces and stratification.

While the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability within the Berk-Breizman framework has served as a canonical model for understanding such phenomena, a unified nonlinear description remains incomplete when drag, diffusion, and Krook relaxation act simultaneously. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the BOT instability that explicitly retains all three collision operators together with external wave damping. Using a validated characteristic-based BOT code, we systematically scan the multi-dimensional collision parameter space and construct nonlinear regime maps and bifurcation diagrams. To organize the rich dynamics, we introduce a two-level categorization that combines global wave-energy evolution with chirping subtypes identified from spectral morphology. We find that diffusion and Krook relaxation regularize the nonlinear dynamics and promote ordered transitions from chaotic behaviors to periodic oscillations and steady saturation as collision strength increases, with the saturation level decreasing approximately exponentially with external damping. In contrast, drag alone does not admit steady solutions and instead drives persistent or chaotic chirping through convective deformation of resonant phase-space structures. When drag is combined with diffusion or Krook relaxation, clear transition sequences emerge: increasing drag breaks hole-clump symmetry, broadens the effective resonance region, and drives systematic transitions from transient to intermittent and persistent chirping."}

In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation."}

The key challenge stems from the degeneracy of $f(x)$, which leads to a more complex structure of the free boundary compared to the classical setting. To analyze it, we introduce the epiperimetric inequality developed by Weiss (Invent Math 138:23-50, 1999). Although this powerful tool was firstly introduced for the classical obstacle problem characterized by $f(x)>0$ in B_1, it also proves effective in our degenerate setting. This allows us to first obtain the decay rate of the Weiss energy for all blow-ups at the origin, which in turn implies the uniqueness of the blow-up profiles. With this uniqueness established, we then prove a very weak directional monotonicity properties satisfied by the solutions.

We present arguments showing that a plasma in thermal equilibrium undergoing anisotropic compression or expansion cannot return to thermal equilibrium in the absence of particle collisions.

In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models."}

The corresponding Wiener--Hopf formulation leads to an equation with a $4 \\times 4$ matrix kernel, which reduces to a $2 \\times 2$ matrix kernel under some symmetry assumptions. The factorisation prospects of this kernel are discussed, but this route is not followed. Instead, an exact analytical solution is obtained using the pole removal technique. This contrasts with the continuous case, where only approximate solutions are currently available. The reflection and transmission coefficients resulting from an incident duct mode are computed with an accuracy up to $10^{-13}$, showing consistency with theoretical predictions from continuous waveguide theory. In particular, full reflection and zero transmission are recovered as the frequency approaches the cut-off value for the incident mode. Finally, the solution is validated against a numerical computation of the diffraction problem via the Boundary Algebraic Equations method with a tailored lattice Green's function."}

Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.\n  We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports."}

The resulting stationary states possess flat-top profiles with sharp edges and are referred to as super-Gaussons, in analogy with the Gaussian Gaussons of the classical logarithmic NLS (log-NLS). The model, which we call the logarithmic-power NLS (logp-NLS), is parameterized by an exponent $p\\geq1$ that controls the degree of flatness of the soliton core and the sharpness of its decay. Mathematically, $p$ interpolates between the standard log-NLS ($p=1$) and increasingly flat-top profiles as $p$ increases, while physically it governs the stiffness of an underlying logarithmic-power compressibility law. The proposed equation is constructed so as to admit super-Gaussian stationary states and can be interpreted a posteriori within a generalized pressure-law framework, thereby extending the log-NLS. We investigate the dynamics of super-Gaussons in one spatial dimension through numerical simulations for various values of $p$, demonstrating how this parameter regulates both the internal structure of the soliton and its collision dynamics. The logp-NLS thus generalizes the standard log-NLS by admitting a broader family of localized states with distinctive structural and dynamical properties, suggesting its relevance for flat-top solitons in nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and related nonlinear media."}

In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $ω$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation."}

We then adopt the Lie group variational integrator technique to obtain a discrete model of the rod incorporating both rotational motion and cross-sectional deformation as well. The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system."}

Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations."}

Our semi-implicit scheme couples a modified state equation with a parameter evolution law that is driven by model-data residuals. We demonstrate four benchmark problems of increasing complexity: the Darcy flow, the Fisher-KPP equation, a nonlinear potential equation and finally, an Allen-Cahn type equation.

Chi"], "title": "Large Scale High-Dimensional Reduced-Rank Linear Discriminant Analysis", "categories": ["stat.CO", "math.NA"], "comment": null, "summary": "Reduced-rank linear discriminant analysis (RRLDA) is a foundational method of dimension reduction for classification that has been useful in a wide range of applications. The goal is to identify an optimal subspace to project the observations onto that simultaneously maximizes between-group variation while minimizing within-group differences. The solution is straight forward when the number of observations is greater than the number of features but computational difficulties arise in both the high-dimensional setting, where there are more features than there are observations, and when the data are very large. Many works have proposed solutions for the high-dimensional setting and frequently involve additional assumptions or tuning parameters. We propose a fast and simple iterative algorithm for both classical and high-dimensional RRLDA on large data that is free from these additional requirements and that comes with guarantees. We also explain how RRLDA-RK provides implicit regularization towards the least norm solution without explicitly incorporating penalties. We demonstrate our algorithm on real data and highlight some results."}

As a result, we introduce a new solution to the electrovacuum system in the Majumdar-Papapetrou class that is invariant under an $(n-1)$-dimensional group of dilations."}
